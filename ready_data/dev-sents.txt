tell me your name again .
just rinse them out a little bit
and you say , well , i made it though , at least it 's mine .
and you put it on a platter .

in general on this project we 're suppose to talk about
shoot them .
take it to a logical extreme ,
well , you go ahead .
uh , go ahead ,

so , uh ,
well , even if that 's
and ,
i mean that 's ,
your ,
and .
and the ,
it was ,
and i believe in the , in a certain , uh ,
and the kinds of knowledge that , uh , you know ,
well , and , i , i ,
yeah .
my ,
well , uh .
so .
and i really ,
that ,
i ,
on ,
there 's a ,
is that near , near the , what do they ,

he and i ,
if you , you ,
and it just a li- ,
well , practical
yeah ,
um .
and i think ,
and ,
well , i think i 've , um ,
and then i like , um ,
i do n't know how ,
i mean , what it 's ,
and how ,
now see i .
the , uh ,
if it was ,
that , uh ,
but , you know , having this dog
you know , it ,
well ,
well see , i think , you know ,
i , uh ,
so .
so , uh .
i ,
but .
but .
you all , uh , have some ,
it would really , um ,
uh , i ,
it 's not , um ,
so .
there is ,
i mean i ,
and ,
so ,
or manage money or know ,
we- ,
but --
so .
but the ,
and , they want ,
well ,
but , uh ,
well ,
and that 's ,
i just ,
we were getting ,
and they 're allow , you know , th- ,
huh .
but , uh , one ,
so , do you ...
uh , because they were just ,
i work ,
yeah .
but .
so .
and you just ,
so ,
so it seems , uh ,
but , uh .
well ,
yeah .
w- ,
so .
but , uh ,
so .
and i ,
but ,
there 's ,
huh .
it 's quite ,
but that , that , that 's the ,
and so they --
well , i just , uh , we 've , you know
oh , go- ,
that is good about ,
it 's , um ,
and he , you know ,
it is ,
or ,
it 's really ,
b- ,
i just ,
well , you realize ...
uh ,
just ,
and with , we have , uh ,
and i think , you know , again
and there are a few in some of the more , like in
you know , i got , uh , um ,
and ,
and , um , and it really ,
yes .
is it , you know --
or ,
that 's ,
and i , you know ,
and with all the ,
um .
the ,
so , that 's .
but it 's ,
and it 's just ,
in a case like that , most of the time its ,
in ,
so ,
and they had ,
and they ,
but ,
so ,
well n- ,
but ,
the ,
so --
so .
i think that 's ,
i , uh , i
and ,
it 's ,
so .
i , i ,
and ,
i , i ,
guy just , you know ,
but ,
is it ,
y- ,
it , uh , it , it , it 's ,
but , uh , i do n't know . it 's just ,
would ,
i have n't really , really ,
your imagination --
and , and they get , you know ,
just in what we see
so we kind of , uh ,
so .
in .
but have since , uh ,
been ,
yeah ,
new orleans the same story
so , i wa- ,
and , uh ,
and ,
if it 's ,
the little ,
well , i mean , l- ,
yeah .
but ,
uh-huh .
do you kind of just ,
i 've got ,
but ,
well , i 'm not , uh , i ,
and , uh ,
so .
well , we ha ,
and we ,
uh ,
i , uh ,
anyway , um , i guess it 's ,
huh .
but ,
so yo- , i am ,
it 's , uh ,
huh .
um .
that 's a ,
is that ,
on the , the ,
s- ,
or ,
and , uh , you see how ,
ha ,
separate them
but , the , um ,
so , uh ,
one of the reasons is
and , what , i 'm , i 'm curious .
but , um , their ,
and , uh , yeah ,
it 's not ,
and , uh .
but ,
well , myself i always , tr- ,
and that ,
i do n't know if ,
and mumblex .
i just , uh ,
the ,
or ,
i went to the ,
mumblex it is n't ,
and ,
so .
but they 'll ,
um .
so what ,
um .
but , uh , you know ,
but ,
well ,
i just would n't ,
so , but yeah ,
um , yeah
it 's ,
yeah ,
i , uh ,
well ,
yeah ,
so she ,
yeah ,
what , uh ,
or ,
i .
so i 've never ,
and he , you know ,
oh , it was , well ,
that 's ,
huh .
and that ,
it 's one of ,
but i mean , it 's , it 's like that ,
so , i ,
i guess , if it were , if , if ,
and that was ,
so , uh --
and , uh , kids kind of ,
i tell you what i ,
so ,
huh .
so ,
but it 's --
uh ...
and i know as a middle class , uh , you know ,
that , you know , that 's ,
i 'm not sure , though , whether i feel ,
yeah ,
if , i would sell the , you know ,
so .
um .
um .
but ,
and ,
from what i 've he ,
but that 's just kind of ,
people , you know ,
well , it ,
um , a lot ,
and ,
but ,
and , uh ,
an , i- ,
well , we , you know --
but , anyway . well ,
i do n't ,
and i ,
well , i ,
-- so , uh .
and i just ,
so ,
but ,
you know , that ,
um .
seem to be ,
um .
and , it surprised ,
and it 's , uh ,
yeah ,
uh-huh .
so .
there ,
and i just ,
so ,
maybe it 's ,
and --
i 'm , i ,
in , in ,
but , tha- , --
yeah .
well ,
but if it 's ,
wha ,
i s- ,
oh , it was jus- ,
that ,
uh .
really it was ,
and ,
you would ,
and so , it 's kind of ,
now , what i was , you know ,
so ,
we come from a ,
but a lot of ,
it 's just not as ,
but , but since you have an o u drop out as a quarterback ,
and an- ,
so .
the , um ,
but ,
is n't it ,
there 's not ,
we ,
-- but i , uh ,
and , uh .
oh , that 's ,
growing ,
and no- ,
it 's a- ,

that ,
what 's the ,
i just ,
yeah ,
so .
of course , being part of the european community , if everybody else did it they , they were probably much more ,

huh-uh .
no ,
no ,
no ,
uh , i do n't know .
i do n't know , because i know i do n't watch , while i 'm up here at school , i do n't watch hardly any t v .
uh , sort of on a peripheral .
well , i used to be a real big cowboy fan
most of our vacations are to go and see grandma and grandpa .
uh , when i can .
well , i am a school teacher .
well , maybe it would .
-- i , i have no idea ,
the home improvements .
i do n't know
i do n't know .
ooh , well i do n't know .
do n't , do n't ask me .
um , i 've never noticed that .
i 've never actually , never actually played it .
i mean , that 's exactly what it is , you know ,
i 'm not sure if they had one yet ,
uh , well i have n't tried that .
uh , i saw seven eleven that was hiring .
i , i do n't know
oh , i do n't know ,
well flower gardens .
uh , i do n't remember , to tell you the truth .
i do n't really know , um ,
i do n't know ,
well , who knows .
uh , i ca n't remember .
that 's right ,
right .
i think it would .
it would be really nice because i 'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes .
chinese
well , we test every one electrically .
i did for years .
right .
so , i 'm , i 've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get ,
right .
i , i think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that 's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line .
it 's a , it 's a debit card ,
oh , probably .
you can get recordings .
okay ,
that 's right , you know ,
um , a little bit ,
uh , about seven minutes .
um , i guess . from , from something that the car was , uh , was giving ,
i ,
i , i , yeah , i 'm , yeah , i , i do aerobics , uh , step classes and , uh ,
i 'm a contract person at t i --
that 's the barrios
my husband 's ,
it is ,
um , well , the conductor gets paid a little bit , you know ,
right .
and so i read a lot of books
well , uh , i have thought about it ,
um , sure .
just about .
right ,
well , we did ,
sure .
right .
oh definitely .
i guess i usually do .
oh , absolutely .
oh , that is wonderful .
exactly .
uh , i think what we did was good ,
i guess we might as well .
i understand it very well
oh , absolutely .
it is ,
of course .
probably ,
it 's , uh , it , uh , it does ,
right .
right .
i 'm sure ,
oh , it was great , because , uh , well , the times that were really fun were when , uh , we had vacation
well , i kind of like them all .
that is correct .
both , yeah , both females ,
oh , it 's a wonderful place to live ,
some buildings do ,
but ,
right ,
sometimes .
that 's right ,
sometimes ,
i think so .
right .
it is . it is hard --
well , absolutely .
green card .
that 's right .
right .
well , i crochet ,
well i could have ,
that is pretty much it .
well that 's , that 's certainly true ,
uh , to a degree .
uh , probably so , just because they were under his authority
uh , we do here .
well , it does .
oh , okay ,
well , i guess i do ,
so to speak .
certainly do .
that 's right .
right .
oh , i 'm sure he does .
-- because i think we should have well-rounded kids --
-- his life just went down the drain .
as far as they are concerned ,
-- by , you know , the masses --
-- at one time ?
to your child 's education
we 're going to see a generation of kids that , you know , are just going to be a little bit , uh , oh , not very nurturing .
-- put against , uh , uh , stock portfolio .
-- where you ,
-- say they do , they like the best .
-- april and may .
their school .
if their , if their , you know , arrest record wo n't let abl- , wo n't let them play anywhere else , they seem to go to , they seem to go to the raiders .
-- i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing .
-- that you can use in the , uh , impact machines or whatever , you ,
-- a lot of people are n't going to get up , walk out of their offices and go there .
part of these costs like the people on death row --
-- a student ?
-- with a seat in the back .
-- like i used to be in that research --
the , the , ne , near , uh , dahran .
that 's somewhat fun .
at home ,
be a go , a good adjudicator ?
-- and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over .
-- which is probably the best movie i 've seen ever .
-- and , um , the family
does n't ,
you know , you get all prepared
-- if it 's , uh , any large purchases , uh , you 've got to kind of think about , uh , how much you 're going to put down as far as , uh , payments on it so that you 're not getting eighteen percent or --
that 's right .
-- here in raleigh ,
-- drive or wherever we ,
was able to , you know ,
do forestry work .
-- that kind of thing .
-- quite the same .
back , as we get older , you know .
-- we just left it alone .
-- you know ,
i dread that the next time .
leaned the wrong way .
and their expertise or whatever .
-- spend an evening .
-- fifty some years old you try , try to find insurance .
-- and , uh , i do n't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things , where i 've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it , uh , i might do something differently .
their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever ,
the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home .
you know .
it adheres better , or lasts longer ?
kind of store ,
and , uh , uh , take some of those holidays away from them , like columbus day , president 's day ,
-- all of us children would help her --
and ,
if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth .
-- and very peculiar things that people do with each other
-- a coat .
-- wife also gets a lot of the food magazines . bon appetite , and food and wine and gourmet .
got caught for running a drug ring .
and it 's like ,
-- in one set .
in california they make you register when you buy ammunition .
-- that would be something .
-- and back and forth , and what a light show .
associated with government , he should be held up to the light for that .
you just ca n't believe how much paper that you , uh ,
in the movie .
-- because they 'll give you some money back , you know ,
-- type movie ,
buy a used car ?
that we throw out on the ground
you know , where you can get foods that , you know , where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the --
-- thirteen years ago ,
-- you know , like --
-- given you some ideas --
and so forth and so on .
junk .
-- very quiet and very smooth riding machine .
-- improves , i think the housing will go up .
ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human ?
-- and a package of lipton onion soup mix --
they actually show you what duckwork and things .
-- and ever since ,
-- i can just do it .
and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in
-- he got a job down there .
and , and chops them up in recipes --
who , who
you know , that they were going to do all them first .
-- from the city .
-- it certainly , uh ,
-- paper at all .
-- uh , carcinogenic causing items --
in the regular trash .
-- left .
-- especially when you work out of town and everything , that way .
-- takes something like twenty times as long to decompose .
-- the , the school systems --
um , for economical reasons , not for preference .
prime time live .
-- because , uh , we have , uh , armadillos .
that they have ,
-- you know , with , with ,
-- in the future , i think , maybe to help in some ways .
-- uh , well , you know , something coming off from the bank like they usually do .
-- we have gone on trips where we bathed in streams .
when they were older , than they did when they were ,
that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste .
of world , world events --
-- for , at twelve , five --
-- the real hot spot of the future so to speak .
-- in day cares and in mother 's day out programs , and --
s- , soy sauce or whatever ,
your decision ?
i 'll just die .
you know ,
-- of society .
we did ,
-- have , were here last summer that ,
rather than a home .
-- were even in there one day a week --
-- that , uh .
-- for it later .
-- here 's the situation of this kid at home , you know ,
and what 's going on in the world .
-- urban society .
-- as , you know , what they had originally shown me ,
-- and committed the robbery .
-- so that i do not have to have a , uh --
and , uh , do we have to wait until all the landfills ,
-- that it was christmas eve .
-- a ,
-- without having the kids jump in and ...
-- do more ,
i always have , or letter writing ,
-- is buyer beware .
-- in there .
-- them to a degree .
-- how deep they dig into things and such .
-- up to several years ago .
that as they , you know , are ,
for now .
and then the brown bottles .
may be a problem .
there .
-- just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time
-- i bet , huh .
they ,
are looking at those , uh , bills that come in , and those statements ,
-- of , not a whole large group of them , but , uh , just a few . most of them centered around , uh , drug territory .
-- do everything at once .
-- we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
-- uh , after ,
like that .
as much as , uh , defending your life ,
and mario cuomo --
-- and then th- , you know , they 'll get out
-- it can be a tot- , or injuries that , uh , have newly happened --
-- send and receive faxes right over there without using , you know ,
-- selfish and shortsighted .
a lot because you can feed your own family
to go do ,
it may come down to where it 's , it 's individual basis . where everybody is treated an as individual ,
-- a young boy in that .
uh , you know , church that comes on ?
all of a sudden you look and there 's three , uh , three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
-- read one book , i think it was calls trial by jury of all things , that , uh --
-- it 's a full day .
-- express ?
-- or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering .
and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing . um ,
then maybe they can pay you more .
appliances and things like that
uh , and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind . and then another half an hour , you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff .
-- and just talk for five minutes .
-- you do n't point it at people ,
doctorate degree in computer science center at berkeley .
-- anymore , uh ,
-- all ,
really do .
where the dresses are beginning to drag --
i thought they would ,
without charging people .
-- and then basically made a cutoff ,
-- gone the full circle .
is it concealed ,
anymore .
-- probably a little bit different than what you serve up in pennsylvania for a dinner party .
-- and t v -s and everything ,
-- which we do not want built
-- are not there all the time
you know ,
-- smaller companies have bonus plans , where i think in a large company it 's hard to do that because there 're just so many people to deal with --
-- and not wait until they 're in high school
going to listen to this and we are going to look at this , find out what our mistakes were , and we are not going to make them again . ''
-- because of their age .
-- there 's just no respect for , for people or property ,
hope we did them some --
-- he 's , he has been going to private since kindergarten .
-- listen --
whole summer long .
if i did n't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks ,
was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home , safe , secure , and made happy
-- so that when they come out in video .
-- like that .
whether it 's through prevention or , or treatment or , you know , just , uh , just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves .
-- because they 're stuck with their grandchildren so much .
-- and i imagine that really helps his back .
less self-centered ,
-- just from walking --
if i , if it was someone in my family , i 'd probably feel that way .
uh , generally try to stay in the at least p g range .
-- and there 's no way that we can ever really recover from , from the state that we 're in right now , unless , at least i feel , unless we focus on the infra structure ,
it 's about .
-- we 'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it .
-- they were talking about drug testing us --
-- but at least traditionally , the laborers ,
uh ,
-- and , cultural change within the management first .
ca , get a quickie update on what 's going on , if we really want to .
so to speak . okay ?
you 're looking at fifteen or si- ,
utilitarian .
-- but it 's , uh , it 's quite ,
uh ,
and things like that . yeah , much more than you would think .
-- we tug back and forth who 's going to move ,
-- you , you do n't spend more than you , than you bring in .
than with a driver or something .
you know ,
-- because i , i think there 's , when you let other employees turn in people ,
-- were quiet times
-- and , of course , you get a lot from when you 're growing up .
you know .
-- per se ,
so we have been really up to our eye balls in fund raising and trying to get , uh ,
-- i do n't know
i mean ,
with this terrible recession that we are in , uh ,
uh , oriented ,
thing , you know ,
-- break them ,
-- and , uh , libretto .
-- then i 'd always wonder if they fired me , you know , why did you fire me .
-- you know , i , i would n't have to worry about satisfying my guest .
-- the united states to some extent .
-- than cut , yeah , just cut everybody back ten percent .
-- in the public .
-- as far as we 're concerned .
come back
uh , for fully automatic weapons .
because , you know , i , you know , i have interests that ,
-- a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them .
-- we 're really on to that , that the masking is ,
lucky though to have , uh , jim kelly than ,
growing up when , when the cowboys were really big .
-- think there 's very many really good day-care centers around your area ?
-- they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families .
if , if she gets it planned .
for friends of hers .
-- safely .
-- her other children burdened with his care .
to see if the ,
i , i read .
-- the fact that you know , it 's a less , long term commitment for the company --
-- dinner once in a while , you know .
-- and , uh , it had sparked an interest that , uh , of mine ,
may- ,
it 's more worth it .
go ahead finish it .
-- hear about that , that , you know ,
uh , becky ,
a lot .
-- it seems .
-- they offer .
for a favorite channel .
as long as it 's not hot .
-- on the lot ,
-- if it 's possible .
-- you know what i 'm saying , like that one where he goes to college ,
-- work all that , that anger out , and the , and the nightmares that come along with it .
-- that we , you know , uh , ran into .
the cooper clinic ,
-- and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it .
-- you know , kids that are bored , like you say .
-- and getting in and out the doors ?
to have , mai- , mainly , i guess , i get to mumblex
so , i , i 'm at the
-- in a house .
as well as i could et cetera .
but not a lot of ,
-- incidental type things , like , you know , gas and stuff like that .
and jeans and things that , you know , are sort of , um ,
to , to do something like that .
and we 've been in a state of emergency for over , you know , for ten or eleven days .
-- it 's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them .
-- to pay for what you can wind up losing , you know --
-- because i just do n't think at that age i just do n't think that young people know what they want to do .
in addition to that , we have the cost because you have to pay something for ,
a little hot , is n't it ?
breaks , you know .
you know , with the mouse you do it , you know , like , a hundred times faster .
so it was far enough away that i was away ,
and things that would ,
i
-- two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles
he 's been doing this evidently for a , a good number of years .
-- and using the leftover turkey .
-- just a really , a really funny movie .
so , i really do n't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me .
the , uh ,
you know
-- and february ,
because , you know , not a lot of people do really know what , you know , what it 's for .
boys clubs , girls clubs , things like that , that kind of get into that citizenship , uh , the uh , looking after the environment sort of thing --
building these beautiful homes ,
and opening up those stations , whatever , filling them .
oh , twelve times , of the year .
-- and i just i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it .
it 's kind of hard to , to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent ,
-- you know , because they 've got to go to bed and go to school the next day ,
took it back from the germans and never bothered to give it back ,
if i 'm going to listen to today 's country western , i have tapes of like randy travis and clint black
-- do things with them and treat them , treat like they 're ,
-- and part of it iraq and part of it something else , you know ,
-- they 're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits , the insurance claims , et cetera ,
-- nice nylons and dresses .
-- i have no time to read the news .
pretty close to english , really .
i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are
all the get smart episodes you could ever see .
-- we had a german shepherd
uh ,
you know in , in the mideast .
commissary ,
-- they keep leaving .
causes cancer ,
you know ,
i ,
-- because i 'm in computer science
now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes ,
by richard fugate
sometime is colorado .
nine and a half .
-- for their employees .
-- know that .
with gill .
julie .
spank them ,
-- refused to use them ,
-- make a meal , you know .
or three ,
-- use that sometimes .
i , i see that as being a , a , a change , uh , for the positive . kind of along the same line as , as , as the mandatory thing .
-- i understand ,
that need them .
-- until the bill comes in .
then they 're adding on , what , eighteen , nineteen , twenty percent .
stump killer , and stump , stump rotter ,
that 's what i do .
i do n't know anything about the family
really are .
who , or , who are not just motivated who really believe that their , they , their voice is heard .
-- as if , uh , if you get something back for it . you know .
a cross between a catfish and , uh , i do n't know what , a salamander .
-- you know ,
-- i 'm kind of looking forward to that one .
pickup
this is ridiculous .
-- you know , just all the time , it 's an awfully lot more humid .
you know .
fast food goes .
in , in ten , fifteen years , uh .
-- and they 're saying that people you can not take care of things yourself or like that you 're not smart enough to teach your kids how to , how to , uh , mumblex .
your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years .
you know , because you 're just used to throwing things .
from the standpoint of , of , uh , church and school and everything along the way .
with the best recipe
you know , just to look at him and decide from then .
fallen right in line for the , the , minor things
-- a good , a good southern solution .
type variations from the valleys up to the hills , the hilltops .
-- on death row ,
-- on there .
but i , i think , too , a lot of people do n't buy their warranties either because they know that when it 's that old they 're going to buy a new one ,
-- just going to correct myself .
getting things back up again .
let down .
-- i like rap music .
and stayed at home with the kids ,
and we mean it .
-- that , uh ,
-- and then into action films .
people who ca n't or do n't drive , you know ,
um , or something like that .
-- you know ,
-- that could be done .
better , better get outside and do something and not waist the day .
and white .
where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows
-- before they eve- , they just , you know , play with it , and , which in a way is nice to be able to do ,
low in fat and all that kind of stuff .
-- a soap --
soon enough .
-- is , uh , is , um , rochester red wings game .
-- this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this .
-- uh , you know ,
-- little car just to go , you know , run around town in --
seem to enjoy it .
-- and that 's really what happened to the steel industry in this country .
the war for children .
-- and they were really hearty and stayed on
it was quite large out to ,
-- rehabilitate them --
was still going strong .
-- some day when i ,
you should just put down the basics and put n a , where you do n't want to answer .
-- a whole bunch of people like except , except at christmas
twenty years or something .
if people stopped thinking like that .
right because , uh , there 's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there 's a fly paper effect
-- one of the reasons which started them off .
and hit someone , you know .
i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds .
i 'll deal with it .
i guess it 's just one of those things where if they if that 's what 's something it 's a need for them you know .
where it would have turned into more of a police action . uh , or more of a political action i guess , you getting into their governmental affairs which you really ca n't do as , as another country .
uh , or make it a little fluffier
that , i mean , if it said to spend eleven percent on something that 's what it was spent .
brought your chevy to me i could , i 'd probably have some parts ,
or blow their head off ,
we 've gone through this over and over again .
-- but it really ,
smooth thing .
-- mean for your state .
-- had to have her put to sleep last --
which is obviously the death penalty .
-- to go to disney world ,
uh-huh .
like the the , lawy- , the t i lawyers , and , uh , those that work for the , the higher executives , those secretaries . they , uh , they really dress up all the time .
-- down there .
-- anyway , uh , uh , we do , we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire --
-- occasionally .
-- watching much t v .
-- have , have a hard time with movies that are real long .
-- in , uh , day care for the reason of , of me working --
i have n't really as far as entertainment ,
-- and national geographic , i think --
which is kind of hard to take .
-- um , which is this wonderful thing you can do , um ,
before it even was an issue ,
and see what it was like .
uh , on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there .
-- in high school band and in college .
in the united states , in terms of being ,
-- not because it 's a woman 's job or a man 's job , but because it 's dirty --
because you did n't have all the extra , extra stuff ,
where i do n't think you should necessarily ban guns any , by any means ,
-- uh , on drugs .
-- then that chance sh , should be investigated .
-- cafeteria ?
-- books to buy .
-- these kids ?
real good child care at a , uh , pretty reasonable price , we think .
-- trying to come with a trade off of the costs .
you know ,
-- because you 're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it .
yeah .
that , that , uh ,
-- and , you know , for example , landscaping and , and lots of the other stuff ,
uh , who can do most phenomenal things
-- maybe a little biased , you know --
stuff like that
your standards change ?
-- serious equipment .
uh-huh .
if we get them ,
dancer , uh ,
uh , at least some companies . some of them , uh , my girlfriend , in particular , that works for a , a rental car agency
undo this .
-- uh , uh , radiator hose clamps .
you charge it .
larry mcmurtry ?
-- improvement .
and had ended up ,
when i was , when i was very young . unfortunately , a , a little bit too young to really appreciate .
and especially since he 's got inside iraq for using , you know , chemical weapons and stuff .
-- i had to do that .
thinking less of your own needs but ,
and then , you know , find a school that 's good for that .
the thing ,
for my refrigerator ,
and put some , uh , a glass rack down , so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar
boring .
-- what grub worms do ?
-- and was distributing it around .
as close ,
-- anymore like it used to be , basic respect for --
and czechoslovakia
-- that the house be painted before we bought it
do whatever i want to do with the kids , then whenever i have a meeting with a client , i 'll put a suit on .
general motors apparently has one that they 're , they 're testing ,
-- that extended .
-- that 's an awful lot , you know .
are n't they , than they are ,
had a huge garden .
can tell them what i think ,
it was like , you know , you could n't really talk and stuff , like you could when ,
-- this is the country panama , all right ?
and , the , you know , that kind of ,
kind of blow it off
so , i do things like that , you know ,
-- that we , that we work with .
yeah , about the seventh , eighth grade
-- kind of a pain in the butt .
her waiting list was just like , you know , like a year old ,
anyway my ultimate car though , the , the one that i really want is , uh , five sixty or so , mercedes ,
-- a little more interesting .
if it 's a clear and present danger , i mean it ,
-- age wise .
what kind of experience do you , do you have , then with child care ?
she , that could be turned into a classic ,
we have n't been in , you know , a lot of need yet .
going to be fine all day long .
-- especially from j c penney , uh , are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty , hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here ,
-- as the teachers in the higher grades --
-- which is only ten miles away
-- people would rather turn on the tube and , and , and ,
the true person anyway .
i do n't ,
-- b- , for the punishment aspect .
-- amount of money i was making really did n't compare .
it 's not as much --
-- of what i 'm low on .
to gripe .
but they were ,
-- although it has not disturbed me any .
much better , too .
that is our cause .
shrivels up and dies .
or some kind of something to be on , get an okay seal .
-- uh , wrongly .
-- it 's , it has helped them
which is every weekend . it 's a , it 's a different --
-- messina 's kitchen or something like that .
it 's a mark against them ,
-- all those those things ,
of the actual stuff ,
and , uh , that you have a good visit and everything .
or something ?
actually , actually a little bit later , like nineteen thirteen , nineteen twelve , nineteen thirteen .
-- i well i work for the government
-- you go to cold , cool places , that , well , i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway .
-- abraham lincoln . you know , teaching himself to read .
so i really like italian food though ,
-- going to work --
and , uh , in wisconsin we do ,
in society has changed .
or side to side , you slowly feed out more and more .
but we love being where we are .
that 's a good way to do it .
from work
and much of the new stuff that 's coming out ,
soci , social morals were a little bit lacking .
-- to activate it .
-- of , uh , compensation ,
uh , makes , um , uh , decisions that i just ca n't go along with .
-- as a matter of fact ,
now things are different
-- probably the biggest .
-- game magazine , which has puzzles and things --
-- it 's nice , really nice place .
really looked bad .
wanting to spend more time with my children ,
-- a law suit .
get any care ,
you know , uh , just depending ,
they have receptacles that , you know ,
-- and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty ,
uh , um , have you ever wanted to , like guitar or piano or ,
because there 's , i mean there 's like , it 's like there 's no hope , you know , like what hitler did , you know .
-- i , i 'm in raleigh
-- or something , then we usually sit out there .
that we use for the rest of the month ,
-- and los angeles and a- , rest of california which is just terrible it sounds .
standard engine in it .
once i got into this , uh , internship , i learned all the physiological ad- , advan- , advantages to it ,
-- i have a few ideas of , um , how to combat it .
-- or give away as gifts .
regardless of the racial makeup ,
against your will .
i used to work , uh ,
-- i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there --
-- and keeping your bills down , uh ,
-- when we had to have the money --
-- seen one .
-- perhaps
because there 's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere .
reading it in the morning .
a ,
a particular type ?
around it , you know , that were , you know , was there nineteen of them or , or whatever ,
maybe like thirty minutes
-- animal that could hunt and still be in the house .
-- and i know that some parents , they both do have to work ,
-- to give it a textured sort of a look ,
that might happen ye- ,
a blackening seasoning .
well , i 'm trying to see .
-- of like when the buffalos are , when they 're chasing the buffalos and everything --
-- it can be done again .
-- you know ,
-- move our , our political system s- , sort of seems to be taking .
-- both running , running backs and , and defense .
-- probably would n't be interested ,
-- it is very warm here , which is typical for this part of the , time of the year .
of much less .
-- program .
-- that kind of thing .
housework and get ev- , everything prepared and utensils and just , just everything .
sensors and things like that .
-- your thighs , and your butt .
-- uh , try and stick with that
-- just not sitting down at all .
and also through coupons .
or perhaps is using it for education .
-- and figure out ,
to have a need .
-- it 's like , uh , yes ,
-- i can live ,
that did n't go to college
we do n't even want to think about it
i think i 'll enjoy doing ,
which makes it , you know ,
you know ,
you know ,
-- that 's more readily available , you know ,
something that i really do n't understand is when someone goes to jail --
um , we 're , we 're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could ,
do n't think that , uh , that it works that way .
-- writing lesson plans .
-- approve it ?
-- and , uh , i do n't think anybody roots differently
you know , a large , large percent
giving us things to do with the children .
-- to , to toss out .
on the jury .
-- are not motivated .
-- to pay the unit off or whatever .
will win
-- what am i working for today .
-- some problem like that .
-- uh , benefit that i , that i enjoyed , and i do miss
there , although this year we 're going out .
-- and make it into insulation
-- you know , twelve or fifteen thousand miles ,
-- has that ,
because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people ,
might would ,
-- with like little or no money , would n't --
and watch it on monday night ,
-- your budget , you know .
-- and i think , too , noticing the kids , that the fourth and fifth graders , which is what my son is --
and , and living .
-- in going to school is just totally different .
which is up kind of near denver .
-- clean up their act
-- work , then you get a tax credit for that .
-- in several areas ,
the ,
it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying ,
is it all voluntary ?
that 's part of it .
i , i mean i have n't studied the statistics well enough to ,
and use it
-- they say that swimming is real good ,
if you could find them that worked .
right behind the houston oilers ,
and , uh , seams that need to be really strong , need to be done on the sewing machine .
and so now that i 've gotten , you know , i lost the house . now that i 've gotten past that , i can sit down and say , okay ,
it 's a good deal , too .
that can be harmful .
-- it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shir- , that 's got to be very short term .
way i guess most of the um the
look how much it 's changed an .
they always talk about mumblex they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what
-- bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of --
because everybody knew , they knew ahead of time how many people to expect .
just on some of the tapes .
two nights is good .
-- um , for the acts .
and winnie the pooh ,
-- hurting .
-- when it 's just such a bad time for it .
-- should be able to do that , and be registered with what they ever contribute .
more to the point .
yeah .
if you really want it .
asia .
and lining the jaw up with the teeth .
-- at the same time .
-- dip into something like winnie the pooh ,
at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
-- the way they would pronounce words differently .
-- general business courses in high school .
-- and another thing that , uh , another reason why i chose that was the , the finances .
uh , a day , or several hours of the week . like a half of a day on saturday or something like that . in addition to what one does ,
um , things really seem a lot more flexible .
my heart was in my throat ,
deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant .
-- other things ,
health services as our primary care facility .
-- uh , one time that was in pittsburgh ,
-- i could n't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
-- i knew , you know ,
i wish that they would , you know , realize that they , they could n't make this kind of money ,
coming out at once .
because he had leukemia .
-- that we got mumblex
if you had done madam butterfly .
and , i , you know , nobody says because you 're supporting the troops that you 're , you 're supporting the war .
to me .
-- to see pretty much , uh , close up , you know , a lot of things that happen that people do n't see .
-- very very important .
but for now , we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and , uh , cold weather .
-- too , on , on like child abuse --
-- and , uh ,
big deal ,
-- uh , separate wastebaskets in our offices --
-- uh , some deer steaks --
-- i mean , look at the statistics ,
-- which , which we do .
something where you go and ,
these bugs ,
-- so , you see ,
-- just no possible way .
-- more up front --
-- and put it on the back and drove away with it .
-- but you just ,
and my second marriage .
-- is what you see down here .
-- nothing is perfect .
hours a week or five percent of their salary ,
-- for a dinner party ?
you know , like for , for the men that do n't have jobs ,
-- took it all off .
not all the time .
as far as , you know , even , even something as simple as staying up late , um , watching television late , um ,
the woods , that he 'd come in his little log boat down the river ,
out and about .
-- younger children .
things like that , and just kind of really got into it . like during the christmas season ,
-- i have to do .
uh , even if it 's like the peace corps where they do n't get most of it until they come home ,
-- you know , fancy budgets .
you know .
uh , our other animal ,
i had n't , uh , thought of it from that point of view before .
-- early in the evening .
-- you know , they really do n't have much of a chance --
and , uh , just travel whenever we can .
out here .
not , uh , an unknown little city .
if you left a purse on a subway , you would never see it again .
would not constitute , uh , dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might , uh , have set up for those who genuinely have a problem .
you know ,
life is to interesting to read fiction
-- instead of saying , well , i 'll just --
um , i think that that would be a real , a real , uh , advantage to , to her to have that and , uh ,
-- had everything
you see , i 'm from west texas .
organized battle between the two units was in texas ,
-- for paper .
-- you know , he ,
work
-- knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement ,
in , in the end he does n't throw her over ,
uh , and milk jugs and , uh , newspapers , you know ,
-- i 'm sure there are , you know , aspects to it --
-- though , and the , and the country on , like , the presidential .
-- after , after an oil change , you know .
-- and then , you think , well , how did they do it out in the real world anyway --
-- how to have out of body experiences and all that .
-- just not like basic news .
and have to do their own buying of things ,
-- you know , all their time to sort
-- or all children .
you know ,
-- for me , it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ,
-- i would like to a , a , assume that they 're going to do , do better this coming year ,
and just love her .
-- that 's the sort of system they have .
-- yeah ,
teaching .
-- it looks gorgeous .
-- that was about a month ago .
by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs .
-- one .
-- do have children to think about , you know .
-- bringing something for a potluck picnic
and know how bad off some people really are , and how good they 've got it ,
-- lo , lo , look for , uh , look for people to , uh , take care of me .
i 'm going to give it a try .
they , they have all their own activities
-- when they vote
and you 're hoping there is something that will cut down on that .
newspapers and , uh , glass .
in washington d c or washington state ?
-- by a day care --
-- extremes .
-- you 'd be more concerned with if there 's a type of care that it 's torture for them to lay down and take a nap .
-- uh , uh , history with them --
-- and pick that up .
-- in , in their lives .
-- and put it in their freezer ,
on a regular basis , not just christmas cards .
in politics ,
-- in interest .
seventy-seven --
you know , to , uh , to get out there and enjoy everything .
had themselves a ball for about an hour .
probably through the fall too . and , uh ,
-- going to have to do what that person says ,
churchill 's mother .
-- that educated on it .
-- in a s- , in a sense , the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries .
and served time at a penitentiary , uh ,
just child care ,
and having some peace and quiet
-- reading before they , i mean , not just --
without doing something to make this , you know , to keep , like you 're saying , to keep them still to make the staff happy .
that 's , that 's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips --
i do n't see much t v mostly when i 'm in school ,
just got a , i got a , th- , this one ,
it occurred to me ,
and it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store , will you take his sister somewhere ,
-- and , well , of course , another one of their mistakes , i think , is they have a tendency to change characters , or to change the characters ' , uh , uh , personalities --
-- uh , and including the out , uh , the outer perimeter type , uh , devices ,
because , uh , t v kind of ruined me ,
-- whatever ,
-- because , uh ,
you know , some of them , if they did n't have their addresses and all on them ,
-- which is fine .
-- real helpful , you know .
they have a loving home
do you have the basic plan or do you have the , the other one ?
for a long time .
and eat it .
say i do n't think i 'll come back here .
-- i would say .
uh-huh .
-- something like that ,
-- a pair of shoes
-- the soccer team .
-- up to , uh ,
-- way of getting the guns ,
-- wonderful activities that --
you know , because it 's , you know ,
-- because it , it had some , some meaning to me or something .
-- uh , person who 's going in and the family that 's going to be , uh , effec , effected by it --
my grandma speaking
-- our house , we , we 're renting it from an individual who bought it
-- you know ,
yeah ,
going oh , jeez .
-- that this is what is going to happen .
that
also .
i 'm envious of people that have the big boats
-- on that particular piece .
-- way back then , and fill it up .
-- like little cards and stuff .
it was written ,
i kind of get off on a tangent here .
i , the night before or that day , i will iron whatever it is that we need
that are usually in day care ,
-- grew .
-- will get him much further than say like a , a strong , um , business administration degree than with another m b a --
you know , we sit down and agree on kind of what , what sort of range we are going to --
in second grade ,
-- occasionally --
you know , while they do other things ,
it
-- half hour or so ,
-- as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things .
-- the decorative woodworking has just been a great , great help .
-- any of those either ,
-- that , that i ,
-- they have two great , uh , talk shows that go through everything that will grow here , which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are --
-- which is handy .
-- and everything
well , i agree with that ,
you know , that type of thing .
-- get out .
-- of the school system .
want to rob a bank ?
when , you know , these are perfect ,
going to end up .
well , it 's just an , an example .
-- they whooped up on them .
-- i have n't really been taking it out ,
-- being able to , you know , work when i want
-- um , college age --
-- something like that .
-- tend not to be registered .
-- go a different route .
-- there ,
-- on the other hand it makes it seem like ,
-- type of a system . um .
i think on the lines of ,
literally and figuratively .
-- when you 're p- , --
-- not only will they change the oil in ten minutes , and do a f , you know , as good a job as i can do , but they 'll , uh , lube , too .
episode ,
and words spelled wrong not marked as such .
-- something away from the discipline , i think .
-- you ca n't say it was wrong at the time .
-- or whatever you 're doing .
-- and so i , but i ,
wants to mumblex . .
uh , we have had sort of weekends like that too .
-- that i ca n't even touch .
i did n't even know that .
-- the judge takes care of all of that .
when my father worked there we , they used to travel quite a bit , all around you know ,
-- and that the , the very first episode of next generation , they had mccoy .
-- you know .
sorry i did not have ice cream to fall back on .
these days ,
-- on track teams and the like ,
ooh .
-- central time zone .
always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against .
just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and --
-- seemed to me like it was ,
till we do
system .
-- then you have to think about the taxpayers paying --
because of the timing ,
that is garbage bags , you know ,
-- to go beat up on people ,
and , and how many kids they have and how they break it up .
-- being anticrime ,
there 's nothing in it you do n't know .
dogs or
-- because they come in at --
-- fajitas now .
-- which helps .
just because it 's , uh , uh ,
you know --
and honey until it just ,
yeah .
-- and have served the sentence ,
-- about , uh ,
-- do n't think i 've read it .
-- on to you . ''
-- find the time for it on a given day
-- understand what happened , you know .
that 's good ,
-- um , magazines , an- , anything .
-- with you ,
-- and making all that money ,
uh , i did n't really find it to be a tearjerker .
-- if they could prove they 'd been here five years .
that was so , uh ,
or the next chuck norris type of guy .
on i b m p c
-- and talk to them about it .
and new jersey ,
students could watch that and , uh , criticize the methods used and , and analyze it . figure out what worked and what did n't work .
that 's quite a range .
-- it 's really sad because they 're not doing anything ,
when you walked into a store stuff like that ,
-- that my fa- , my husband 's father is really old .
well if you impose , uh ,
-- for dinner .
-- did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors
they are absolutely delicious
-- i guess it 's what they ,
-- or whatever .
we 're helping pay for there making these end products that are ,
that is what i know about the vietnam war .
-- do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it ?
-- the lens to the light .
-- the normal cushion that you have there .
-- uh , nursing ,
have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things ,
-- involved in all those things .
-- going to murder people no matter what --
just alive someplace .
-- stimulating environment .
-- um , is very expensive ,
i was really looking forward to summer , thinking oh , we are going to have some time off .
to take care of a problem before it grows big .
that if ,
what we consider street crimes .
before this knee business .
-- where they go and dump all this toxic stuff .
-- have to , as you get older you have to really think what can go , and what , to , to , to replace this thing .
-- i mean , you can only , how much do you wa ,
so they do n't deal with thirty seconds of an inch
-- it 's also ,
-- i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like , everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and , uh , you know , like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something .
some of that money has gone into the peace corps
-- all the lawn care ,
-- new jersey , you know ,
-- and then , like , my mom and dad , because there 's so many of us , and because of the way the laws are , you know , now , if we want to drive , we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars .
it 's harmful ,
you know .
he has a terrible weight problem .
thousands of cows , you know ,
he uses his speaker phone all the time ,
-- area every year .
-- i 'm going to , i 'm going to be , you know , driving a car for longer ,
-- testing firm ,
their income has slow ,
now that 's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor 's got a noisy dog .
-- and , and take it to task for it , because it 's not going to get solved , you know , if people are still trying , you know ,
-- the people that owned him should have been on the --
the southern history and the fact that this is a democratic state .
for sure .
so what gets you ?
real gun they do n't get back up .
-- would n't have the meat products in that
it should be interesting .
years of life .
-- so you ,
the ,
that are endangered or obsolete .
a parent , and that kind of thing , because ,
if , if they wait till later , they 've saved up some money ,
-- we do n't , we do n't take the newspaper to begin with . when , neither one of us are home t- , --
choices of somebody ,
-- there is just nothing else to look at
-- sleep , right .
after we moved away from germany , we moved to new hampshire .
because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities ,
with a more expensive college .
no one wants to spend a lot of money ,
-- and i place the call , this counts as your call .
-- have it be digested .
convincing you that you need to get on with it .
-- fortunately ,
-- right ,
is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it .
-- uh , a potato salad with olive oil , and uh , some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there .
-- has a , uh , a big paper mill .
-- report it
whether i wanted my kids and , you know , my , any of my family to come .
-- is the trend .
that , uh , yeah , that was a major change ,
-- it is ,
about it .
and , uh , but , you know , price and so forth ,
it 's like , say , a person using vitamins , as opposed to , uh , vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food .
you know , so just absolutely , you know , first class fly where i want to , rent a car if i want to .
that .
-- you know , remodeled .
so and doing all these studies and the things
-- get them with duals .
-- on his own people .
-- and loved it .
-- for doing that .
that adds to the fact ,
-- to develop the kinds of things that , that they 're going to need to interact with other people , i felt like i needed some strong influence there .
i think it 's a really good idea . and even if it is overseas .
-- because this is where my husband and i are both from .
-- to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework .
you know .
particularly in our area .
-- because it 's all in the computer , you know .
-- you have to be pretty , you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying --
um , because it 'll be that much easier for us ,
and his social security number .
because it was there in my hometown ,
norman , just ,
and pour the wine sauce over it as , like the last twenty minutes ,
because , um , to go out to frederick , i just jump on the interstate
like we do here .
you know , besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work
and violence too .
naval academy ?
of it .
-- and that 's why they put , you know , that 's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years ,
-- or animals or anything , you know --
-- would be a small , someone that i knew .
-- stay as long as you want .
in a shock situation without worrying about ,
and probably , perhaps ,
-- they were , you know , we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various , you know --
well you know we do n't have enough room left in the jails
we drink ice tea with every meal ,
uh , purdis creek .
-- sit down and read ,
-- it 's nice
-- in c d -s or whatever , it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever .
-- and a suit and , uh , all of that sort of thing ,
because it keeps going through the thing over and over again .
-- because they do n't have cleaning crews in most of those .
south padre .
books are pretty scary ,
they must have changed then . because it used , well
a lot of people realize .
tanks and all that .
and gene 's family was n't big ,
-- not pizza inn , but pizza to our house .
cars were scraping , ice off their cars this morning if they 've been sitting out all night .
-- three different levels of decking , because ,
do n't .
-- to hear about all the problems .
-- because typically these were close knit groups at one time ,
they 're , they 're getting there .
if the entertainment amount was gone --
you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem ,
-- floppy drive .
-- so , um ,
if they get some of those mega awards against them .
because they were n't in season ,
-- just recently .
at home .
-- and , and for the future generations , too . uh ,
-- you know , evidence of it in the newspapers and such , i mean --
-- because the limitation for reward is very severe --
when you get paid ,
that i still keep in touch with ,
-- you know , that kind of thing --
-- for older people who have money --
which is sort of like a deliberate bias .
for the recycling to children 's hospital , which i think is an excellent idea ,
-- which i 've never liked very much
-- if we 're not going lasagna .
-- in social situations sometimes ,
-- would candle them and package them is that , uh , in the fifties , uh , you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now .
-- really , the , th- , on the public t v , you know , macneil lehrer --
-- really amazing .
-- then they kind of get angry with her .
at least at the present time .
that you did n't have two parents at home at the same time .
-- with more stuff on it .
well actually they 're my husband 's pets .
notice it though .
-- the smaller now , and then graduate school later .
-- in the bay area .
all those exotic techniques , you know , getting --
in addition to all the technical stuff .
-- they 've had their ,
-- and the trees ,
-- we 'll talk to you later .
-- that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me ,
-- in the south .
-- after all these years
those doing the work , and those receiving the , the , uh , the services .
i mean , they , they get all these days off .
-- about anything .
-- the only year they played together on the dallas cowboys .
-- you know .
-- uh , i even had to worry about .
for a while .
-- you know , if i were smarter , i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest , which i do n't --
-- because we 've tilled them so much ,
-- that we can , uh , get some of the benefits of the , either the profit high times or , or in a sense , suffer during the low times
and not just taking the money but beating them half to death .
even in the , the , the lower , the lower schools .
-- the lot and , uh , had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications --
-- rules that it would take to administer it
some on recycling
-- idea that ,
-- who really knows what they 're talking about .
-- in vietnam .
-- the monotonous ,
just , you know , paper pushers like , like i am .
-- i guess we were about twenty-four .
-- really sensationalistic , you know , like what geraldo used to be .
-- that they 're going to call against this list of people who do n't want to be called .
-- uh , have my daughter and teach sunday school and go to school , myself ,
can you contrast the europeans and their vocalism on their rights to , to say the people in latin america .
-- for that .
-- so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems , you know ,
-- are going to have a baby in july .
-- and places like that around like arlington and fort worth and a lot of those grocery stores , they have like four different bins out front .
-- on my credit card .
not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job , but at least some of their time to look for , to go out and clean up the roads .
largely from friends
-- is n't it --
-- may not be true .
-- blood ,
-- you have won and all that .
-- the way , the way people dress
oh , yeah ,
that just require no programming .
-- fundamental change in the way we learn .
-- so to speak , as a family .
-- the great satan of the recycling .
and then use it then .
and , have our kids , uh , you know , have little lessons with them , and , you know , just see , count , see how things are going in our family and , you know , teach them about their grandparents or something like that . bring out pictures of them so they get to know them
uh , interviewing with three m .
uh , in , twenty years ago .
-- with him .
but get up during every commercial . and , things like that .
that they have in some other profession ,
-- would argue with that .
because i have so many ,
-- we do n't go hunting or anything like that .
-- twenty , twenty-two months .
i try to keep it pretty reasonable .
-- lots of vegetables ,
-- except air conditioning .
-- and , uh , as a nurse
-- he 's an indoor cat ,
-- they do a lot of things to themselves that , that we really do n't want our young people to be doing
were good little v eight engines that were not gas guzzlers
-- like that cause he 's , he goes to orchid shows and , and , you know , fills the car with plants . and so on
boston yuppie , you know ,
at like thirty thousand dollars ,
because i could tell by the theme of almost when it was written .
socialized medicines and things that ,
-- but encouraging each other to go .
just , uh , especially the weather .
-- fantastic pictures in those things . uh ,
-- i think sometimes they 'd prefer just to get it over with
if , and they 're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime .
-- i guess that was about a week and a half ago , it was just , it , it takes over the whole town .
-- you know
is is always the point of well it 's at conception
-- uh , because it 's something that , you know , we do n't talk about in this country probably enough .
-- sections to it
every year that ,
i 'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio , actually .
-- and , uh , pittosporum
we canoed up in arkansas at the buffalo river .
-- public ,
you know .
you know ,
-- it was ,
and get a lot of good recipes .
-- which is every other week .
in my last year , my senior year .
-- inner harbor .
basically stayed home .
-- that 's all right .
-- that 's about ,
-- that 's sad .
feel that , okay fine , if my bathing suit slips a little bit i do n't have to be conscious --
especially not after two years .
where are you ,
-- weather out there in georgia ?
i mean , absolutely outrageous ,
and just does n't even want to kiss me good-bye .
of the flake .
intricately
-- that he does .
and came in and remodeled the whole place .
-- do you know parker machine tool down there .
-- of the , um ,
and workout and then drive back .
-- to make chicken and rice .
uh , by the fact that we do n't sometimes watch our dress ,
you know , and big closet space , you know .
-- most of it is from cars .
uh-huh .
-- or people who do n't know how to deal with it .
-- kind of thing .
-- and that goes back in with your sulphur
-- ever since this big earth day thing came out , you know .
automatic seat belts that are attached to the door --
-- and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed --
too , if you ever come to , to dallas area .
something
i 'm working on my master 's degree now ,
you know , where he could n't talk about what he did , so .
that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show
acknowledgeable people .
-- by noon it was gone .
the kids are n't getting the attention that they need , or the television .
compare .
and family support ,
and never thought about it .
-- to , uh , take them off the streets ,
-- other page ,
and three brothers
and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped ,
worked about fifty-one hours a week , because i worked every , worked eleven hours every sunday .
either ,
i 'll have to go there when i get to --
i want blue and purple and , you know , just different shades of that . because my , my house is gray ,
-- what the circumstances were .
-- uh , going to these orchestra rehearsals and , and concerts and so forth .
uh , restaurant with the lions in the front ,
-- even back then
if you do n't eat any of those ,
lives .
of course , all the children are tested in some ,
-- they did n't .
go back to work ?
um , um .
i guess it made it a lot easier .
-- they 're not , you know , they do n't , they do n't have to be just completely cut off from , from the community --
we pay it off .
speaking of air pollution i 'm coughing mumblex .
especially like , uh , people who come from cultures that do n't have the same , uh , kind of moral upbringing that we have .
day .
foam containers anymore .
-- and see how it worked .
come home
-- go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month
because we 're both originally from this part of the country .
-- playing in the yard .
-- you know --
for road repairs .
i envy you your ninety-four degrees .
-- because i 've been down there --
than a few years .
sometime
the men are .
cheddar .
-- and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood --
i 'm a little familiar with the city area , forest lane and , you know , through that , off , off the freeway .
-- my son works for a computer company , the national institute of s- , s- , something ,
-- the same age then .
-- um , because my husband and i just do n't handle credit very well --
beach is nice ,
-- they have put plastic , plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows .
-- and , and go over there .
their relationship , uh , when i was able to work in the evenings , uh , really grew .
i mean , just pulling them as fast as you can .
-- with my sister --
your pan .
-- are probably the most important benefits .
the ones where they dub in , dub in the english .
--
before i went to work and stuff
-- are n't they ?
if , if i understand it right in places like the sudan and ,
says that it 's ,
because they say we do n't have the money to do it
-- during the day .
-- when they turned them in
um , and the luxuries of a large car .
very scotch
-- of course i 'm glad i did it .
-- you know , we 'll just have to wait and see whether that 's approved or not .
-- from , uh , eating at home .
-- the gym , because that 's very stressful to me ,
yeah ,
-- then they add the color .
-- i 'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the --
-- that is carrying a gun .
-- things like that .
and get rid of the american express because it costs so much .
from our daily routine .
in life learning and things .
-- and keystone .
i was going to say , i did n't ever watch moonlighting ,
-- you know ,
-- find ways around .
-- if i 'm not mistaken .
-- for kids , you know ,
at that time , as to the rush in the elementary .
-- and sing that again
-- because the farmers had cleared all the land --
and , and the right answer .
-- uh , particularly solicit , you know , soliciting .
plug in the phone to your computer and dial in
-- to do it .
she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted .
-- leave them alone .
the whole time .
and i 've bought , you know , i 've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper ,
had a half-life of , oh , five years if they sit empty on dry land .
if it 's something that i do n't throw away all the time .
you know ,
we 've always been at a place where we 'd have to go away for the summer or something
-- you know --
with a few other things .
-- than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money .
-- it 's a lot of trouble to , to take care of that .
-- respond .
sockets .
you know , for a wedding , for a wedding dress ,
-- come through town and everything
by the authorities do we step in ?
-- just research .
aside from , uh , having to , uh , take her to the hospital
-- through the screens ,
my name is fernando .
-- he does that every year .
-- i , i agree with you .
-- and so i 've have n't seemed to have gotten out as much ,
you know , chopped up dill pickles .
you know ,
we 're straying , i guess ,
uh , south padre is on down the bend --
i 'm not , as inter , you know ,
-- what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs ?
or trying to mistreat them or anything .
-- and working from there .
-- just to make enough money to pay the taxes .
to shoot up in that way .
because i , and i went out there one day and the plant was noth- , nothing left but a stem ,
so as long you 're listening .
-- to reserve that .
-- in that , other , uh , that i should do it --
you know , twenty , twenty , twenty-five miles per gallon or more .
-- you know --
which is ridiculous ,
the three eighty-six .
yeah .
not a fun thing to try to recover from .
you know , and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors .
because they , uh , california has such strict rules ,
and , and were interested in it .
in the taxing system .
-- once , once europe becomes unified and , uh , their economy becomes one big economy we 're going to be , uh , kind of hurting .
-- employee assistance programs that --
-- where they sleep that are , um , low to the ground
but not significant amounts , you know ,
-- and wo n't .
-- have a better one .
do you have anything else to say ?
uh ,
-- or for grouper
-- that deliver babies .
-- and i can never go over that or something --
-- the , the first time i had , you know , heard , uh , his views expressed by himself .
-- it 's a lot of fun , i think --
-- that you 're better off if you 're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours , it 's fine .
-- because i think my car ,
really good mexican restaurants
-- kind of been close to that .
took us to recycle .
yeah .
and they 'll eventually phase them out
-- the , the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be .
what i wear sometimes depends on , on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in --
for murder .
things like that .
got too ,
-- one of the major leaking sources of , uh , the , uh , freon .
-- that and school it 's not ,
stylish to do that at all .
was really happy to see that ,
-- against it .
-- with the situation .
i , it was just flag football too . i separated it again
ostracized by his family , uh , basically just , you know , uh , we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth .
and talk about it
and afterwards , decided that what i had gotten out of it just was n't worth the time i put in .
him into a more productive life .
-- where you just pay one price --
month .
-- being tossed in --
uh , system that kicks in ,
-- i have purple ones
the , the oldest ones .
go
i 'm very familiar ,
-- was quite good .
-- and they want to go home , and that one person 's got the car --
in this case .
-- not have to come back full-time .
it 's , it 's one of things where i 'm paid a little bit better then a history or an english professor
all over the place
a pop for patriot missiles .
in utah .
october . so that you know , your school district shines throughout the united states .
-- i do stuff with my kids , you know .
i do n't know what day we 'll stop .
well , see what they did was , okay , they , uh , they wrote to all the initial people , you know ,
-- when they 're just talking about , well , i 'm better than you , and blah , blah , blah .
no electricity , no sanitation ,
-- i ca n't go to sleep with the t v on .
-- what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and , uh , accurate decision .
when he sees it to his advantage .
or flex time or something that was a little more personal , you know .
-- surface materials on the pads is so good .
-- children in their own home .
quite by accident .
and central america .
-- and his master 's degree --
-- for two kids .
in the strictest sense of the , uh , word .
-- nice to have in your background , that , you know , then you can , you 're , you can be very flexible .
born on the fourth of july ,
-- job , you know .
radio .
with all the commercials --
-- i want it kept , it is hard .
you know , certain things that do n't bother us at all ,
-- you know
-- in prison .
of what you 're talking about ,
mean i thought for sure i 'd been raised properly
in that , in that time frame .
uh , the majority is , uh , married couple with children ,
a p c at the house would really take a lot of the load off .
everywhere . i mean there is n't any safe haven anymore for fish .
uh , you ca n't do this , get back , you know , or we 're going to force you .
for , uh , uh , a jewelry company .
-- you know , people that really have other peoples ' lives in their hands --
-- home computing .
-- uh , uh , although i do , uh , a lot of ,
-- that , that they do that
-- if you were a skier .
you know , in , back in the sixties , had a lot of alternative movements
that you 'd heard or that you owned an album of ,
-- in dallas .
because she was up here for a month or so , after i was
-- for work is , uh , this year , nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie ,
-- anybody who was old as that playing that well , you know , i just kind of had to go with them .
-- but i enjoy doing it more when i 've got other people with me .
currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here , in gun control avenues ,
and , uh , has pretty much dropped out of public life .
getting fun ,
-- have the same thing happen .
well that 's right .
i 'm willing to pay for that for my children .
-- i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less .
that every person , right after graduation from high school ,
-- a lot of people do it really the reverse --
-- we did plan it to where we have some , some play yard left over ,
-- a couple years ago --
and the times that it 's worked and the times that it has n't worked and ,
in the building .
with , uh , israel is a perfect example .
-- you know ,
sure ,
stayed in pretty good shape during school .
it was nice .
because you know they tear you to shreds , especially those rich --
-- and it 's all of like , she , she comes from a big family .
whereas , you know , here ,
the , the huge one .
those for a long time .
-- i just kind of think it 's going to eventually head that way .
-- starting to put metal detectors in ,
-- of a voluntary kind of thing
to the mesquite golf course .
-- from what was really a , a small town to a city .
-- would be terrible , as a teen .
we definitely see this , uh ,
two or three , you know , um .
-- to , to care about the , the situation with their child ,
there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they ca n't get anything done .
of doors
-- something else .
-- uh , you 're , you 're jeopardizing the future of the country , uh , for today .
-- for example .
-- going on there ,
awareness .
the ones that were starting to walk in one room .
man .
-- uh , to freedom .
-- been looking around and thinking about things .
-- you know , as you would a child .
and gas ,
you know , with , um , the u s funding israel and , and the , um , soviet union funding the arab countries .
-- describe first of all , the size school that you might be interested in --
kinds of things and any , any kind of violent assault , rape included ,
and , you know , all different kinds of things too ,
-- whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair --
with the bath water .
-- well , i do n't , i do n't especially recommend ,
uh , we do n't do much in the way of entertaining .
were in their l- , early thirties ,
and the idea that , that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space .
right .
-- rehabilitating became quite easy .
-- in any field , any sports .
at , at which one ?
-- after the baby comes .
-- for my children , rather than one that i have , uh , personal experience with .
-- hackers ,
needs them to be eliminated , uh ,
in the future it 's a
-- they could n't hurt me with their ten key or something ,
-- you know ,
minutes .
i wo n't do it .
you know .
-- going to be good and interesting for the kids . even , even cartoons , um --
do it quickly .
like if it , you know , was just an average , middle class car .
take that , you know ,
-- but they were , they were pretty touchy on it .
you know , because of external circumstances ,
so , i do n't know ,
-- uh , back seat let down into a double , i mean a queen size bed --
when you have one child now , that 's it , you know ,
-- and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know , too high .
-- now do you
look for those .
-- which was theft of --
the difference .
-- it 's going to be hard pressed to p , to put all your recyclables in that one --
-- i 'm still replacing that in the back , especially , under the trees --
-- when you , when you buy your paper .
and then go from there .
-- someone in the crowd would yell , hey , there 's john red eagle , you know
the money .
you know , it does n't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can .
-- of the summers and milder fall ,
which i support of course ,
uh , we lived close to both sets of grandparents
-- until we ca n't , we 've just lost control of , of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , you know .
overflow
-- you know , even if it was the , the , their , um , that summer right after high school --
for my situation .
-- then i do n't like you very much anymore .
it 's gotten bad in denver
-- uh , it 's hard to discern the bor- , what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical .
-- scout --
oh , i just got mine last week ,
-- for the last four years before i traded it for this
-- air bag , they may still be walking around .
-- the sulphur , yes .
i think it 's like seventy-five dollars for me --
-- using it .
almost that i find myself listening to , uh ,
from enid , oklahoma .
-- had a , a good program .
it 's , it 's just such a difficult thing .
-- we all ate there
profes- , in a practice almost .
-- public service
-- you know , for some time .
-- it is absolutely wonderful .
-- it has no credibility any more .
-- here at home under each of those names .
-- give blood or something like that .
-- when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at , uh , maceo high school --
i think all , i think the majority of people just do n't know .
lobster would .
-- to prevent , you know , so that , uh , the drug addicts --
for everything he puts in they 'll match it , up to a certain amount .
over the last few years .
-- maybe thirty of us on the boat .
business expenses and all those kind things .
and another one now that it 's getting darker
-- to , you know ,
are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage .
which would come out to be in thirteen months .
something with a , that 's not too sporty because of insurance , then
i mean someone in the process of rape ,
and a f , few grandchildren .
-- and , uh , make for more space that way .
somebody ,
-- get rid of him and not have to pay his contract .
getting money back on my , uh , from my , uh , withholding .
pour the basement and , uh , went from the ground up .
-- or , you know , even big executives --
especially when you got some , uh , jerk coming in .
well , uh , maybe it was the area i was in ,
particularly the local television . uh , i know the , the wednesday 's child bit
-- uh , you know , the guy only got five years .
because , up to this point i was in school so i 'd go home every summer
or better yet , down around saint petersburg , florida .
-- and , uh , get , they get donations from the community , you know , they 're real ,
-- ownership , i think .
and , um , uh , and , and , w- , a lot of the research shows that like , georgetown ,
um , when
you know ,
-- with it anymore
-- tang that would be good .
-- oh , you feel in a lot better shape --
-- a human hand ever touching it , you know --
you know ,
-- because that 's a lot of fun , especially this time of year where it 's so nice out .
-- it does not matter .
when she was in her late eighties ,
-- that 's right there .
-- six , eight , twelve hours away .
-- talking with you .
b t spray this ,
you know , things he would do with an airplane ,
-- primarily because of the economic distress .
-- join special forces , either one .
amount of cost savings .
and the minimum wage .
-- closer to downtown .
some mickey mouse type thing like that .
the original framers the ideals the original framers set down .
-- not too long ago .
-- which to me is , is good .
-- and laid back and stuff
you know from the power plants . um .
at the end
-- a good , good --
before i retired ,
but i disagree with that ,
-- barring traffic ,
-- most of the time .
-- is going to run for senator --
uh-huh .
-- in case , uh , they did n't put the oil in or whatever .
most of the other networks .
too late for t v .
to have fried chicken .
-- they ca n't do anything but work to try to pay them off .
-- a magazine that only talks about other , ex- , excerpts from the world press ,
as it were ,
-- are you saying that that way you 're not left stranded --
-- it ,
-- and , uh , lots of books on plants and , and , and gardens , because we started a garden --
can never afford it
that they would n't let them drink something or , you know , eat something off the floor ,
-- child use that bed --
-- little bit more than i want .
-- it 's very convenient on afternoons when i want to just get away and sit and think .
-- you know , few of the major ones , and then use them once in a while for something ,
done terrible things to them and killed them and , you know , that sort of thing ,
going on .
a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life .
and everything
it just is amazing , you know ,
-- uh , you know , if it 's a , a good brand ,
or if you 're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week .
-- namely lots of vacations --
know .
of the p- , person .
-- we did n't stop .
-- the last few years .
-- cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older .
i guess we 've spent our time .
and friends , that , um , i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with --
or race oriented rather than gender based ,
plant one of those
day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work ,
and , uh , he taught me how to shoot , uh , a old single shot twenty-two
a great big one .
-- in the clouds it is .
just look .
my m- , mother and dad use to , uh , own a restaurant ,
-- or my middle son , excuse me , fell in love with washington state --
-- the end of the month .
when i hear it that i like it .
-- you know , then i can , i look through them --
-- that was in just super condition .
-- uh , filters for air filtration stuff for --
-- type thing .
-- they test you too .
uh , i do n't know if it 's their proposal or one that 's being seriously kicked around .
from germany and finland , um , they are just , they have such a better , more mature , outlook on life
-- that read --
-- gosh , it 's nice , it 's nice to have someone come and wait the table .
need to use styrofoam plates .
-- my time actually .
okay ,
-- the cost was not near as much as the kindercares were going to be .
-- for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
-- so a mandatory drug test was done --
uh , we did have a little bit of rain yesterday .
uh , not really
uh , i do n't have a family ,
not even a half bath .
i do n't think so .
oh , not too much .
well , we , i do n't take , like time , or newsweek or anything like that ,
but i have n't been there .
oh , we try not to .
um , i do n't really think we have anything in the works as of yet .
we 're , we sold all that litter ,
uh , pittsburgh .
uh , not particularly
uh , i , i think they should , actually , although prob- , perhaps not a , an incredible amount more than what they 're doing ,
i , well , not here .
well , it 's the whole , it 's the whole city ,
i , i , actually i did n't go diving .
uh , i have n't seen any of the movies because i just barely , just like in the last year or so got interested in it ,
it is n't .
no i 'm --
it does n't have .
uh , not tons ,
uh , mine are both out of school .
well , not really .
hardly ever , unless there 's a hurricane or something like that .
not really .
i did n't go
well , as a matter of fact , i just bought one .
they do n't kill them ,

yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh ,
yes ,
uh-huh .
yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yes .
yeah ,
well , then i do n't know how much you 've been through it ,
you go where ? uh ,
like what for example .
well , what about random testing , though .
but i wonder how much longer they 're going to be a them .
but i 'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering .
so , when you say the morning news , or evening news or national news is when ?
your family 's from where ?
san diego ?
but you have friends that have children .
you say your , you go to school ?
even in utah .
uh , so you would take a position where somebody without , without a , uh , uh , specific use ,
uh , six thirty-five ?
so it is , yeah , and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother .
uh , in kenosha ? .
they go out a lot ?
so , so if , if william kennedy smith had been found guilty , you believe he should have been , uh , executed ?
i hope you visited during the winter .
i bet you 're mcdonald 's fan .
so i can wander around without ,
you all got a pay raise this year .
they want to see all the horror movies .
so ,
you have the seven day waiting period .
huh , you work for t i ?
not the harsh criminality ,
now these are long haired ?
in engineering ?
so , just , like in a thirteen by nine pan .
just massive rental .
i do n't know if you 've down to the sports for reunion arena .
does n't that sound stupid .
you must have a , a son .
that works all right then .
it must have , uh , what 's his name in it .
through your company ?
that , that 's that sears discovery card ,
hope it 's a good program there .
and you 're in minneapolis ,
i do n't know if you have one .
do they influence you a lot .
-- i do n't know if you 've ever read that --
well now that , is that , uh , that 's related to the , the aerobic , uh , mumblex ,
well , you should , you should have some opinions on that , then .
the color does n't really matter for , because you have that light .
i do n't know if you 're familiar with him --
but that helps a lot ,
you know , how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle .
and the handicapped group is getting the uh , the money
made all the decisions
usually .
well , if you 're ready , then uh ,
so y'all , you have n't had any , any jobs painted in your house or recently mumblex .
oh , you are in new york right now ?
but if you have talked about that in your classes , you know , in the last few years , i 'm sure that you have heard ,
with all the yard work and things like that .
do , do you like to do it wi- , with other people .
boy , he 's a big one .
oh , and pour that over it ?
you mean in terms of the economy
any more i do n't even know if they have , if a college kid would have a typewriter .
well , you realize why we were in the middle east . why we invaded iraq , why we were --
they went all the way down ?
nothing that you felt that , you know ,
but mumblex , you know --
threw it away .
so you do eat out a lot .
such as new york city ?
you had those poured --
now that 's for individual .
and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them .
it 's quite cold and --
i bet you used them all up over christmas .
they treat it with chemicals or something ?
which your income would be a lot better ,
i do n't know if you feel the same
oh , if you had it early .
and then defend it .
uh , oh , by fort sill there ?
well , maybe , uh , they just moved away and then sort of lost contact .
you did n't work at t i ?
you use the sneak- , system .
-- and , wonder if the insurance companies are fighting the national health ,
it 's still considered garland .
but . if you 're like me , you never have enough time for the hobbies .
you almost have ,
you have pets , i understand , a couple of them .
um , well , i real- , i , obviously you 've never had to look for a day care or anything .
nina and cliff ?
i , i will be compensated for this ,
no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for ?
well did you all catch it ,
like fabric that 's been stiffened .
so you , so you do n't hav , you do n't get anything off the gulf , uh , immediately from , from the ocean .
s- , s- , so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system .
well , you know , the little boy , the little one was trying to decide if there was a santa claus .
so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most --
the second lady ?
um . i wonder if these are going to be speaking . the computers ,
well , it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then .
with ,
that 's what you do on your , at least one of your machines --
bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake .
but i mean it does n't give you trouble ?
maybe you 've heard of a and m down here ,
you say have your four year old taking lessons already ?
that 's , uh , mumblex that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that .
long way down the road , right .
on just particular things
can you use it like at a bank machine
not in minnesota .
and i would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are , uh , a much better value down here ,
close to sea level ?
i mean like the , the jazzercise would be ?
i do n't know how long you 've been here .
by themselves i mean .
oh , you agree with schwartzkopf who says , uh , drive on into baghdad .
well you lived in france ,
and your wife 's folks still live in colorado ?
e d s is m- , is better than spring creek ?
actually , uh , you said you lived near , uh , baltimore ?
you 've learned a lot .
but you 're not living there right now .
i you say you take the newspaper .
they just fly right back out , if you have the ,
that 's possible .
yeah ,
well , that is one problem ,
you 're probably right .
the- , the- , they might .
probably ,
i think that may be .
yeah .
maybe so .
that might be true ,
looks like the george town brownstone .
that is the best one .
so you do quite a bit of traveling then .
catching tree bass ,
so , you got to make , uh ,
even though you uh physically you agree with me
it might kill you to go up and ,
getting a lot of breaks --
especially not a federal prison .
a little negative reinforcement there while you 're going .
the cat was here first
it 's here now ,
had no , had no teeth .
oh , by the time you get through with the , uh --
so you worked , you learned how to solve your problems on your own .
instead of being completely penned up .
-- so they have a toe hold ,
oh , so they do n't go to school .
did n't expect that would happen .
oh , so it 's worth taking them back .
it 's way too late ,
to another place ,
because you ,
and that would be it .
that 's like unconditional affection .
that we do n't get fixed .
so he would n't have gone to something like where we 're at , they 'd , in austin , texas , university of texas ,
so they 're , you know , mumblex
in other words you 're saying that , w- , you have to find out whether it 's premeditated or --
arlington area .
most of yours is kind of driving
well , it was a lot of money ,
oh , it 's still just a pup .
quicker --
so , you said you 're from mississippi ?
you say other things than sports , though .
survival becomes more of a priority than , than education ,
they 're pretty young .
our own hemisphere ,
um , so , you do n't , you do n't feel that , that we were , um , exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago .
apparently just , uh , re- , re- , uh , probably filled the , the brake fluid up
oh , oh , you mean you switched schools for the kids .
oh , your not ,
ooh , for those who are really cooperating .
like fishing and ...
but yet you can have your friends , uh ,
he may be retired .
oh , so he 's really into it .
he wanted new one ,
and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five .
so you 've got thousands of dollars or so .
saving them for you , uh .
deduct , yeah .
so , obviously though , do you think they 're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the super bowl this year
oh , thirty-five miles each way .
you mean instead of people
oh , in the elementary schools .
the bolts were , were eng- , were , were english then .
it sounds like you have a baby there .
that 's the hard part , right ?
you did it manually .
the humanities , the history , yeah ,
what is what ,
once you 're there , you 're all set though .
that 's critical , because she 's in need of it so often .
i could probably go half a pound .
you would like to know what they 're doing right .
that 's when they ,
he is gone .
pushing keys certain times and ,
because you do smoke one a day .
so , uh , as you indicated you do n't have too much input into the area
it 's whether the parent wants to take the risk .
melted , or just wet
unfair or something ,
so either you or your husband can be warm but not both .
and you 're coming out of it all right .
so you do that
and so it 's like they charge you for the deposit ,
if , if it 's on the credit card it does n't seem like it 's money out of your pocket .
oh , a entertainment type center ?
pork barrel politics .
or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be --
they only put part of it .
and now he sees ,
rather than --
oh the state does n't require it .
not like texas where everything comes to a stand still .
so now --
you feel like . .
what you thought , huh .
thank you .
well , thank you .

is that what it 's there too ?
well do you think it 's been five minutes yet
have you been , uh , have you been the subject of such a crime , such as stealing , or anything ?
have you ?
i do n't know how long we 're supposed to carry on a conversation , do you ?
is that with regard to work place engineering , or just , you know , environm- , the work place environment

um , the , the flip side to this is , are we getting what we 're paying for ,
have you ever seen those ?
i was going to say , do you just mix it to taste ?
are y'all planning on having kids ?
so you do spend less time then ?
have you seen it ?
do you think that there should be some control , uh , innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things .
and they do it that way ?
-- um , did you all ever think about purchasing that one , when it comes out ?
you want me to start off ?
and ,
is is just aerobics
did , did you play a , a strong role in helping them pick schools
did the iguana catch flies for you ?
huh . when you were , um , whe , when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too ?
are you married ?
there was n't anything like that , that you could do in florida ?
have you ever ,
an- , that 's how it is --
have you seen dancing with wolves ?
i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you , would n't it ?

do you ,

do you usually go out , uh , with the children or without them ?
i guess , uh , i do n't know what part of new jersey you 're in , but i guess it 's , uh , fairly industrial ?
or that you 've ,
well , that 's interesting , is n't it ,
so do you , do you fish mainly for trophies
do you work during the day ?
do you have a lawn ?
was n't it a murder mystery ?
um , do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one ?
okay ?
have you seen that ?
so , is , uh , is he working there then
um , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
who knows
so , i do n't know ,
i mean ,
so ,
and , and i think it was there in florida ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know what you would call it ,
well , i do n't know .
i mean , i do n't know ,
i do n't know .
well , listen ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
-- so , i do n't know ,
um , um , and i do n't think this would have anything to do with it ,
i do n't know ,
well , i do n't know . um , there 's , there 's a part of me that says that , you know , um , i 'm sort of glad strawberry went away .
i do n't know ,
i do n't know .
i ca n't remember .
i guess that 's not large compared to some ,
i do n't know ,
and i do n't know
i do n't know ,
mumblex i do not know ,
this might age me , date me here , uh ,
i do n't know .
and , and maybe this is too general ,
of course i think , um , i 'm not sure , you know , what the time span is ,
so , i do n't know .
well , i do n't know if i know anything or not ,
i do n't know ,
-- but , i do n't know ,
and , uh ,
and , so , i , i do n't know ,
-- i do n't know ,
but , uh , i do n't know ,
i guess .
i do n't know about education
but , um , you know , i do n't know .
i do n't know .
and , uh , i do n't know ,
but , i do n't know ,
i do n't know .
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
um , i do n't know ,
i 'm not really sure
but , i , i do n't know .
well , i do not know .
in some ways ,
at least that was , you know , that 's what everybody says .
i do n't know .
but i do n't know
and , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
but , uh , i do n't know .
but i , i do n't know ,
course , uh , i do n't know ,
i do n't know how much i know about this subject .
well , i do n't know .
i ca n't remember which .
or , uh , i do n't know , you know ,
and i do n't know which ones ,
i do n't know .
but , i do n't know ,
whatever they call them , you know .
and , so . i do n't know ,
and --
i do n't know .
i do n't know ,
i just wonde , i guess .
i do n't know .
i do n't know ,
uh , but , i , i do n't know .
but , i do n't know .
i do n't know ,
i , i do n't know .
huh , i do n't really know what to think about it ,
uh , that 's a hard one because we did that .
i , i , i do not know , uh ,
i do n't think .
trying to think of ,
and , i do n't know ,
uh , i do n't know ,
but you know , i have n't really heard much about that recently .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
i do n't know ,
i , i do n't know .
and i do n't know about your part of the country ,
so i do n't know ,
um , i do n't know .
but --
so i do n't know , uh ,
i think .
that 's only my opinion ,
you know , i 'm a funny duck
i do n't know ,
i do n't know .
i 'm , i 'm not sure .
i do n't know
it depends .
i do n't know ,
but , uh , i do n't know
i 'm not sure that 's the situation ,
i , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
but i do n't know
i have no idea ,
i do n't know .
well , i know , um ,
so , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
um , but i do n't know ,
oh , i do n't think it 's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and , mumblex , on an individual basis .
well , anyhow i guess we both agree that ,
wel- , everybody has to do , has to do something .
and , y- , the government 's going to be limited .
you probably have more there , though , i would imagine .
well , it 's just it 's something that anyone can watch and enjoy .
i think it 's a miracle we 're all still alive after so many generations ,
you probably do n't see that .
and they , they form it ,
if some people they have ,
the one that 's like you get additional ,
people can be paid off or politically --
and , uh --
and i 'll say , they 'll say , oh , well , our kids , my kid ,
somebody wants to do that ,
and , you know , they want , uh , privacy fences .
uh , that could , could be useful protection .
and life is a little slower , a little easier .
it 's not hard to find anything that 's part-time .
and now kids at sixteen years old , they have their birthday ,
that 's true ,
but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that , it does seem that we 've , we 've slipped and that 's eroded ,
there 's no reason ,
we 'd have to we 'd have to build less prisons , you know , less police force .
i know , that 's really neat .
so you usually are living where your parents live
you think about it
that 's a plus .
and those operating systems have to change
i think , i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say , you know , this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society
you can appeal it once .
i think it 's kind of absurd , you know , the fact that , you know , they do n't really , they do n't really give , you know , the original artist , or the original composer ,
uh , you know whether it was justified or not , i know , that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause .
-- and then , all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their --
i mean ,
that was , that was pretty good .
a woman congressman i 'm sure makes as much as a man congressman as , and the same as a senator or whatever .
and they 're not always the best person for the job .
and they --
so that , that would n't be too bad .
and i , i guess when you 're in a big metropolitan area like this ,
i do n't know if we 'll ever see that up there .
and i thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news .
well i think in large measure the reason they do n't care ,
really , i , i , i do n't think that 's a valid argument .
and ,
and i think those programs are really good for children .
so , you 're right ,
and then you never use the v c r ,
i mean , just like every other time that you look at it , the honda accords and the civics are right up there .
uh , they are tempting at times ,
but dinner parties are a lot of work , uh ,
oh i 'm sure it was wonderful .
but i know that it 's important ,
it might not be brand new
those are good products also .
-- and i think that 's happened in a lot of cases .
i mean , uh , at one point , at least on a local level , um , going into politics is , you know , what you 're doing is , is really trying to serve the community --
it 's awful ,
there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world --
um , sometimes i feel like i 'm in a singles bar .
you did n't gain anything from it .
of course , that period too was probably difficult .
stop trying to attack supply because , which , which to some extent makes sense and to some extent does n't .
they could not pitch .
but it 's running about seventy --
you have to be so precise .
and you realize it 's important that , uh ,
but that was very unseasonable for us down here .
and that 's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal --
people from california seem to be more health motivated all around . i mean , as far as the diet , and everything . uh , the diet and , uh , just your health consciousness ,
i , uh , i really think that , here in indiana at least we pay a , a whole , uh , just too much tax .
uh , it seems like there 's so much that goes to things that do n't really do a whole lot of good .
a lot of things do that .
i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last , uh , several years .
just because they 're grandparents .
i do n't think you , uh ,
i mean winters are kind of a problem
but if the time came , it 'd be real nervous .
you need that first ,
but i think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again .
that 's a , that 's a common problem though .
well , in part it 's , uh , it 's the nature of societies , perhaps more homogenous society , in many cases , uh ,
and , uh , uh , it 's supposed to have about the worst air pollution .
i 'm sure they are .
and it , it , it is really good .
but , uh , so far as getting out there and , and putting it on , it only takes a litt- , a few minutes , uh .
if they could be up and doing some things --
-- and you can just relax , and --
uh , probably the biggest thing we 've got going now is the robberies
this may be unfair to mexico ,
well i guess this , the weather is n't as lively a topic as , uh , as some of the others we might have gotten .
and , you know , there are reason to look for another job --
you know , one thing you might do with , in a situation like that , though , it 's just like keep ,
i feel that my , uh ,
i was kind of boring .
as long as you have so many diverse groups that are , that are vying for power , it 's going to happen all the time .
it 's just hispanics here instead of blacks .
of course , now fifty percent divorces in the united states , uh ,
-- no loopholes or anything .
that is the hardest part probably .
but there 's something like about eighty six billion that they admit .
i think we should have stayed longer .
oh , it 's a , uh , it 's a question of your , your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response .
that would be fun .
well it should be an interesting year .
but , i think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted , you know ,
but it 'll save in some areas ,
i- , it 's like , it 's like a kid .
but i think they 're actually supposed to ,
this is the university that has , for years had the , the car , that , uh , will travel the farthest on , uh , on a small quantity of gas ,
and if you were trying to follow any type of , uh , plot , it , it total- ,
but i agree , you know , the , uh , medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the , uh , security aspect for long term employment , uh ,
but unfortunately they think if it says b m w on it that you have money .
it 's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to , to weave the , the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand .
and some is they 're more educated than they used to be i think .
it helps mature them a little bit , and helps them understand the world , the way it really is .
that 's not so bad ,
and --
like you said , if you really , if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff ,
they , uh , they 're , nobody likes them in that part of the world
like if they 're on tr- , uh , trial for rape , you ca n't have any , you ca n't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff , or whatever .
and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off , off your income tax --
but it 's that you are there when they need you .
that was really good .
uh , i wish the government would operate on the same premise that , uh , businesses operate on
and until we , until we start changing our educational system , i mean we 're , we 're going to be ,
and so the guy might get off .
and kids --
and speaking , speaking of doing what you want , uh , just in society today being that it 's nineteen ninety-one ,
but they , they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates .
their style of play was so much different from --
you 're not going to react that quickly .
so you 'll be cool all year around ,
well , i think we 're on , maybe .
and it 's really interesting .
and that might be a partial solution ,
it 's , i mean , not just exercise , but anything .
i think they get a lot of people in trouble .
and that one was .
so it 's kind of an interesting situation .
and it 's kind of dangerous .
-- and , uh , if i consider going the used car route and save up some money , i should n't have too much trouble at all .
if i am an expert in it , they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think i 'm not expert in it .
it did .
um . that 's interesting .
but , i think the u s is one of the few countries that still do .
-- they could just go off the deep end --
most are n't .
-- and i , i feel that the , the only legitimate paper , although it might sound ,
that --
and it 's surprising how much --
people still think we 're about ,
but , you have to have loyalty ,
however , i have been persuaded , lately , i guess , simply by the , uh , overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime .
i mean , if you 've read one , i mean it 's ,
her disposition 's gone downhill .
but --
and there 's a notion of fairness .
but , i guess , you know ,
that 's not a bad idea
we just put our goals in different , you know , levels is
though , i live in , you know , the real richy part , i guess .
we 've got kids twenty years old , right now , that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications .
uh , my job is government tooling specialist .
i , i feel like that child molestation and murder
and i think that 's good for the strength of the united nations .
but , you know , those kind of things i 'd like to know --
and tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list .
so . that 's , um , a really good party time ,
and uh , i think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things , too .
and the kids just love him .
if it 's paper it will probably shred .
uh , it says a lot about , uh , uh , you know ,
send it to this address ,
and so , uh , the likelihood that , you know , maybe expected , expected murders by him is , is , uh , integrated over the income of the people , uh , that he murders is maybe , you know , a loss of , who knows , eight hundred thousand dollars .
it just , it just does n't do anything .
well , i think that , uh , you have an excellent deal then ,
-- and so , uh , it , people , they , you know ,
it 's going to have to be both .
well any , any advantage that they can take .
well , you get a much bigger , better --
you know , that 's good sometimes because you need to , you know , get away .
and i would definitely get my money 's worth , uh , much better than state .
well , i think that should be , that , that 's a , another problem ,
also saves a lot of time with commercials .
and i , i , i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment .
they 're going to go somewhere pretty shortly .
but that 's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time , .
well you must have a , just one hero ace professional job to support something like that .
and the trouble is , you do n't , you have so little input about it .
-- and , it sounds like they 're going to , you know , they 're ,
and probably the only way that can happen is for , um , governments to realize that they have to pay if companies do n't .
but i 'm just afraid it 's going , it 's going ,
and they do n't care ,
they tend to tighten up whenever , whenever you have to do something --
that 's why .
but i mean i do n't think you should just not listen to advice , even if you do n't take it , just listen .
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls , a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls .
we ca n't , we ca n't balance a checkbook without a calculator .
they 're , they , they got a big thing because of the , you know , the , the expansion going on in baseball .
i think we both agree on that , then , then , then , then a parent ,
rather than just little fish .
and i do not think a lot of parents ,
i do n't know if it was just the .
i mean , i mean , it 's almost four hundred ,
ca n't never get out of debt .
but , yet , the , the government that 's in moscow told its army to go in there and get those people
that sounds good if you were short on time , you could get a summary real quick .
you know , when they answer the company , i think it 'll make it a lot easier --
but there are times when a child needs to be spanked .
and it 's just a big mess .
i mean it 's , it 's a nice , that 's a nice place , though .
but , it 's going to tax you physically .
well , and even , even that i do n't really know if that would help .
you 're young .
maybe --
it 's , it 's interesting .
but i know we have n't cured it yet by a long shot .
and now they 're , uh , really playing as a , good together as a team .
and maybe they just do n't report those
i , i find that an interesting element of politics that we do n't , that , that most people would not know that john wiley price apparently is a , is a , you know ,
you know , and the japanese and the germans and everybody else make experts by doing .
-- i guess in the ice age , it , it , it 's pushed a lot of , uh , limestone and everything ,
um , people start paying attention to you very much
it sounds like mister power hungry .
so , i 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh ,
i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that , i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder .
and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult . uh .
but on the other hand , maybe that 's ,
oh , so it 'll go up .
-- um , a a real intense burglar can just get another dog that 's in heat .
now impact is kind of bad too , though .
i think --
i suppose the whole country , or the whole , um , new state would require such aid .
well , what you got is the situation wherein , uh , if you ever get in trouble , you want to hire the smartest , crookedest , lawyer you can find .
and i said , well , you 're not going to have to type on the computer one day ,
so we 're footing the bill on our taxes .
and --
and i ,
i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches , you know .
i think so .
your occupation has nothing to do with it .
and this is out in california where , where they do n't make a car that 's got reasonable performance anymore .
but if you let them , yeah . if you let them in a million at a time , it would n't make that , you know , it would n't make that big a bulge in the population . but --
and two years later he remembers that .
i think that 's really the only fair way to do it .
though , uh , one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony , had a long criminal record and had been , you know , a real sleaze bag .
go somewhere really nice , like hawaii , and just --
it , uh , really is very , very interesting .
well , that 's an interesting thought because ,
just to , um , think that way , we have to be in that thought pattern and able to , um , motivate ourselves to , um , uh , do what is right for the atmosphere .
kids do n't , kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk
i think that we 're probably going to see a lot more companies , uh , run by females .
but , he 's , uh , he certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids .
um , i 'm not sure what else that , uh , we could address , uh , on health care , uh , other than the fact , i think , uh , the eyes and the ears and the , uh , whole self should be , uh , uh , included in all of that .
but , i mean , and no one will , will go a step further to remove the english signs .
-- or just to face the children different directions or to do something --
they do n't have the offense to , uh , to get out , or to have the , the more runs ,
-- then i think it , it is hard .
and then to have to deal with sexual abuse --
it will be interesting to see how well that works
-- and it 's kind of nice to , to have that .
i 'm not into watching sports .
the metric system was still not ,
but , but supposedly once you have an office in d c , or , you know , and , and staff it with people , it 's really tough to close it down
that would be real good .
and i think it gets them prepared to , to learn how to volunteer as they get older .
the stationary bike is , is so , uh ,
and we need expert cooperation .
it 's really hard too ,
it was , it was such a rout though , you know .
but the guy at the very top , the one who 's , who 's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure , uh , the , uh , and had the political --
and it 's , there 's nothing harder than that .
military service is not that much
but i think that also ,
well , it 's kind of same for me ,
if i had all the money i wanted , then that 's whole different matter .
you know , how can you watch that , you know --
but , uh , you know , you can improve your own soil there --
but there should be with our overworked , uh , judicial system ,
if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor --
and , and then you , and then it 's not a choice anymore .
then as times changed , uh , as it is today , we do not do a lot of physical labor ,
and i think the , the main thing is , like you say , it 's a , it 's a good out .
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad .
supply and demand .
and i guess every ten years it 's just been very different .
and if you could show that ,
and , uh , because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot .
it requires a lot of effort to , to ,
and , he has done a really good job of characterizing the , uh , disabled person .
and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us .
he wanted to go out a winner though .
but it is , it does seem to be a big problem , you know .
uh , but on the other hand , you know , uh , like i say , i kind of , kind of against government control in general .
oh , no ,
that would be fair .
they sit there
and that 'll keep them busy enough so that they wo n't have as much influence .
unless they say , well , look , unless they walk in , they could walk in and say , look , i did do drugs a year ago ,
i think that a jury should listen to the courts , uh , to , to the hearings and to everything ,
but something has to happen ,
well , it 's interesting , uh , that , uh ,
so , i think it is probably better to have some sort of a , a , at least a record
-- although during , during the presidential debates , there was some really nasty patronizing ,
you know , i mean they 're not the , the typical country where they 're just , you know , my wife left me , my dog left me , you know .
oh , i think the , the sales tax , they just got to do something about it .
and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes having an educated populace and then --
and also , i agree with that
uh , i did n't think that was a new revelation .
you 've got to have the flexibility that does n't really go with the family .
i mean , it seems like that , that would be an okay life just to hang out
or they get ,
i mean , it just seems ,
but then again they have to live in that environment .
well , you ca n't afford to .
oh , i think a lot of people are .
the , the saltwater fish have so much more color
for the fut- , well , yeah .
you charge this for twenty , charge that for twenty , charge this for twenty ,
cause , because it is neat .
the fact that they take our money and do n't do what we think is right makes them thieves .
-- you know , jody foster was good , too , but i think , i think anthony perkins was the one that , that really made the movie ,
then , in , in the case of airlines , of course , they became highly competitive
and i do .
a lot of people try to stay away from this
i mean , sure , their life is taken ,
and either they 're in there ,
i , i do n't understand it either , although i , i think a lot of south americans regard the united states as , as bullying .
and ,
if your child is old enough ,
and , uh , by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time ,
but , um , there 's no , never anything good on saturdays , though .
i mean , we ca n't say it does n't , because it does happen .
it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones ,
and i think that , uh , i think by the year two thousand it , we 're going to see some , a lot more changes , uh , hopefully , that women are , you know , able to get the , the executive jobs ,
well i used to hate star trek .
and they find out , well , this dump does n't work
well , of course , by the time it gets up here it may ru , run into a cold front coming down from canada .
and there 's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de- , the defense area but manufacturing in general .
i mean , think , the , he , this chain that must have been on president bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground ,
uh , that 's a good question .
mumblex you know , those old movies seemed to have had something --
and , uh , unless you do something like that , y- , you 're going to get sick .
and the , the care that they are getting , the people who are giving it are pro- , are paid at a minimum wage ,
i think a lot of these people do it , uh , mainly because of , of t v
-- but , uh , uh , i think it 's not as much as it was .
i think if we wait , uh , which is happening until somebody says we have to do it --
and they get away with it ,
ooh , well that does n't leave a lot of time for hobbies ,
because , um , there are , there must be people like you , or in other circumstances , that could come up with , with , uh , false positives for certain kind of drugs .
and you realize that you 're not buying anything on sale you 're paying , so much more for that item , because you 've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what , forty dollars sometimes just to have the card .
i 'd be just fine without them , because , you know , kids come running out wanting to beat each other up .
he was fortunate .
but you better figure on multiplying that time out , about by at least by five or so .
i mean --
you got four oh one k plans .
because it is really taking over ,
i mean it 's , that 's very complicated .
so until i see the entire , quote , old guard of the soviet military , of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear , preferably buried , i still consider them a threat .
it was a pretty good movie .
and that 's always something that , you know , you just do n't real , you do n't think about .
you do n't just make the dinner ,
but , and i want to see them win , because you know , damn it , they , the fans deserve it .
and , uh , granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged ,
it was a lot of fun .
that will be easy .
it 's really funny ,
well , we definitely need a change in the system
but at the same time i , i agree .
now , something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the arab , uh , uh , their version or vision or whatever the united states , now , is somewhat changed in that we won , you know .
so that makes sense ,
i think that 's actually good idea .
and it seems to me that mo- , money could be more well , well spent somewhere else .
that 's a long time .
but they always please the money people too .
i mean , because that would definitely look like another korea ,
when you are home --
i mean , it 's still ,
to get him out of that , uh , uh , criminal mind that he has and to direct ,
but it seems like ,
even if you took speed reading . huh .
you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete , uh ,
now i , i do think the government , though , is going to have to do something , uh , with this problem , because , it , you know , even to go to a little doctor out here , just to ask him anything , costs you forty bucks --
that 's , that 's unbelievable for that size of car .
but , uh , now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of , you know , taxes on everything they buy , and where people that make , you know , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that , they are n't going to be paying taxes on , you know .
so after buying the filter and all the oil , you 're looking at ten bucks at least ,
and different circumstances call for different things .
for example , like the cosby show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time ,
and , you know , we 've got the power .
but it 's so expensive , man .
but it almost does n't look like it 's almost livable
but it 's amazing , you know ,
and , uh , i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to , uh , teach the people , uh , uh , everyone , uh , more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting .
it 's really , really pretty .
and in the , the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again
they , they did more things together .
but , uh , the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you do n't really want .
i think we ran out of social ,
that 's all you really need for a lot of , lot of pop .
it is out of necessity
and that 's practically impossible to do now a days , for a company to ,
i mean , i , i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something ,
so --
you ca n't do anything .
they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle , and what can you recycle and what you ca n't .
i think that 's a lot more realistic .
which could be , you know , part- , partially cultural anyway .
and i think there 's a lot of , um , kind of myths that we 've come a long way just in terms of our society ,
the bigger --
they said , i think the tape said something about changing , uh , changing it such that the ,
and then they look back .
you can not ,
and , and , uh , i 'd , i 'd really like to see stability in that area , because i 'm always afraid that 's where another big war is going to start . not that desert storm was a small one .
man , i mean , it gets pretty mundane ,
that 's right .
and sometimes .
well smoking ages you quick ,
well , they need a schedule i think .
well , you know , in a lot of cases like that , where , you know , if kids are going to a public parochial school like that , it 's , it 's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education . it shows , i think it shows that the parents have some , uh , desire for , for the kid to do , do well , you know ,
and , but , but the , uh , uh , i , i really feel as though the interdiction effort is , is ,
and , and you could have them around long enough
and we 're all heading that way
and it will , if have you a thirty year note , it will take like seven or plus years off of your note .
you do n't have the right to interfere in somebody 's life .
and it seems to me that it 's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections --
well , it sounds like they 're doing quite a bit .
and now we have , now we have several , you know , we have to worry about aids
they put a lot more emphasis on athletics
so that 's , that 's not as bad .
so there 's the potential that perhaps , you know , the u s budget might want to take a look at it 's , uh , federal employees or , and take a look at saying , well , let 's freeze wages .
and there 's just so much military machine there .
oh , well , you 're doing , you 're doing just fine ,
well , when you take a , a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class , excuse me ,
that 's a good idea .
well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that .
we just keep breeding them .
they wo n't be able to pay .
there are a lot of nice places ,
kind of hard to do gradually .
but , but they 're protected in so many ways without having to , to pay for the rights and privileges .
so there 's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we 're running ,
i think so .
uh , and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure .
i 'm probably older than you ,
and you can spot them ,
but , but the problem is , is that we , we only have but so much room
and then we further --
best training in the world is not going to f- , put food on your table .
those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty , which i think is a little too limited .
and , you know , when you die , it 's like , when they die it 's more like an investment .
you know they ca n't get out and see anyone
years ago , you thought , well , these little small cities and all , would n't have that problem ,
uh , i , you know , i think to a certain degree , the reason that it , it does n't serve as a deterrent , uh , may be because y- , you never know if it 's going to be a , applied . right ,
i mean it 's not the judge 's fault i do n't think .
and maybe the air force academy is a perfect ,
and , you know , we need to solve these international problems
people were just as violent before t v was invented , maybe even more so .
but she was probably depressed to begin with .
um , it 's a little bit like junk mail but except you ca n't , you know , ignore it , uh , quite as easily .
you better have some other way of , uh , savings ,
uh , the , the attitude of the staff as you said is really --
and i just , i just see that dwindling in , in ,
i think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not .
with so many options now available , you know , where , where cars are concerned , it just seems like there is , there 's almost too much of a choice anymore .
i would tend , myself , to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a , anytime a , one of the parties wants one .
and it 's just , it 's just goofy .
i do n't think there were , uh ,
and what have you and giving you traction .
well , it takes a little brainwashing first .
i mean , the ,
well , that 's exactly what happens in government all the time .
and he 'll be so far off the wall that they 'll elect him .
so , i do n't think , i do n't think there will be too much problem
and then , of course , one thing i think , too , is with tele- ,
and , but the particular seems to be the , uh , the quiet ride .
just , just getting there , is , has to be half the fun .
in fact , it really was to begin with .
it 's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher .
they do n't have that much money on hand ,
well , that 's an interesting channel .
well , i guess in cases like that , you know , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again --
we can handle it
and , uh , they do n't --
get the kids --
i mean they 're anxious for someone to be killed .
years ago it would have been fine
and they do n't follow it at all , you know .
but that that 's really like an all time classic .
i think when we do it ourselves ,
li , little things like that , that really start to aggravate you .
it 's fun .
they 're just not made to do that type of thing --
and some of the other stuff that , um , i think that changed it , you , uh , when i first got out of college fifteen years ago , they were always saying well , if you , if you were assertive you were a libber ,
so --
absolutely pathetic .
i think that could be true too .
so , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it 's really being used today ,
if you make forty million dollars , uh , then you 're going to pay four million .
and then he sprays his yard ,
i , i think that you 're absolutely right there .
well , first , they always say , get to know your country first before you leave ,
and ,
but , but other than that i think it 's , it 's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and , you know , like the , uh , shelters and , uh , , that kind of , thing ,
automobiles of course are contributing , too ,
well , i guess , in one sense we felt that , it , it 's nice to have a dog even though there are , you know , complications come with it .
but it , it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax , uh , on top of it .
it , it takes their minds off of , of trying to compete .
well , you know what the average person ,
so maybe , that 's like the extreme of it .
because people have to vote in different areas
you sure do .
and this would have to come rather quickly , and would have to come originally also where we 're not paying ,
they could very well
but i think , um , that i , that that 's probably one of the biggest difficulties , uh ,
i think that 's the worst part .
i , i feel that everyone is , everyone is , uh , entitled to a trial by jury .
but , um , some of these people are just out and out brutal .
i mean , it 's kind of like the aids phenomenon , you know ,
well , people tend to --
i mean , if , if you 're talking about any- , if you 're talking about something that 's like a full time , you know , one year full time , you know , this is what you do , you know .
they 'd be ready to vote .
they 'll never get caught .
they look tacky a lot
that 's even better .
-- that , there is , uh , local news that , uh , that really a lot of times does n't , does n't change , change my life one way or the other .
well we 're really overburdened from federal , state and local ,
i might consider it the next time ,
so it 's , it may be an idea to think about , you know , cost .
the , the , the idea of what you need to , to exist is so outrageous that it 's not --
and , and you 're right ,
in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the united states .
but i think your mayor ,
you know , wh , when you consider , you know , it 's probably not radioactive
i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible , wherever they were going , maybe they 'd think twice about doing it .
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something , because those drive you crazy , if you 're , if you 're in the room .
so then i 'm , uh , uh , probably a poor example , although , you know , i was an administrator and could still be i suppose .
i think they did a great job .
uh , cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget . not only for buying them , but for keeping them on the road too .
unfortunately , a lot of times it , responsibilities like that seem to fall to , you know , maybe one child in the whole family , you know .
it 's just a give away .
but i think it 's an issue that , you know ,
and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available , because they 're in on the know , you know .
anything that they 've earned while they 're in prison should go back to the state except for that , you know , there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with .
in some cases we do pay more , for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment .
uh , really , really good .
uh , when i think of crime , i think of stuff that , that affects other people like people getting , you know , killed or raped .
and then you start making a movie and it has no , there 's no call for something violent ,
and if they were in the same building --
well , i , i think we kind of are along the same lines .
-- but the qua- , but actually have a truer standard of living .
with , with other things going on , it , it seems to have lessened ,
then , you know , it could , uh , it could lead to some serious things .
i mean , and it 's nice to , to try to teach young people some , some , uh , uh , civil , uh , consciousness , but forcing them to , to donate basically their time and efforts ,
but it seems like there 's a lack of honesty in , in foreign policy a lot of the times .
and i think that 's good because it does allow people to be individual
in fact , i think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession .
and , and yet we ca n't to that either .
i think he is ,
this , you buy what you can afford .
-- and , uh , and if you get that you can ,
because i guess , i guess i feel like if they 're on a diet like that , i 'm going to , you know , honor that ,
well , i would say the saints after ,
and you know that 's why ,
and you think that ca n't possibly be done ,
and nothing happens .
i used to use a , just an apple two e , which of course is --
those are real popular ,
um , so i suspect that that 's one thing that , that as individuals , we can do , make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators .
so --
that 's probably where you 've used it .
and , you know , i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore .
i know there 's not any food that you can get ,
and it seems a lot of times that , uh , especially in criminals that , their rights are so protected
and so , i think , you know , before the father would work
it 's a good time for gardening .
they love violent leaders , to , you know ,
it 's good to cover all the bases there .
people need to take groups of children ,
because they get involved in things so young that they do n't really ,
you know , it 's a different viewpoint .
and , you know , there 's a lot of , number of
it 's funny .
well , and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change .
have them do a little bit of the sorting .
-- that 's true .
i 'm sure the indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of dallas ,
well , you know , you know , you know , what 's always good is sort of a for savings , where they just take money out of you 're pay .
if everybody tries to do just a little bit , and a little bit more then --
i mean , i , i can see that research is needed
uh , one man can never be , one man , one woman can never be objectionable in every case .
you know it 's , it 's interesting that , that a lot , the population of the united states is changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time .
before i got the answering machine , it was ridiculous --
well , with all the , uh , central expressway , uh ,
i mean like i say , we 've come a long way , but we have , i mean , twice as far to go ,
-- and , i mean it was fantastic ,
i think you start out with the criteria of , you know , do i know of anything
-- but they never say who , who they 're really working for or what , you know , what --
i mean i just think that 's human nature that you 're going to have corruption in government , in business , personal life , i mean , you know .
i mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much --
maybe not as much as now
well , i think that people should be allowed to have them .
and i think , that 's how you have to go into something like that .
to some extent the public schools , or the schools in general ,
and they have so much more personality than a dog .
i realize that . i mean , to go to these movies and expect them to be , you know , other than just , just good entertainment --
well , i guess we 've talked as much as we need to on the subject .
um , uh , before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like , uh , black people , or , you know , just large , large groups of people ,
but like what i was saying about the social security , that 's real , you know ,
-- and at least , you know , financially in the short run ,
the problem is you always have to wait until they 're out .
uh , the short term , the recession is getting , getting top attention .
unfortunately the rangers do n't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do .
but once you get , if you , once you get something fancy , you get stuck somewhere off of the main area --
we think of ourselves as the only americans , when they 're americans , too .
-- they kept doing , they kept putting off doing that .
it really impressed me , just you know , feeling
um , the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and ,
but when you se- , when you get up in the morning in , in dallas and , and see all that haze from west texas ,
i , i do n't think anything will ever take over the n f l .
and you have a country and western song --
these cars , i guess they figure all the old cars , will be off the roads or something by the , in ten years --
but they 'd need , they 'd seem to be ticking off faster , too .
i think maybe those people that really do need to work , both parents , just to survive .
um , i think , uh , the biggest limitation is a lot , just time and money , is n't it .
and then , you know , i mean , even at that you have to consider the logistics of it .
that was a pain .
well , i think they should , they should limit the senate to one term , one six year term .
probably , you probably got everybody on you , because they were probably all going to law school .
and there really are criminals that are hard-core and ,
of course , the longer you keep it beyond that point , the more profitable it is to own it yourself .
so it 's hard to compare .
and it 's the wedding season , i guess .
it is , it is , it is , uh , interesting , uh , with the computer to read the computer news and ,
but i think the jury should be able to recommend ,
sucking the head
but whether it be the , your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun .
but , you know , critically acclaimed .
education is a big thing --
so , you know , if you weight everyone equally , then you have to say , well the likelihood of not terminating him ,
that 's ,
they end up being , becoming divisive themselves .
but it 's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself .
and i , i do n't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house .
and if they 're , you know , if they 're on some kind of , you know , contol , controlled substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who is able to evaluate them .
and the first kind of invasion of , the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me , and very much everyday in this country ,
i mean it , it 's nice for people buying homes
i guess it 's kind of like , kind of like cigarette smoking , you know .
they 're really comfortable .
if you take it up the next day it should be fine .
mumblex help a lot .
-- you , you miss that .
although they do n't actually e , execute it themselves , it 's really the government that mumblex .
they wanted to be like men ,
a lot , uh , a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the , um , general public wants ,
i mean , they do things that they need that .
but ,
but i think that 's probably a good idea .
but because there 's no strings attached , it like gives them a freedom to give us something back .
it 's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly , uh ,
i mean i think sometimes some of the , the women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know ,
it 's , it 's too bad
well , what i believe is one of the major pro- , uh , things that is wrong with our public school system is that , um , we do not have enough discipline --
and , another thing i think has changed quite a bit is , uh , the roles that men and women play .
and , uh , i , i think it 's gotten , uh , very different .
and what they done is they 've bought this congressman for two years .
they , they adjust to what the parents mumblex .
you go out and get in that real cold car --
that would be neat .
now , that 's a thought .
but there 's a sense of ho- , i guess , purity in the show ,
but it 's not enough , you know .
that 'd be pretty hairy .
you think , you know , for a stephen , you know , it because it was by stephen king it would be really gory
well , i think it 's inevitable that we are going to see national health care
um , as far as the system as a whole , i really do n't see a problem with it .
well , there , well supposedly ,
gorbachev has made his attempt
uh , a- , like i said , as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence , that 's absurd .
and ,
we got ripped off buying our new car .
the key thing that i think , that we try to do , is that bring all the friends over here .
i think parents are definitely , uh , spending more and more time .
him just standing there .
and as far as like them , uh , entertaining the rights that they should have .
i did too .
those are cool .
not my favorite place , but .
and really society sort of dictates that , uh , you know , both the parents work .
even if it 's five bucks , even .
and i think that is happening more and more .
and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas us , we write a check .
i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children , because we would do away with so much of the burn-out that we have .
and because of that , these quote , unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder .
no matter who they are
you probably have to buy that from specialty stores .
but there 's something about it that just , it is n't just slapstick ,
i think a lot of this is coming out of ,
my , my point was that there is , for people who do n't want to do the military service , there , it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and , uh , sense of community that the boy scouts ,
i think that 's , that 's what they need to do . be more proactive like that .
and , uh , i think that , uh , in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve .
it 's okay for us to go extend our youth 's lives like so much water in the desert .
i think there 's probably things i could think of short of murder that someone , i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for .
it 's scary .
but i was , it was great .
uh , you know , they do n't always have their full wits about them .
so i think that 's where you know , , kind of where he 's stuck .
but because he was n't read his rights whenever he was arrested , you know ,
and i 'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor , and hopefully that they would have their , um , accreditations there too .
i do n't think there 's any definitive , you know ,
it 's weird .
now it 's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly , i 'm sure .
the hard thing is getting going .
i guess if that 's all we 've done
i think we should have helped the , the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more ,
that 's pretty good .
and , well , anyway that would , of course , eventually come back to taxes .
well , they 're so spread out ,
like i say , lot of , lot of cases is usually just apartments and , and break ins and things like that
and it 's getting the respect and , which is about time .
so those small little trucks and cars like that , they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good .
if someone 's having personal problems for some reason that 's causing them to h- , behave differently --
but , and , i mean , i 'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that
but i 'm not sure i could afford three .
and i think that 's terrible .
um , part of this i suppose is justified in , in that the climate they do n't need , perhaps , the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need .
but --
you 're brave .
i mean it 's good because they , they try new things , you know ,
and , really , if you do n't want the kids , then it 's not the time to have ,
because technology is so , uh , you know , volatile and changing all the time .
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours .
especially the democratic candidates do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah , maybe that could do something to affect our budget --
i , i guess i 'm satisfied ,
so i suspect that it 's , it 's an ever growing problem .
uh , i thought it a good idea too , though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money .
you get the car that 's in the accident
they go to jail ,
i mean it 's not so serious , i guess , until it affects your family
i think , you know , we should have got him while we could --
and pretty soon , you know , you 're at the limit where you 've got to say okay , you 've sacrificed for , you know , so many years at home
well , uh , the , you know , pregnant women are n't supposed to walk along a highway --
you know , they just , they just breed these , they breed them before they 're ready ,
you know , i think it 's one of those things where it 's not viewed upon as being professional .
-- and i 'm not some kind of an idiot ,
which is n't , you know , pretty much what we loo , look for anyway .
and , and , uh --
mumblex want to just , you know , all your salary ca n't even begin --
that 's right .
it can only hurt the deficit picture .
i think they ought to get on with something important .
you do n't know ,
uh-huh .
i 'd say i camp quite a bit .
so maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something .
and to me that 's surprising .
so , uh --
those aerobic classes are , are tough the , the high impact .
he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together .
or do they need a six person jury or , you know , those kinds of things
i 'm just a chicken .
it 's just a matter of finding ,
i just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes ,
well , that 's an up and coming team , though .
i do n't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two .
i , i think it certainly should be one of the options .
oh , that 's , uh , that 's , uh , an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell , i guess .
i , i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that , uh , you know , people would get a fair trial ,
well , people think you burn it , it 's gone ,
so , it , it 's just so complicated anymore , i think .
-- and that 's the hard decision , is , okay , if i 'm going to run in the mornings , what am i , what do i trade it off for .
so , we could do the same thing ,
you go somewhere else .
well , i think ,
and that 's themselves .
but --
i mean ,
that 's a pretty good price
you know , um , i used to think that dallas was better than houston because their zoning --
it makes it a little bit easier , i think , that way .
you know , uh , we sit there
i doubt about that .
that can , that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day , or more in school
they , they had a , a lot more trunk space .
it 's , uh , it 's a new , uh , form i think ,
because , you know , they 're just , uh , in my experience ,
it 's just the same old thing ,
they quickly let you off jury duty i hear , um .
make sure we get our cash flow .
you know ,
but , but people --
that 's something i could learn actually .
well , that 's odd because i do n't think the teachers in my school district , uh , were well paid .
and this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem .
i 'm sure that , um , whatever you decide , you 'll be happy with .
and --
uh , detroit has n't been having that great a year this year .
mandatory , i mean , summary execution , on the steps , that day .
and they had an interesting time there .
but you are responsible for that company growth .
i- , it 's very difficult to purchase , um , items that are as good as what you can make yourself .
it 's just very , very different
that 's the way , the way the pendulum seems to be swinging , right now .
i think that maybe , uh , a good solution to capital punishment might be , uh , reserve it solely for , uh , repeat offenders of a crime like , uh , murder .
uh , and , but , but , a little bit strange and esoteric
but there 's still a , an , an inequality in the --
and ,
and , and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now , that that 's complicated the entire process .
well , then i guess there are a lot of , a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country .
well , it 's , it 's not that easy .
i think they have a good head on their shoulders .
and it 's almost like they 're killing each other off
um , i think , uh , like in my situation , today , on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together , my husband 's been off doing his thing all day today ,
and , and when there 's nobody there ,
but not as much as we should .
they 're more interesting .
but i do believe it should be befitting the crime .
and , but i think the , i think semiautomatic weapons , people say they use them because it , for sport .
it is some type of lily .
i- , it sound ,
it 's , it 's a gamble ,
oh , well , this is a wonderful thing that , that you 're doing here still helping them out .
and then , you know , you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it
it 's not like , uh , most television where you , you know , you just , you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but ,
it 's , it 's not there .
and my biggest fear would , that they would be , is that they would be lonely .
and we went in and did in seven days what iran could n't do in seven years , you know .
and that is , uh --
and , and the cost of living here is just so tremendously , you know , outrageous .
and , um , i 'm sure that it , for you , it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself ,
and there 's a lot of those mumblex blair shows floating around .
it 's really a bad situation here .
the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases , young college .
they could n't cover my hourly rate .
but , uh , everything should be started on the lower levels
it 's like , uh , going down to get your license and checking your eyes .
well , we 'll have to keep up with that then .
i , i think it should be , i- , it should go to the , to the heart of the matter though and say , okay guy ,
but i guess --
-- and that 's , that 's a fun th- ,
they ca n't be accepted into society .
but you play with the same people , you , you are n't going to learn anything .
i bet dursban would do it .
actually i think probably if i were going to get a- , if i were going to be practical , which does n't mean i would be ,
for , for waco
now , a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that 's socialism
i do n't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives .
you know , as a health professional , i would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs .
that 's good , in a way .
you must see kids with real significant problems , uh , in some cases .
-- learn how to adapt ,
that 's the worst neighborhood in the whole c- , area .
i would n't worry about that .
well , and here lately it has n't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high .
well , especially around , uh , you know , equipment , machinery and stuff .
but i do n't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment --
they do n't .
some of it just is n't ,
and the paid time off is wonderful ,
but then there 's that side of me that says , yeah ,
but it 's , it 's very good .
so ,
i do n't see any sense in someone living that does things like that .
i think the reason why we 've got these guys in congress is because of the fund raising rules .
you can relax that way ,
and it is buys you time to do other things , like have a dinner party , i guess .
uh , th- , they keep up c- , with it pretty quickly
you have to watch that too .
uh , i think that maybe we 're not their big bad enemy any more .
i really do think that 's part of it .
but i think it would be a great idea .
and not that many people are really trying i do n't think .
-- but i 'm not sure that that 's really that much of the problem .
and you get them back again .
it 's pretty tough .
i , i think the medical profession is just , just pushing until there 's no option but the government take it over
i , i have a problem with their viewpoint
i just did n't find that one to be real ,
but one way of doing it is , uh , by income .
there 's a tyler state park that 's , uh , really a nice camping area ,
and then it 's too late to try to change them around at that point .
uh , and i think a lot of their problems is poverty .
-- that 's like everything else , though .
well , the cowboys were th- , america 's football team ,
they are , the two of them are mainly pretty much the , they have cornered the market on trumpet .
there are very few scouts go on ,
i , i think so , too .
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them , okay now you 're not going to get to vote
you , you , you ca n't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- , work ou- , out .
uh , and it also helps when they were winning .
and i think that anybody that works in the , in some kind of service or for the community or something ,
so i guess i ca n't really --
but hopefully , they have .
well , do n't you think a lot of that is diet too ?
and you worry when ,
most the time they have a pretty good guarantee ,
well , it 's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run , i think , that you do n't have to be concerned about your wardrobe .
and you 're driving back home
it 's a very personal thing .
and , before long , you , you get this , this whole kind of gestalt , this whole package of , of health , of health care and options --
surely we 've made it .
for example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going ,
i mean , and it , it might be something that he would n't be able to control .
it , it seems to be kind of halfway between , uh , something like all in the family and , uh , hill street blues .
that --
you ca n't tell one japanese car from the other ,
in fact in , i think if people would learn to turn off the t v -s
but i think they 'll wind up like us at some point , where people sort of , only half of them will end up voting , and sort of caring enough to really make a statement ,
flex time is great .
but ,
but , um , we definitely need something there with all the hostages and --
they are --
and it 's k- , it really is kind of scary because there 's , there 's just oodles of them .
also , i think , uh , a good argument for that is in the area of politics , you know ,
we need more parents willing to supervise ,
or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than killing them , you know ,
there 's nothing like them .
but i would prefer to find , a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians .
that 's interesting the , the way , term you used continentals , which i 'm sure is the proper term .
and , um --
i , i , i think that certainly is a problem .
some crazy hit man over there so ,
and , uh , and yet anybody who 's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up .
but i think it 's something that needs to stay .
i think there 's a point ,
i think in places ,
that would have been something .
and it , you know , it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain , a drain .
then we get out of that phase ,
it 's probably a lot worse now .
and that 's not the kind of society we have right now .
a lot of times , uh , the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury
there 's a lot of different things that , uh , come into play
and i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it .
you know , but that 's another issue altogether .
and then when you read about that they 're spending all the money on , you know , these studies that have no relevance whatsoever , that kind of ticks you off , too .
that 's true ,
i think that 's kind of a good show .
so i guess i , i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems .
so it , you know , it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place .
so , i think the evolution will be interesting .
well , there is so much about it --
-- and i , i find that the classical music is very good for the kids too , it does n't disturb them and --
there 's no competition , so what you get is what you get .
you know , sometimes that even helps them , just being around young people to , because some of them are so , um , just stationary --
uh , it all depends upon the way you structure the environment .
and that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants , they end up being put in homes ,
like a lot ,
it really concerns me , that , um , first of all , that anyone could let someone live like that ,
-- i think that discourages a lot of people .
-- you know , it 's going to take the , uh , a whole generation of my feeling , uh , before that 's going to be accomplished .
something that they turn ,
you know , that 's a good way to approach it .
that 's , you know , that 's the problem .
i mean , every human being that lives is a contributor ,
you know , people did n't like him .
if the industry comes --
but the cost of these nursing homes are so ,
but apparently , he 's a , a worker .
i guess it is possible to have a false positive report .
uh , i think , i think there really is a , there 's a lot they need to learn , you know , when you get there .
and they would n't even think of it
i mean ,
exercise is not supposed to do that to you .
so .
i think it 's a trend that 's , that 's , that 's , uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need .
and i know a lot of people it would , would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup
but you can watch the characters develop ,
it 's for , i think , at the same it 's for some people to , you know , help them grow in other areas ,
i think they would generate probably , uh , one of them would probably generate enough for three cars .
i 've nailed the problem down
but i still think there 's a lot of , there 's a lot of resentment .
i do know that , uh , politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths .
but they 're not that much fun , you know ,
that , it 's good because it does make you think , about your own family .
you hope .
let 's , let 's dump him .
and it seems , seems as though the , the system does n't cha- , tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done .
twilight zone rules , man .
really good ending --
you can be better than that .
you do n't sound like a nonexempt , jim .
i , yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little , little too lenient .
i think it 's , i think it 's a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it ? , bureaucracy and , and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption .
and trying to rehabilitate him , too ,
uh , i guess my feelings are that , uh , we almost have a universal health care system , uh , to a great degree , except that now i read where we 've left out about thirty-four million people .
and that , and that , so that 's a terrible time to have to deal with that , right in , when it , when it counts so much .
you have to have an awful lot of fun
it 's , it 's kind of hard to
that sounds so interesting .
i think it 's a good reason to quit buying it .
you know , kind of mumblex off what we 've been talking about here , uh , i believe that our , we 've become almost a litigious society where we , everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff ,
i always thought too that , you know , people worrying about going to work when their child , when their children are little
-- but i 'm not sure that 's , that 's widely followed any more .
they wo n't be able to pay it
but still sort of up in that general --
-- that 's for sure .
you consider how much , um ,
course , there are emergencies , you know , that you , you know , probably need to have a card .
if they had more money or more , more resources to work more on rehabilitation ,
because , you know , even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when , uh , when , when you 're growing up in , you know , in a home which may be , uh , just the pits ,
you know , they , they 'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat .
i think , you know ,
never be the same ,
and it 's , uh , really scary sometimes .
and it 's ,
whereas , uh , sean connery has maintained the , uh , how would you , uh , ruddy look ,
uh , they 're , they 're going to be doing a lot of interesting things .
i suppose you watch for huri- , hurricanes coming in and --
and women 's rights , i mean , things for women were totally different for you by that time .
i think that 's really important ,
you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got , you know .
well , they are probably not doing very well at all .
an , and if they go to their friends dealing drugs , they 're going to be in even worse shape .
after you 've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go , is that all that 's in there .
that would be .
we have got a lot of that influence .
good move .
um , but , you know i suppose some places are , are more stringent about that than others .
so , anyway , well , we all agree .
but the kids ,
we 'd have fewer decisions to make .
i think movies are losing their attractiveness , just to a lot of people .
i , i would like to see the money that 's been budgeted , budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of , of alternate solutions to the problem .
you know , that 's , that 's , that 's why we hire people who , uh , you know , to , to make these decisions for us .
and , uh , i think that 's the main problem at this point .
and , uh ,
and , uh , i think things are changing ,
i think it may be pushing people , hopefully push people away from drug use ,
people are pretty excited about it .
you know , you like to have someone like that you could point to say , see what a fine man , that , he is .
-- uh , and you do n't know where it 's going to end .
so it , it was a strange combination .
that 's , that 's potential indication of balance .
well i am sure it was , you know .
but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live --
you know , so it , it 's , i , i think , i think in , in the end , the judge has the presiding , you know , uh , vote .
and then , the united states has this attitude by saying , you know , thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that .
well , of course that 's the other advantage of paint .
but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to , to clients unless they feel they can , you know , tweak a jury into --
so , i think that , that became ,
and the , the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up .
and , a lot of that is diet .
and in the long run , we 're all paying for that --
it gives you energy .
well that could ,
that way husbands are crippled ,
and you 've got to let those , you know , those ,
and warren moon ,
well , maybe i need to run out there this weekend .
it 's ki- , i find it kind of sad ,
so , you know , if you do have any time , it 's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done , uh , ju- , just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then , plus try to have that relationship with your children ,
maybe they 're starting to get a clue . uh ,
and then they , you know , caught everybody .
if it had not been for my wife , i would have probably been in debtor 's prison ,
-- uh , it , it depends on the person ,
they kind of say , well what do you want me to believe .
when , when your own children are growing up , you just take them for granted
and these people have not benefited from the stay there .
i think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be .
the judicial system is aimed at the citizens
it 's where it 's most expedient which ,
they just do n't have the money or just feel that there is n't the need for it .
and , uh , --
it , it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier .
they said about magazines .
that is , uh , a big drawback i think in that , in the , uh , public schools out here .
you would have to be able to have enough ,
and the ones that get the most pay do the least work .
but , that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow .
he 's , he 's helped out in a lot of ways .
they try to stay in office .
-- so you can probably see them sometimes .
well , you know , it 's interesting , because when i heard the topic , i was thinking , uh ,
and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow .
and it should ,
well you can gain too much weight .
and that 's interesting .
at least at the end .
in a big city like that most houses , i would think , would be sort of like what we live in . just a you know , basic tract house .
i do n't know about dallas , but arou- , even in this little town , it 's , it 's not cheap at all .
i mean they go right back where they came from .
but you still have to --
i think , really to get out there and dig in the dirt ,
but they 're a lot more trouble than cats actually .
they get too boring .
i mean right now lobbyists require to register you 'd just say ,
i think that 's really , that 's important
and it just continues to get worse .
and so ,
and , so , i think that kind of control is , would be good ,
well , you know , the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it tak- , that it took to contest the , the football , um , issue .
and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash , you know --
but i really feel that , that i 'm just getting overtaxed .
it just was not effective enough to ...
that 's not ,
they 'll get it
a lot of times i think it 's our own fault .
i think they did a real good job of that .
you can at least say that it 's important to our country ,
and , uh , you know , if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer , well , then i 'll around a lot longer ,
but it 's real hard to make them .
it was one of these you have bad experience and ,
and it , it just makes stuff move down .
you got to , you got to be your child 's best friend , i guess ,
and , if , if you do n't work for somebody that 's got enough clout to , to , uh , uh , give you , you know , give you these rates and make this agreement --
and people who do have them ,
they 've , they 've relinquished their parenting .
and they 're just so thin and ,
it 's a deterrent to crime ,
and what i mean by that , the more income you make , the more tax you pay .
like i said , we are probably as far as you can get from the seven eleven and still be in texas .
and i just do n't feel that ...
so this was n't necessarily a big conversation ,
and then there 's kind of the , the branch manager level --
or they wo n't be as good as they could be .
when you find the right cookbook , why it works out .
because , in my opinion , i do n't think i 'm ever going to see any of this peace , so-called peace dividend .
so , it really is a different , um ,
but there 's an element that ca n't .
most people are n't .
uh , depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford , different things like that ,
you 're , you 're aware of that kind of thing .
so , i- , i- , if i have one , it must be very , very slight .
and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it
but would n't it be mu- , much nicer if we all did it ,
i , i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse ,
it was not bad
and that 's a real attractive option , if you have the , the technology for it .
that 's a , that 's a fortunate benefit , you know , that they 're so active --
um , well , that 's , but that 's why they should have s , started doing stuff before .
you can compare just about everyth- , thing to japan
uh , and , but it , but it 's the , the same , the effect is the same as the ,
but that 's a lot of pain and hassle .
and a lot of them are going back there .
and i think , you know , you have to teach how to write an answer and , you know , how to construct a thought process .
um , one thing that has kept our tax burden high , and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the , is the level of def- , of the defense budget --
starts with the one person that , you know ,
mumblex i mean there 's plans there
mississippi probably does n't ,
because they 've got the hitting ,
or the way you look ,
but i , i 'm really leery of a , kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan , because i just feel like everything that the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly
but ,
and it would be considered good because it 's madonna , you know .
that would n't be so bad .
let 's put him into a situation where , okay , you crossed the line , you broke the rule , you 're going to have to pay for it .
uh , but it 's on the uprise , especially in a lot of the , uh , outlying agricultural towns .
and they just , they 're not meant to last ,
plus the training involved .
i really do n't .
they usually most of the time do n't open very well .
uh , this is a little bit of the subject ,
if they did n't have ,
so it ,
that wa , that was pretty good .
i guess i 'm probably a lot like you .
but the , uh , i , i really feel that , that the law enforcement community , uh , you know , puts these people behind bars
and i do n't think it needs to be the mothers ,
if you can afford them .
the cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music .
if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic , you know , inter , intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might .
and the county adds theirs ,
a hundred per grade , that 's a good size .
it 's great ,
but it 's not nice when they 're too attentive .
oh , that is a fun show .
well , it sounds like you have really strong views on it .
there is a lot the community , the community can do to , uh , enhance the , or , or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home .
and they do n't want to take the responsibility
it 's a , , it 's not a tiny area . uh ,
they just did an excellent job .
but then there are baby-sitting groups .
but , uh , again , uh , that did n't occur without a crisis .
oh , boy , you have a lot of kids .
but now bench or step aerobics have --
you know , so , well , i think there 's music all around anyway .
i mean , we educate them ,
so --
they , i think they look at it as , well everybody , the majority of the people think this way , when that 's not necessarily true ,
you reduce the deficit ,
i suppose that 's true ,
i think they 've got , i think there are more pressing problems .
that 's true .
now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for , uh , brand new ,
and you are like , why are they repeating ?
six thousand is just getting broken in for them .
you , you would hope that if you were in that situation that you 'd have the moral fortitude , uh , to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response .
now , now we are a , uh , a legitimate player ,
in order to continue to , to grow and
seems like there 's a pretty well , there 's a p- , pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics --
-- just set it up
and i thought it was really , well i do n't know , asinine actually .
my belief all my life , i guess , has been that , that if you take someone else 's life , then you automatically are giving up , uh , yours in place of it .
-- and that was , i think , what really prejudiced me against american cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality , uh , car .
spend more time on the ,
but , you 're not likely to find somebody who is going to , you know , have a less conscientious effort .
and they have a way of dragging you back home .
well , it 's for everybody 's benefit .
-- but still they have an op- , an opportunity to be with other children --
uh , i would imagine that we 've talked the amount of time necessary .
if you want to stop the crime , i think you 've got to get , uh , the people when they are kids .
well i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference ,
it would be hard ,
that 's a big laugh ,
it 's my feeling that if you do n't have a role model to follow --
that 's still pretty far though .
i think it 's great .
you can be , uh , get in trouble for that .
our families have changed .
and i guess , you know , when you stop to think of it , these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they 've needed all their lives .
and there 's nothing wrong with that , you know , if ,
the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics ,
they 're , they 're pretty well refined today --
very personal .
i think it 's , it 's kind of interesting that everybody 's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done .
maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes .
and it is going to be about six times more expensive .
so --
it 's a lot of work --
i mean it was all right ,
the- , the- , there has to be some way to do it .
and you can even ,
they may be coming out ahead .
well , you need to , uh , teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you .
-- semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and , and , uh , get him down .
i , i personally feel that , uh , uh , if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them , you know , that 's the way it goes
but the- , uh , a lot of emphas- , now is being put on , you know , when children used to be taught , you know , like , uh , uh , each child is individual ,
and , uh , maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people .
we do n't need to back talk ,
it 's , it 's amazing the way ,
there are things i should do .
-- i think with working moms , if you can get them ma- , the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they 're going to do with year-round school where you work ,
it 's slow , though .
well , one of the things i was thinking about is , uh , you know , from society 's point of view , if you put a value on each person , what you want to do is to maximize the end game value .
i think if there 's any major piece of advice i 'd give , is to find a way of getting an education that does n't incur that kind of debt .
well , i see that as an advantage to a credit card , also --
i mean , goll- , how humiliating for a man to do that , any man .
i mean , you 're , you 're participating ,
and it 's , it 's not in our national consciousness to do it .
course there 's a few things that , uh , i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the c e o 's seat
well that was , uh , that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up .
it 's pretty slow .
those are , those are , uh , i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes .
but , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able to , uh , put out as guidelines for their employees .
they 're good .
unless they 're caught in the act or the- , the- , the child is very badly , you know , beaten up , it comes down to a one word against the other --
there 's a lot of really good i b m compatibles , too .
and , and teaching i still see that that 's where most of the woman are .
that 's good .
i mean , i just do n't understand these people that think taking an r v ,
and i , uh , i , i think it gives you a better perspective ,
but again , um , it must be depressing for the people who , who are , who are just e- , e- , essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but , but , certainly , uh , certainly have ar , ar , are , have retained all of their , uh , mental skills and so on .
they 're so independent ,
and i 'd have to go in the other
well , it 's , it 's hard on the children too ,
but , i 'm not for sure we know exactly what , what all happened in that situation ,
i know of cases where , uh , we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but , with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they 're talking about is the same thing they are showing you .
there , there 's so much down in all of south america , uh , so much potential , you know ,
if it , if it 's just one more piece of something ,
and th- , the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on .
but if you , you know , have a family and , and , um , everybody 's gone to different doctors , uh , it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your , just has , you know , all the medical history
and indeed his trend started upward .
and , you know , in those those kinds of situations , uh , room rent which is outrageous .
god . that 's a , that 's a lot .
um you know i 'm sure that dinner parties will
i guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where , what you 're going to do when you go ,
you ca n't mumblex ,
you know , whether that 's two --
um , of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world , too .
and , and you know , but the way the courts are set up they 've , they 've got so many chances for appeal ,
they do n't really come out like they do in new orleans , up here ,
and ,
social change is always going to go on ,
someone is calling for someone else to be killed , you know .
so it 's kind of a , a unfair advantage ,
it 's kind of haunting , you know , on , on some of the notes .
plus all the problems in the middle east .
and they need to start another one .
and it 's not , it 's not , um , it 's not easy to do --
i really beli ,
which is good .
you really ca n't .
it 's wonderful .
well , you know that 's interesting though .
and i do n't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge did n't have the final say .
a super do salary of any kind .
and he 's kind of like your wife .
i think that 's , um ,
little value just in whatever you do .
they 're going to get cards at the ,
you can , you can page through it in ,
now that 's sad , when there 's supposed to be what , you know , one thousand , what , sixty-five dollars , something like that , spent on each pupil .
uh , but it 's , you know , it 's , it 's okay .
and yet so many of the citizens are the uh , the lebanese .
that 's a good point ,
and the , the other part is , that the , the , when , when your , when your , when your looking at vietnam , and you say , well , is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it .
well , the limits , uh , uh , would , i think , have to do with what i 'd alluded to before , that there needs to be a further , um , that , that one positive on a drug test ,
it 's funny because most women are n't really ,
or , or , or , or some other thought provoking area , you know .
it 's , uh , funny that you said .
i hope he stays cute --
i mean , i can see paying the interest and some small penalty
trying to find a jury --
i think that is an excellent program ,
i 'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way .
and they have just done as much as they can for that man ,
and , uh , it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do , what --
that would be neat ,
you know , maybe it will average out ,
hopefully , the next generation , it wo n't even be an issue ,
well i think that it 's just , that 's ex ,
that 's the majority of people that i know of anyways .
and i , it just amazes me that the french do n't recognize that .
oh , it is , it 's fabulous .
i tell you what , the fumes that the , the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any- ,
he did great .
i do n't think they can , they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i , i --
-- and it , it 's too costly
it 's been out of hand , i think , for a while ,
but it , it sounds like you are , uh , you know ,
but i , i thought it was up there .
that 's a good feeling .
he 's been doing real good .
it 's just not very comfortable ,
a little bit in the world .
and , you know , the second time you see it , you understand more subtleties in it .
so , it 's um , it was , it was a fun movie .
that 's always a bummer too .
you , you need to play that often --
but in civil cases , i think a majority rule by , by jury would be sufficient .
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands .
you know ,
well , i think science has come a long way to making it so that it 's possible to find ways to solve the problem .
there 's a lot , yeah , lot of hidden taxes .
and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life --
the problem is that i 've , that i 've read books that ,
because that 's what our society becomes .
i , i must admit that the production costs of , of these drugs are , are zippo compared to the street market costs and , and the costs to society ,
but it 's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period .
but when you first came out , you were n't real sure .
radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done .
it 's probably , i would think it would be hard on your , your legs and your joints and stuff .
and then they do n't even do that recommendation , you know .
well , it sounds like he 's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants to do .
and technical people know that .
he 's tender hearted fellow .
well that , that , i mean that 's very , young for a baby .
if you want to do something every night that 's fine ,
but the atmosphere and service i think , are important , uh --
so it 's , it 's really quite pretty .
and it is unbelievable --
way , way more than i can stand down here .
i mean i just think they watch so much more t v .
more than it 's worth .
and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they do n't want to do it ,
and you ca n't make up in a classroom of one hour a day ,
and i think that 's a shame .
we do n't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning .
well , that sounds like fun .
it 's not feasible to do everyone ,
that sounds good , too .
i think that 's wrong .
and phone calls that 's about , about it .
i 'm sure they are there .
and i , i do n't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal .
and then you never feel like you 've got anything to p , to put into savings or anything ,
i , i guess i should have specified ,
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to .
that 's one reason i went with it because i , subaru had a good reputation , uh , for , you know , low maintenance ,
and you do n't want them sent off to the middle east to --
that 's , uh , can stifle creativity .
oh , that could be , uh , making up for the difference .
uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity f- , to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided .
you know , if someone were studying something , mumblex take something obscure . somebody was studying economics , the state department could offer to send them to the soviet union for two years to teach them how to run their country .
i , i think that the piano background is very , um , useful ,
babies are fun ,
that 's a , that 's a , a tough one .
and things that are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require ,
that 's not doing anything .
it is absolutely delicious .
uh , they 're high scoring ,
we do not know ,
you know , i think it 's more safety than anything else .
so what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country .
they 're great .
well , i think first degree murder , uh , probably warrants it .
they destroyed it .
sometimes it 's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one .
oh , that 's tough .
they wo n't say yes and they wo n't say no to just certain issues just because they do n't know what the public wants , or the public 's split on it .
maybe to you and i who have grown up in some in , uh , uh , some more beautiful parts of the country , uh , i think that , that , uh , we become a little more aware , uh , rather quickly of , of what 's happening with air pollution and how , uh , how horrible it really is .
you do n't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles .
but they do dig up
rugby is definitely big in college
the , the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will , you know , want to hang everyone ,
it 's there 's not a choice , it 's --
but it should n't be too hard to do something like that .
that 's a good thing .
but it 's fun .
so , i , i , i mean as , as man has gotten more complicated so all of the , uh , imaginations to , uh , you know , protect him from , from being , uh , dumped on by , uh , civilian authority in , in so- , in criminal actions , especially , you know , murder cases and that sort of thing .
a lot of people are eating healthier now a days .
i do n't think much of li- , of life imprisonment . first of all , it 's never , turns out to be life ,
so , i mean , it , it kind of gives you a false sense of security .
but it 's true , you know ,
and ,
and a lot of times it is added for no real , uh , valid reason .
employers ultimately , have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years .
and , you know , i leave that with the governor , who , of course , is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected ,
seems like , um , to me , everything is just changing so much that it 's almost like , um , you ca n't keep up with things any more ,
and , uh , the benefits are n't as great when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay
we are n't tackling a massive ballot every four years .
well , i was thinking , if you 've been there that long , you 've seen plano grow --
that 's exactly where both of the wives came from i think .
or you do n't know what they st- , you know , where they stand or anything like that .
but , uh , i guess most of the things that happen around here are , are pretty , uh , innocuous .
the idea itself of service is good
it never really has .
when the shoe is on the other foot and see how it ,
it 's , it 's going to , it 's going to take quite a while .
just , just , put them outside , i guess . unless you ca , catch them in the act .
so , uh --
but yet have this ,
i think it will change ,
on the other hand , you know , the ironic thing about this is that there 's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than our first generation immigrant .
but , uh . sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined ,
there 's not many half hour shows ,
and you ca n't , the american government you ca n't trust them either , because you think , you do n't know how corrupt they are . i mean they keep people in power like the shah of iran and ,
uh , being a former drug user .
as far as this , that good or bad or what .
and , uh , then with , uh , uh , the defense , with bruce smi- , bruce smith there at linebacker there , they 've got a very well rounded team
well --
well , what i do n't like about , uh , sentence , the jury doing the sentencing --
well , i guess it would still depend on how ,
just to get you by five years
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you 'll see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that , you know , women are paid less than men
and it 's one that needs a great deal of thought ,
or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight .
mumblex i believe you should have the testing
it would be interesting to see if they can find , uh , other planets that are , that will be more habitable to , uh , you know , uh , humans
this is , this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female .
you ca n't forget how to ride a bike .
it 's a kind of one of those psycho ones .
because , uh , you have deaths .
it 's getting harder and harder to survive .
i think it 's because he 's always heard music in our home all the , since he was a baby .
and , uh , you know , yo- , there 's a , uh , a nice warm feeling ,
oh , it is ,
it , it 's not so much , sure the contest itself and the game itself ,
i mean , they 're , they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever ,
and things are getting worse .
one of these days my grandkids probably .
you do n't see yourself getting .
and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and
-- but , uh , um , the housing is just ,
they need to have a fair jury
there 's an element there 's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere .
you know , it was , it was just automatic , too ,
i i think you know if they if they did n't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag , it would never happen
but i always , see it 's all , it 's all money .
and sometimes that 's not real fair either , though
it is , it is more in depth , less broad .
and all these god-fearing people were like , well , you know --
so , it , it was really neat .
they might as well have not even been there .
they gave us a hard topic .
but you got to have people that can make , you know , earn a salary to pay for this conversion .
there 's too much , uh , um , underhanded , uh , things going on that the public are not aware of .
it 's just unreal .
if you do get a job , they do n't pay benefits .
when they , when it 's not there they miss it .
and it 's not clear to me that , that 's so much less democratic .
i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty , something like that .
if they release them two hours later , he probably does n't deserve the death penalty ,
so people do n't really worry about their local mayor or something , figuring that , you know , and i think wrongly , figuring that , that , well , what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now , and you know , and stuff like that .
it 's not my best subject .
i guess it , it really is n't for everybody .
well i believe that we 've been talking about five minutes .
and they 're getting nicer .
i guess you have to check yes
well , i am not so sure that texans know what , what they have got .
that was , was really good .
and they 're going to be right back for the same thing
so , it , it has surprised everybody .
course , they 'd be , they would be barred ,
especially when you have a family , with children , and you are always going to the doctor for ,
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest ,
i guess , uh , you do n't really think about it too much .
basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven
if it 's really old , you do n't know what it 's put on with .
the , the yuppiedom ,
well , uh , the police force , for one ,
and with the banks being in such financial , you know , problems now that people ,
it would be a sort of day care ,
just never .
so i , so i think , you know , we 're probably reaching a successful stage and , and just with voluntary ,
or , or it 's not happening in your backyard --
-- when you 're getting paid millions to do it , you ac- , i think they take it to another level .
and , and there 's no way that you can get them , unless it 's by force .
i know
but it just may not of the original ,
i mean , their friends are the most important thing there is .
i guess it comes with the turf .
it 's such a slow process
and it was , it was really terrible .
-- and we lived without them ,
well it 's just the same thing with the car , uh , uh , the gasoline ,
i mean , uh , i think that , uh , that a player ought to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch to do it ,
and that was part of the problem , when they went into the promise land ,
so you know it must be frus , --
let 's face it ,
and , and , you know , you want to appease the people that have suffered .
you do n't know any of that
they always either have
and , uh , you know , i think that , that , that the problem with having , you know , junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with , uh , you know , with in , inept politicians --
it is obvious .
and , uh , it seems like it 's just a , an added tack on .
uh , which does not make ,
i , i s- , i lean more towards the control side than , than towards , you know , just the , the free , free army .
i think those gu- , those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines , if they would have gone with it ,
uh , everybody is going to be affected by it .
just , you know , so mild ,
and unfortunately they are not .
soviet bloc countries you are , are obliged to vote too .
there 's a problem with those .
but i suspect it 's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things .
and they 're the ones wasting all the money .
but it 's , it 's hard to define --
i think it was the black hills of south dakota .
learn how to grow in the , in their college or whatever education they might take .
th- , the only way they could do it i think , would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun .
i mean , i know yankees have won a lot games .
seems like they take forever any more ,
you definitely are going to worry about the location , and , uh , you know , accessibility of people to be able to break in .
it 's just a , kind of a challenging game .
uh , i think , uh , with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that 's fun .
and , uh , it , it gets bad .
i think they 're really going to have to , and not , and not just for mothers , for fathers as well .
i think that 's neat ,
well , that 's probably the next year 's agenda .
and i 'm thinking that community service would help them , uh , just get a feel of what else is out there , how other people are living , you know ,
at least one not more than say three or four , then it would definitely effect unemployment .
and i think maybe it 's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along .
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there 's not even a person there .
i can , i can believe that .
you know he 's done what he 's done .
we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine .
it 's not top wages ,
so that , it , it 's really neat ,
what i thought was interesting is that , uh , apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet .
-- most of them do .
uh , sales is lucrative
apparently , an earth quake caused it .
someone is going to assassinate him , you know .
because iran still is n't too friendly with them .
and i 'd say , you know , they were doing things then that we should be doing now
the other thing that i think is good for like american businesses are to be involved is the , the reports that i hear back
they ca n't afford to have a really good job .
-- and i do n't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some .
i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them .
total indifference , you know ,
two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book .
i think it 's great , that you know , freedom of speech in this country and everything ,
obviously not very fast .
you know , kids ca n't read , um ,
and , uh , evaluation of an individual . course , all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have .
the point being , and your sons will learn this from you , i 'm sure , that , uh , no matter what age you are , you can learn --
if we , if we keep putting that stuff into the air and , and , you know , if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it 's really going to be a problem for , um , just the , the earth , you know , what the earth is receiving back , you know ,
something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me ,
i guess you run into the pollution factor .
and they 're friends ,
texas has quite the history .
get something out of that money .
i think .
or --
so --
everyone was discussing whether we should , uh , wait longer ,
i 'd hate to have to ,
they make a decision based on consti- , constituency --
and who , all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another .
nobody could figure it out .
you may never get the truth ,
well , it 's a good past time , you know .
they would be , if you just had time to do it .
you know , so that they 're not very distinguishable from a real gun .
and then we are getting back into us .
i guess because we do n't know ,
i mean , it 'd be , it 'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older .
and the , probably the bigge , biggest problem down there is that 's where the , that 's the drug entry points ,
but i mean there 's , there 's , there 's a lot of other crimes out there , i mean besides murder ,
and especially men who teach school , they do n't make that much money ,
it 's not us .
because these kids are saying why should i go to high school
oh , well ,
but then , they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy .
uh , it , it 's , it 's a little hard to believe ,
and , okay , this , this candidate tells --
well that 's good that they 're so casual .
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is .
and i 'm sure a lot of them do n't .
they should n't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway .
that 's a long time . uh .
and , and , uh , of course , ford is n't too bad .
-- i mean that 's what you , you 're going to have to expect that to happen .
it was a dirty , mud slinging campaign .
i mean , you know ,
the , uh , the cure , some of the cures that i 've heard for this that , that sort of make sense ,
you should have one in the , in the ,
yeah , it --
uh , i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster .
i think the schools today , you know , the public schools are just , they 're just overrun , you know ,
well we have those , uh , which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans .
i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there .
you know , you say , sun room to them , and you enclose and you can sell it .
it should n't go out that much .
but you do n't read many sports books
and i think that 's even going to get better . even , you know ,
and , uh , so i , you know , i do n't know so much if these peace talks are going to ,
and that 's kind of , that 's , that 's probably one thing i 'd look at .
but i tell you i 'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work ,
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt , these people are guilty .
well , the good stuff .
that 's nice sometimes when they --
i mean it 's not just for him ,
i think , i think people are starting to really mean it ,
and it 's just , that 's just ridiculous
uh , another thing i thought of , i guess , to recycle would be like clothes , because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other .
you 're supposed to only want the job ,
it , it 's hard to believe that you 'd run up twenty , thirty thousand dollars of , uh ,
this would be , this would be frightening .
i mean , so many people do n't even get prenatal care
maybe if you get along
the spending is out of control .
because it seems like the small town nursing homes , there 's a --
and so that the other people have no health insurance
so that would make you really ,
the people there have money ,
believe me it 's just so much better .
because they , they understand people more ,
but with the pollution issue , uh , fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway .
and uh , you do n't have any , any kind of a good environment to live in , you know ,
but , i think that still borders on hobby .
and that 's , all cars are doing that .
i know that they are lowering the age of , uh , whatever is considered a minor .
but i do n't know . it 's just hard to , hard to take and , you know , see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use .
-- but i do n't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering .
i , i just ,
it 's , um , one of those things that , you know , seems to happen .
but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes ,
and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits .
i 've always of that to be , uh , really one of the best forms of exercise ,
oh , that would have been such a great memory .
you 're just better off buying another car .
well , had , had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor .
i think it 's hard to find a balance there .
and what comes up , must come down .
-- and if you did n't like it , that was just too bad , you know .
well , the , the one thing that i know does seem to happen from people i 've talked to on this , is that in the situation you just said where it 's nine to three , or some such number , that there 's , an effect starts being that there 's starts being a lot of peer pressure --
that 's kind of , that 's kind of strange .
i think maybe we 've given our teachers a almost impossible job .
then , they do n't really think they should pay for them , maybe .
today 's young people are short-term pleasure oriented ,
that is a real cute show .
so ,
they 're so small --
it 's like , okay ,
-- and that is a pretty big newspaper
because you hate to contribute to the problem ,
they 're not going to take those courses .
in other words , you 'd have to , you 'd have to murder more than one other person --
but i think you need the shoulder thing --
and you just watch it on t v and see how it just burns your brain completely up , you know .
you 're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks , being sort of led out of slavery
and possibly , y- , just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing ,
so then it becomes , uh , more realistic .
but it 's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is .
once you get it done , then you probably wo n't have that problem again .
requires special shoes ,
they looked real pretty until about a week before christmas ,
i do n't know what 's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that , because i think that 's bad for us .
-- and , uh , it really does make a difference , although it , it settles , you know ,
you know , if you 're not working with someone on drugs , well then you 're going to have less accidents ,
it 's a little more understandable under the circumstances , i guess .
after awhile , i , i prefer forty , a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just , just to --
used to be people would say , do you work , and you 'd say , no , i work in the home
but , i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it , that , like that ,
and , i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of ,
and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets .
-- it 's mainl- , lot of blacks .
that 's a lot of power for one or two people to have .
you can hear .
either way , you know , was great .
that 's the most prevalent crime . uh , the ones that really , you know , the ones that really add up after a while , i guess , you know , from , s- , far as insurance money and stuff like that , insurance costs .
it ca n't hurt , .
i mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things --
but , you know , i think , i think that , that , um , we chose to have our official feelings hurt .
that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him .
well , i guess that covers it .
and , yet , they 're , uh , the gun control enthusiasts are , are , uh , preaching about the gun control and how they should be , we should have stronger laws and what not .
and , uh , of course , nothing ever goes down ,
but , maybe we , maybe we 'll get your guy .
it 's not as sound intellectually , but , like you said i mean , come on .
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time ,
well , if you , if you can make yourself do the tread mill , i mean , gosh , that 's a good workout .
it is ,
but only thing i 'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees --
and apparently there was , you know ,
well , that 's a good thing to do .
uh , a waitress or waiter that waits the table , it 's nice that they 're attentive
waterfront property here at love canal , you know .
i think we get short changed on that .
and that 's probably something that , that you could do , you know --
i just can not fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center .
you would have
i think you got it .
some of it 's okay , uh --
it is interesting though ,
i 'm not sure that that 's an everyday thing , though , at least not for , you know , an individual .
but they 're more apt to be in political offices --
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict .
in other words , they 're in there for a purpose ,
and i , i believe that we have to have a military
it 's nice to find a place like that .
it 's very complex , very complicated ,
and then everybody else is stuck with that , regardless of what they want to teach .
boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard ,
but what i see is y- ,
they do those real corny commercials .
in a lot of cases i think you 're treated more like a number instead of a , a person .
and course , growing up on , on the back of a horse , you know , and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was so true
but it does seem , you know ,
it gives you a whole different perspective on the news , uh , when you hear it from , say , a european --
i would n't be the big , uh , snotty kind .
and , uh , then , we can , and we do n't tend to read israel correctly
they always think they can win , you know , which is the way it should be .
and we should see to our own lives , but not to a total disregard of others .
well i ,
but the consequence ,
you just do n't have any time to do anything .
you stand there with a rifle and blow a , a piece of somebody apart ,
so . i , i think as long as people have a choice , they 're going to stick with the american way .
and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him ,
and she could have bought a typewriter also .
oh , that will be fun , too .
a lot of work ,
i think on the local elections it 's actually , um ,
we ca n't live there .
but it 's here .
and so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news .
i mean , people are all different .
and , that 's one of them
the true source of the problem is , a , that we do spend too much ,
and some of them are our problems ,
oh , they , they , they really are .
i 'm not going to listen to the facts or --
that 's the problem --
and you know , if you can do any a little bit , it helps ,
it 's just , it 's never going to reach that , that standard
in ,
it 's frustrating , i guess .
it 's amazing , uh ,
i know they 're trying to do everything they can to , uh , end the recession .
i mean there 's nothing wrong with that .
and i mean the , the technology 's not that hard .
and i just --
they , they wanted to do things .
you hit a little ball ,
or , you have highway signs saying speed limit , uh , eighty , eighty-five , whatever would be the appropriate number .
and the other one 's two point one kis ,
and i ca n't talk about the second one other than to , to , to generate paranoia .
but then there 's these , um , periods like early fall before christmas or early spring when there 's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again , it , uh , will increase the revenues from the movie .
it 's not a problem , uh , because i hate to feel like they are a problem , although they are .
and we make experts by reading books .
but he 's kind of branching out .
and , uh , i , i feel like if they do n't , people do n't like what our flag stands for , they 're welcome to go some place else .
but it 's something you got to think about these days .
i think it has something to do with the poverty level because africa is certainly not a catholic , uh , country ,
so that , that 's the only thing , i think , that might be a little bit of a problem .
the comics are better in this newspaper .
well , the rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect --
but i think you get out of the habit , like you say ,
they have all sorts of , of rights , that , you know , are questionable .
example , they keep raising the taxes on booze ,
i mean there , there 's no connection between the two .
they tend to be more ,
well , dogs are real high maintenances ,
and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to ,
that 's a real warm movie .
but , um , i know that state has , uh , cutback , uh , raises for a year to help , uh , the , uh , state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better --
i think , i think that they 're s- , they 're so much more vulnerable now because they do n't receive support --
and they 're really nice , uh ,
it never gets real cold .
well you wo n't offend me .
i really do n't .
uh , but i 'm not quite sure that it 's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools .
and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by orientals .
maybe there should be more than twelve people .
i do not really know if , uh , any one person knows , uh ,
but there 's too much historical fact involved just from the uh , the histories that are , were developed around that time , that are available .
and i do n't think a lot of people , you know , realize a lot , the plight of a lot of people .
but maybe not the , yo- , you know the canada men 's trip , but some other , you know ,
that 's just not realistic .
we realize that for the individual person , some things are very important .
and nobody would see it ,
that 's kind of the way dallas is .
see that 's why i , it 's interesting because you have i , i 'm going to say you have an accent .
it seemed like , uh ,
so you just never know how that works out .
but you might not be so --
now that 's bad .
huh . well , you would think that they would get that in the , uh ,
and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would , would have better state coverage rather than local coverage .
i would think you 'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than , you know , telling them that there 's , there 's protestors out here at the , you know .
and you have so many out there that , uh , that you , you know , you never get a chance to read .
-- and , uh , but if they are polluting the air , they need , do need to have them fixed --
but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something .
there are a couple of things i think we need to really work for ,
and , --
it , it 's terrible , you know
but , uh , i feel that it 's probably pre- , it 's pretty good if , if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs .
you know , and , uh , that 's something that , that has been , you know , very ,
but everybody perceived him that way , and stuff --
and that , that 's why i think if people were more exposed to , uh ,
i mean there 's no doubt ,
probably if i did , i might be a little bit more , uh , tolerant ,
we did not actually physically lose them .
and now we 're no- , we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game .
like they wo n't have that ,
if you 're , stay at home and you 're a mother , it 's like what a waste .
they just do n't have the same ones in the supermarket .
well , i , i think another thing too that , um , i 've had a little contacted with , uh ,
but , but it 's really good .
yeltsin 's in tight with the old guard .
because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something .
and , uh , there 's not so much of it completely innocent --
and then everything went away for a couple years ,
and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the , uh , early decisions of the vietnam war . that the , uh , people saw the cold war as , uh , you had to draw a line and , and defend it .
um , then again , i do n't know really what steps there are that they ,
they 've proven that .
and , and that should be first and , and children second .
so , we 're comparable .
-- and that 's it .
well , there are those that , that , that think that , that , that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance , particularly for the military .
they 're not doing anything about ,
you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products .
but usually they are n't .
well , it can get expensive --
because you know , you have to ,
i , i am a little concerned about you know ,
i do n't think it would convict any more people .
but i have a feeling that we , that we really do n't understand basically the , the , the competing factions in lot of those countries
but they do .
it 's scary .
you know , they 're not all the same
apparently they do n't think it 's a problem .
i mean it , it sounds good to the public
but it 's big enough .
the type of music , at least to me , it 's , uh , sounds like it 's only sounds good at a high volumes
now , the one thing i did approve of there was that we did n't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case .
it must be the marketing pressures ,
very much so .
and that , you know , that was so wonderful that they done that
and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you do n't have to go through the company to get .
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes .
would be some measure of protection .
well , i think it 's a big , it 's a big , um , responsibility .
uh , you know , it , it just seemed to lack any sort of debate .
using your social security number , of course , permits people to do that --
you see it on the news all the time ,
so that , that , that 's the current predicament .
you do n't even , even know about it .
uh , anyway , the , our benefits are pretty good .
and it makes you think about things .
and that , you know , that is what makes it so interesting .
i think we 've probably know , know each other 's exercise habits --
and i 'm sure you 've , you 've labelled the cause , because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave .
i bet it 's pretty over there .
and it was just a complete culture shock ,
so , he , i mean , i do n't think he , he could get hurt .
late , late sixties , early seventies , they were --
and that i think has contributed much to , uh , the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we 're having . uh , that the students ' , uh , parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning
we 're still not able to pay off things just because --
one is education for civic duty .
when you are talking again , uh , billions and trillions of dollars --
right that 's --
but ,
and , and i think that 's where we as american people really failed , you know , failed them .
i think that 's where a lot of the problem is at first .
i think that education with a gun is , is critical and important .
i guess you have to take some things and leave some things .
and it 's k- , it 's kind of scares me , not that i do n't want them here and not that i do n't appreciate the fact that , you know , that they have rights too .
it 's lopsided , very much
that is , that is a pretty good clip
and you 're just more aware of food for energy ,
and it 's safe .
i think that , uh , desert storm ,
it was constantly , no , i do n't want him ,
and some of them are like , uh , videos --
but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for , um , people to invade your privacy when they want to ,
and boy that really pumps them up .
i do n't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much .
the problems that their kids get into , are , are good to , uh , show that they do have problems anyway .
and it is n't .
two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing , you know , it 's true that , you know , this may be sad and all that thing ,
so , uh , but it is something that 's a little frightening
the laws are a little squirrelly ,
you ca n't put it in pictures .
and --
well , you know , these guys that gambled high --
but if they were careful , they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works .
you just do n't think of that happening with teachers --
and , i thought that was really good .
if they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience , i think most people would .
you 'd have to be scared to death .
so , uh , i , i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets
and that 's a big mistake ,
so , i guess we 're supposed to start talking .
you probably would n't have ,
also , much of it is driven by economics right now .
lot of the classics are really ,
i think we 're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have --
and it 's healthy , too .
and , but i think you 'd have to really ,
they 're stupid .
that 's and that 's the
it seems that , uh , bermuda 's , bermuda 's fine
but , uh , some of the crap that 's on t v nowadays ,
i think they know what they believe
it 's , there 's a lot of factors that people do n't ever , ever consider --
uh , i can see some , some potential changes that probably are , are , would not cost very much but might , uh , make things a little easier .
it 's , it 's a nice , uh , relatively nice environment
-- and those are always pretty ,
i think that 'd be neat .
i really do .
good curriculum , uh ,
sometimes when i , if you go out there during the day , you just fry under the sun .
i think that 's unbelievable .
he 's , uh , usually on the ninety-eight to two side ,
and they 'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something .
men do n't treat you like you do n't know anything , generally --
and i think probably it 's pretty important right there .
and pride in themselves , too .
they have to have a certain respect for it .
uh , but , of course , the people who have challenged that or tried to do , on- , have cor- , have not been world powers .
i , i think it 's the murder capital of the country now .
so people think that , that , that they do n't have , um , that , that it does n't matter as much , whereas i think it 's probably just the opposite is true .
and the , seems like the market here 's picking up .
but it was better than it could have been .
-- well , you know , forget that .
and , uh , uh , unfortunately , of course , the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years .
i have to admit , the times is kind of provincial , too .
so they just , do n't name it .
we did fine ,
that is cute .
the place of the seventies .
they , they were feeding us , you know ,
that 's so stupid that you all have two teams .
and i , you know , i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i do n't , i do n't think people could handle it .
it is , it is really scary .
well , well , for one thing there 's not enough money in the school system .
just because people or so , i do n't know , just today people are just so money hungry ,
that there 's no problem with getting them to ,
i think the , the other thing that , that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children .
about quality .
if they were to work in , in a , a , i do n't know , a soup kitchen or something ,
it seems like , it depends on what , what group you happen to be in , what , what you 're going to get and what you 're not going to get
i think , um , this is a tough subject because , uh , when you come from two different parts of the country , uh , the political views are really different .
we would be ,
but , it 's such a lost art .
when you watch them go up , you are just amazed that they do not fall over .
your pricing .
because ,
that 's a good point .
now it 's we 're protecting our lives .
but like i say ,
some sort of program or ,
and people are pretty stable here .
it 's , uh , lot different kind of .
uh , but a lot of the other ones that have , are professional , uh ,
i , i think , uh , i think when we come to a time of recession that it 's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time .
it might not be the same neighborhood , but the same city or county , because then you 're , you 're coming in contact with it .
uh , the , the , the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems , uh , money , dollar , coins , anything like that .
but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do , you know --
and get that youth back .
that 's one thing i guess i could think of .
it 's amazing that people actually ,
so it was really too late to do much .
but nowadays if there are two parents to a family , the mother works just as hard as the father does ,
or even a panel of , of lawyers if , if it got to that point . might be better at than just regular civil people .
but , you know , escort is supposed to have a great track record --
the equipment is very expensive ,
i , i think i , if it 's , if you 're in a field ,
um , but it 's fun .
there 's too much emphasis on test .
you see a lot of , uh , mostly older people though but , that , uh , walk in the malls .
and it goes around ,
they 're pretty .
it was quiet and restful , and , and so beautiful .
and ,
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation .
-- but , we are seasoned minds .
otherwise you got bees and ants
whereas in , in , uh , in dallas here we 've , we 've got , uh , those patterns were well established before , before we really tried to , tried to do the dart .
but a maj , a lot of them do n't do these things even ,
there 's a mild attempt for that ,
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally --
because , there 's no , the answer is not being given to them , in the court system
well , i think we need to do more .
that 's what i think too .
there 's , there 's no question
so if you have someone that , that destroys that value --
but like gun control and , uh , day care an things like that ,
uh , i think it 's important to insure the quality and , and , uh , i do n't know , almost the goodness of character . you know --
and i suspect she could get a large voter turnout .
and then at that point ,
it does n't .
and so , uh , you know , their , their success rate is very high .
well , the sentences are so unbelievable .
you know , that 's not the best way
but i figure that will help me save --
well , if he 's pleased with it , i guess that 's , uh , the bottom line .
and you can get them really cheap .
they do n't know what 's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex .
but , it 's g- , it 's nice to have it when you 're done ,
but by trial and error over the years , i think they got it about as good as they 're going to get it .
and you want to see it hit the green .
that 's , a lot of people do n't have that much space even .
i think , you know , there 's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons
but i , uh , i am totally against that sort of a , uh ,
because if anything ever happens that you do need to , you know , you have excellent credit ,
and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy ,
and , you know , facing that situation , it 's , it 's quite a dilemma .
and for some reason orientals are very , uh ,
it 's been pretty good . some ,
and , uh , so i just think that , i think that god is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership ,
i do n't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea .
it 's too free .
it would have been another planet to kind of take over and , uh , continue on .
or where they are at , you know .
well , they , again the ,
so if i di- , leave it at a dollar ten , people are still going to pay .
well , you are , you are the same age as my daughter , because she just graduated from college this year too .
it 's too bad one of us do n't have some knowledge on this ,
uh , i suppose things , some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening , having a new generation come up that 's more used to it .
when someone is , is on trial for something , you ca n't bring up prior convictions .
it definitely --
well , it will be interesting to see how , over the next year , this all works out because , like on the , uh , grass , i 'm , i know your husband , uh , does n't really like the paper sacks .
where you felt like ,
you got to have a pattern for the body --
it 's more negative , like you said .
and sometimes those twelve people could care less .
i do n't think they really cared about the answer ,
because from what i understand , from some of the guys i know , you know , crime , uh , is punishable , just almost , uh , instantly and --
we 're getting to where ,
we can comment
and , uh , and an awful lot of people are in trouble .
seems very high .
and , uh , it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that , that give you the strength ,
you can do wonderful design .
and another thing is cost .
they do n't understand that to make that work ,
actually make them do something that 's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the , you know , world and not spend so much time sitting around , letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them ,
i , i , i would guess that that portion of the population is massively under represented .
um , i think the people are , are just fed up ,
and , uh , you know , those , those that , you know , come out , you know , fall out of the system , that are , are real trouble ,
uh , my main opinion would be w- , w- , we should not have done it .
they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible ,
well , i think that society has come to a point where they 're not responsible for any of their actions .
and you have to have so many people sharing the same data ,
so again , it never really penalizes ,
of course , uh , you being from new mexico , you 've probably been n- , to washington . especially if you 're , your present location .
but a lot of people , i think , after they thought about it for awhile , and you know , weighed the pros and cons , decided , you know , it 's really not a bad idea unless you 're doing drugs , of course .
i , i , i guess at that point it would turn into a task , ,
because , uh , salary wise i do n't think i 'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large ,
i wish we would have just ,
and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention .
and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things .
it changes
money ,
then you only go there as a last resort .
sentenced to jail for like thirty years they 're out in five
but a lot of it 's because everything society wants , we are supposed to do .
they are never going to let a , a teacher spank a child again .
and what 's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids .
there 's another one he wrote that even sounds better ,
but , but still , you know , it was much better than being shipped to --
oh , a tree mumblex is always something very nice to have .
well , in some ways , i guess , it , it does n't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it , you know . because ,
it 's like , it 's , uh ,
and , you know , they just , they just love kittens .
they 're actually very friendly dogs .
now if things go the way that , that , that they are there , i think that they 'll keep voting ,
i , i do n't consider mexican people in the same category with , uh ,
but they do n't have a national organization of men ,
sounds like we have no conflict .
-- that 's good --
and , uh , so i think it was kind ever interesting .
i think you have to budget those things though .
it , it might have one best picture , too .
i mean , everybody 's got to do it .
i mean that 's nothing .
those things can really upset your budget when they , when they come in .
and , and , and th- , there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at , rea , reasonable and proper .
and they put their pants on the same way ,
it 's just , i mean , everywhere you turn .
and so people should be advised to look for those ,
it 's an interesting , interesting thing you want to do .
an , and we 're kind of their pets .
and , uh , it 's , uh , it 's getting worse .
you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it --
and that does n't definitely make it any better .
well , it 's tough right now for everybody .
some of it ,
and , and all he has to do is hit the ball ,
i , i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- , feeling of second class citizenry , uh , to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote .
but ,
it 's like sticking , uh , an electrode into their pleasure center
that would be wrongful .
they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know ,
well , ye- , that would be , be at the absolute most .
it was , it was real cold .
to me it did n't , does n't seem like we have got much ,
i think their policy with them that though , is , uh ,
not from texas .
besides , they tend to offer ad , adequate vacation , i guess .
there 's a lot of people that think that there 's nothing wrong with mumblex .
but occasionally they do ,
he is --
of course a part of it is technology .
well , i think that is a good show too .
well , i guess if you were having , if you were trying to impress somebody w- , like taking somebody that you had n't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant .
you know , you always be able to get around
i do n't think anybody pays too little .
and i think since then is , is when a lot of the women 's roles have started to change .
and , and you know people really pretty much appreciate it .
i think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items .
and i think one of the big things that you can do is , to increase deterrence is , uh , if someone is found guilty of a , uh , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship .
it does n't make sense .
-- i think that the whole credit card issue , i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts
that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year .
like for petty , for theft and , and stuff like that or manslaughter , you know ,
and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons , the wood , uh , racks which now , basically , you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold , uh , twenty-four bottles .
you 're not sure where to go and vote and all that .
and the people , their moods are extreme , you know .
but until you 've really seen it , it does , it does n't really hit you .
i mean , that kind of thing
but i mean , you do n't have to spend the big money , as far as i 'm concerned to , uh , to win .
see , i , i do n't agree with it .
because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are , they can make a , you know , a much better income .
but if do n't work with them as a parent , i think you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage .
uh , i mean , that , that does n't sound right .
and , uh , i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate the , the pace of learning .
but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from , um , some sort of public service ,
and so many people when they put people in the nurses home , they never see them .
and some of the men are developing , uh , very good too .
because , because a lot of them are , you know , they 're hypocritical .
i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care , you know .
but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean- , or stream or such ,
that 's what they 're called --
and mumblex , but i sort of think about the muslims sort of running around have jihad against themselves .
you know , it 's like they , it seems like they can , their , their army or whatever can , can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do , do the job with , uh , you know , less suffering .
that sounds .
it 's , it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be .
they probably just take it for granted then .
that 's tough .
i think that you , you make of that what you wish
that , that i find very difficult to swallow ,
for someone who does n't garden , i 'd say , that , that 's my biggest recommendation is to ,
i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students , or whatever .
and that ,
it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you 'd be tired ,
i think a lot of it is just , uh , the fact that in the u s you 're so far removed , uh , in a lot of cases from , say , conflicts
that 's a nice state ,
but they do come on kind of late ,
we need enough help here in this country .
you have the house to clean and , you know , the whole business that goes with it .
but , uh , i , you really do need to be very , um , oh , responsible about it
and i , i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home
this --
it 's a nice area .
it was , it was more of a love story --
i was going to say more , it 's more personal for one thing .
so the time goes by , you know , before you realize anything is going on .
and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays , i mean at least they 're getting out and doing it and you know , helping , helping out .
i 'm , i 'm pretty sure it is , because , uh --
and , uh , that , i mean they really are .
but you eventually forget most of it .
they say it 's really horrifyingly scary --
and , uh , one thing , they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing ,
uh , it just seems that , it seems , it seems that they are more comfortable that way .
then all the things you hear about them .
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would .
they really d- , they have to have ,
well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging .
and i think even in the elections , they choose who they 're going to follow and who they 're not ,
so you 're still young .
because it sure is monstrous in this country .
i mean , i- , it really is coming to that because most women now days can not afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them .
those have its pluses and minuses , too .
we really have ,
and i think that 's kind of why they , they were making the riskier loans ,
uh , and prohibition did n't stop it and did n't do anything really --
i think , i think they realized we would probably never push him out
so , they 've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then ,
so i think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units .
and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on , peace on both sides .
so , uh , uh , that would be a beautiful relationship .
it may be in the future that men , you know , some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves .
well , they 're struggling with it .
the , uh , swimming , they say , uses more muscles than any other exercise with ,
that 's certainly ,
i mean there 's , again there 's no consistency .
they 're great for an office
and i think that 's probably a little over kill for this day and age .
well ,
i do n't think they have any more money than any of the other countries ,
at least you have n't thrown out all the work they 've done for months and months and months and months .
but i think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field .
and then they get out .
even if you want to say home , you really ca n't .
and i think it 's because they 've gone since they were real little ,
and , i really ,
i mean ,
-- but , but they love it .
and , uh , certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that , you know , they , they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant
and so , it 's just kind of strange , you know ,
certainly not .
but they try every year
uh , i think they should have more programs like that .
um , looking back , like maybe some of the things that i know now , i , i 'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives .
so they think , well , you know , why vote .
i mean there , there 's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could , you could use for landfill . mumblex .
i think that , uh , hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it ,
without a doubt .
-- that looks really good too .
and , i think that 's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute , an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters ,
in this sort of wild west scenario , you 're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature .
so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that .
they have nice plans
and ,
you know , you do n't want to ,
but , uh it 's real nice for carrying around our kids and others
it 's , uh , you know , it , it 's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically
and we 're all going to have to do it .
i just need to , put the old nose to the grindstone ,
it 's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere .
that 's true .
i guess like , like they 're nothing , i guess , nothing is as awful as abortion
and i think it does .
it 's more they 're not enforcing the death penalty itself .
and that is sad , because , i think the health profession is one of the most critical ,
at that time , anyway , that was still when things were ,
and it 's , it 's very hard , because when you get used to two salaries , it 's very hard to , to cut back to one .
if they do n't do , if they do n't , if they do n't pull it in and start doing something , i think they 're really going to have to i think .
they , they were lucky enough to have some oil , what , ten years ago , an ,
that 's not an easy part to play , i , i do n't think .
it 's , it 's --
well , i do n't think there 's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they ,
. well , that 's kind of scary .
you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in .
i mean they are the ones ,
so , he , he would have a heck , or she would have a heck of a lot of power , you know , if used wrongly .
and then there are people who catch .
and they both have holy sanctions .
there , there 's something about having a place to live ,
actually , what the positions that they found outside of the company were much , much better than the ones that they currently had inside .
and you know , they 're ,
and , uh , you know , you 're not going to get anymore abe lincolns --
you have to ,
huh . well , may , maybe now things are calming down again .
uh , it 's , it 's kind of , uh , you know , it 's kind of hard to explain .
but you know , i would n't be surprised if thing 's like that did n't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones .
but when it was , the real slapstick moments , him versus the criminals kind of thing , it just sort of lost the human element --
it is having a good moral background .
i think it 's something completely new .
that empty nest syndrome is going to set in , i guess .
and , and we wo n't see them back for another two or three years .
and as we educate them individually what they can do , people become more aware of the things in industry too that , that are causing problems
but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years ,
but i did n't think teachers should , you know .
that serves a kind of if they 're , i guess , uh ,
so if you terminate him , that 's a loss of value .
i think they 've made a lot more chances .
and then the , the houses are all , most of the houses are pretty nice ,
and the only , uh , branch in the armed fo- , services that seems willing to do that is the air force .
it 's , uh , it 's a scary thing to know that , uh , you just do n't know what people are doing --
well , that sounds like fun .
i guess we 've kind of covered it .
and you can go the opposite direction and , uh , over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you , which do n't belong in the , in , at least in my opinion , in the work place ,
your state 's a good example
it 's , it 's ,
that 's more , even more commercialized for of --
i think it would be kind of stressful .
well , i bet you 're , you 're , you may dress differently , then , for that .
you know , secretaries are n't , are n't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something .
but , uh , you know , then the kids kind of suffer .
i think that 's a really good way to handle it , because that way , if you , if you paid off every month , you never have to worry about , well , how much do i have to pay these guys , you know , this month , you know .
i guess the one that really got me too was that , uh ,
if , if you do n't watch it there , then you 're going to hear somebody else 's canned , uh , report , somebody else 's view about it
innocent people could do that ,
i think it 's like , uh , back east .
i think you can legislate
so some of the things are not as , quite as , uh , adaptable .
but , uh , i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases .
well , they 're probably hardy , harder to take care of
but there are , they need to put more limits on them .
it was so good .
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do .
because i think yu- , you know , you grow closer .
basically , the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway
i , i , you know , i think that 's probably , un- , unless we can afford it ,
mumblex just get one .
uh , but , you know , other , other than that , with , with both my kids being under two , it 's real hard --
we would n't have thought of crossing a teacher when we --
it 's just some of those women that come up there looking like arnold schwarzenegger 's sister just does n't get it .
i mean , that 's --
a lot better .
uh , not as good as it would have been --
then you go to work
and it 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know .
it , it , it really works that way .
i mean ,
i mean they 're sleeping in different bed every night
but ,
but --
at least --
it 's so rare
it was just all legitimate kind of , uh , film .
and i know people would be willing to do more , like saving their newspapers and that , if they had a place to take them .
but i think it 's getting more and more like ,
i think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on .
once you get up --
have more of an active role in taking care of children , more of an active role in taking care of the home .
he always got to change history is what it is .
about , uh , like you say , using them , yo- ,
and , uh , that 's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for ,
sometimes dental costs can be , um , just about as expensive , if not more ,
it 's going back towards , you know ,
and let 's see how we can get rid of the problem , you know ,
it 's a good game though .
but , uh , i really think it 's , it 's a u n issue ,
but , you know , i think they can test all they want for drugs you know ,
or good that it ended as soon as it did .
it 's becoming not necessarily good music , just popular music , you know .
well , i mean , i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served .
everybody that has , that has stood there ,
that 's the thing to do ,
that ki- , the kids maybe on the average get , uh , something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents .
i mean , i think life is just music ,
and i do n't think they ever care to .
that 's at , that one wo n't your sides .
and they , they really had done some good , some good work .
that 's that 's usually the basic criteria .
i think it 's great .
they 're not really sure of what they are . i do n't think .
because it really is exciting ,
the , the market seems to just be growing , too .
but then again , maybe they should be there
and a few people in the news that bring it to us --
but anyway , but i guess you 're right though it has been real hot ,
it was n't that bad ,
that 's interesting .
just a nice comfortable ride .
but the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent , uh , very wise in money matters and have ta- , have taken over a lot of businesses ,
they get pretty expensive .
the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule --
i mean people who do n't go to college become adults in other ways .
and they do not have any , uh , ego , uh , problems that they are fighting .
you really do n't want to dress up unless you , you , uh , have a job
but , uh , we 've got a budget deficit that just wo n't go away unless it gets seriously addressed .
i think it 's well worth it .
mainly because , i , a lot of it has to do , i think with more women working --
and it 's scary ,
but i guess overall , because i guess i 'm not associated with what ghetto schools , and , and , uh , and , uh , rural school systems are like , i , i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure .
well , anyway , i just think that , you know , the united states policy over there ,
and if it , if it had passed ,
the other thing is , it 's , it 's all very well to give money to help people , other people ,
and then they , uh , they were n't getting the draft picks
it 's not .
that is very nice to see young people .
you know , one parent go one direction
he 's such a , he 's about a half hot head anyway , such a temper .
at least they 're starting , you know .
i do n't think so .
well , i think we 've probably talked long enough
and that 's quite fun .
but it 's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who 'll sign it and let you do it --
it 's , uh , it 's easy to keep up on current event- , you know --
i 'm not sure they need to be , you know , paid , you know ,
does n't quite feel as good .
but , you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that 's mumblex been laying around ,
well , people they , in general , are just getting married a lot later .
and that 's about the only way that i can , that i can do it .
i mean we 've got loads of foreign students --
well , i , i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately , that i think there are some occupations that they should , such as the health field , the transportation field , uh ,
which is about the developmental level that , you know , you need to be at to read those things ,
e- , even in some families some people talk a little bit different .
i mean , they , they , they think they 're getting ,
she 's not as good as she use to be
-- i suspect their opinions would change very quickly .
uh , a huge amount of what you hear on , about the seventy-five dollar hammers ,
the stamina that you must , you know , draw from yourself to deal with it .
um , especially when they finish all the construction out here --
but i do n't think he 's really been a super star for them .
-- or is how you end up .
and i think that is only right though , really .
it is , um ,
i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care --
i think that the , we still have a long way to go .
but you will at least double that amount
but , that takes too much planning .
and they 're , and they 're destroying us ,
i , i believe it 's any capital crime related to drugs .
you ca n't dance to it ,
i think that i should have a right to own a handgun .
it was a beautiful animal ,
but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do .
but i 'm sure ,
and he 'll cover up for you
it really is .
if somebody does n't do something .
you know i bet that 's why we have some friends that eat only ,
i think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident .
i mean , there 's got to be a different way .
and ,
you 're going to pay twenty , twenty-five in interest charges .
the only problem that we have and that 's all over the whole world is ozone --
it 's , it 's really hard , hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that are different .
you know . lincoln is still as big as it always has been
and , uh , there 's less , uh , friction involved in relationships when you add that skill --
the idea is to use their money .
but they 're running under the assump- ,
but ,
it 's a little bit strange for me .
but i feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our , uh , car manufacturers have for a while .
and they do n't have the , um , a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world .
so --
but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted
they 're the exact same thing .
and , uh , they 're not , uh , too inclined to do something as aggressive as that .
so , i think we find out what 's happening in the city , uh , on a fairly frequent basis , over a , over a gin and tonic sort of thing .
but , you know , it seems like we pay the state ,
because they , they know that you 're biased .
you obviously are , are not an exercise buff or else you 'd be out there doing it .
they ca n't change it .
they 're going to get it from us .
so honestly if there is , was a well perceived war , world wide this was it .
i 'm worth a lot just for what i do every day ,
you start letting that happen and they go down
that was , that was a good movie .
and so that makes real sense , that that 's , um , when it was written .
sometimes those are the best ones ,
there probably are , you know ,
people would rather , uh , increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them .
i believe we 've pretty much summed everything up .
you , uh , you 're obviously aware of that , um .
that 's the thing ,
you have a very , um , very ,
i think in the short run it is expensive .
you know , stuff like that has happened with education and with other things that you hear about
and you 're , you get mixed signals
probably know him if i saw him .
usually if a movie is good , once is enough .
that , oh , that 's horrible ,
-- and then you 're stuck
even , even what you recycle ,
they 're the best kind .
and i think the real problem with this , this weird conversion , yo- , you see signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and , you know , whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour , you know ,
so the school systems can improve , both in standing up for splitting classes , you know , having learning dis- , learning , slow , slow children in slow classes , but not mixing them with behavior problems .
as much as i did n't like school when i was going through it ,
and , uh , but , uh , we 'll need an unanimous verdict
you just --
but i know that asking the question over and over and over again is n't working
and it may be a survival thing --
it 's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and leers , w- , years before you do execute them or whatever because it 's , has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to --
uh , that 's , uh , self improvement ,
i think it 's still based on the old model of ,
he was pretty good ,
it looked like u n l v may have had more , uh , talent ,
it 's pretty busy .
i guess if you care , or if your wife , your future wife , uh , gives you a reason to care --
course , when we get an ice storm , that 's not too much fun .
i , i , i feel that is an invasion of privacy
just to keep them going .
it 's an industry that 's still a cottage industry --
i do n't think that 's right , if they 're , especially if they 're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning .
i guess that what the scale now is , it 's zero for , uh , for a complete ,
especially with this one , you know , it kind of goes up and down .
it 's kind of hard to , to get an even keel on that .
if you went in for a certain crime , there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have ,
but i think that , um , they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier .
-- and , uh --
but the system does n't allow for the corrections .
it 's really neat .
i do n't think they should do that .
perhaps they are , because they 're , they 're ,
and it 's enjoyable , too .
i , i 've kind of gathered lately that , uh , maybe their information is not just only related to business .
i suspect that the pub- , that there 's going to have to be a lot of pressure , uh , come to bear on the companies that deal with it
they say , well , we 're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these , um , the , the recycle center , you have to deal with the can and then you have to , to recycle it ,
it would be tough to do ,
well , baker is really not very much pro israel .
and , you know , we 're not typically talking about big dollars
i think that , uh , you know , that there needs to be a way that , you know , once someone has gone through , you know , a trial , i do not know how to fix it .
i guess it was because ,
and they 're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such ,
all i know about that woman is that she 's an in , incredible marketeer .
and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out
and , uh , not everyone votes at the same place .
well , i guess , although , i , well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is ,
-- and , uh , especially when somebody 's , uh , planning lunch for you and they know what , what 's good for you ,
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that .
and it 's , you know , it 's a game that you do n't ,
but i think we need to have the one line , uh , uh , veto so that they do n't have to spend so much time doing everything .
i mean , i , i , i would expect their own problems would keep them away from us for a while ,
when they 're , when they 're little it 's almost easier to leave them because when they 're three and they 're cry ,
in fact , the , the guy that was on , the weatherman on channel eight worked for me , oh , long time ago ,
you get so many coming in ,
most of the time .
if they 're associated with a college or a university , they 're usually a pretty good bet .
he probably just went right down into a tunnel .
and --
but again , i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers .
and i 'm sure that , you know , it 's the lawyers ,
they do n't see it as supporting the folks , the people .
um , and i do n't , you know , we could n't do that with a dog .
you kn , you know , it 's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on .
but , it does seem
but , uh , i think taxes generally are unfair
they send you someplace that there 's a lot of bugs mumblex .
our air- , our national road system , system of highways ,
and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it .
but , uh , they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit
later you 're ,
see , it does n't do anything .
if you 're lucky .
maybe you still can do that .
when you are that rich , uh , you always get into the paper , whatever , if you have a family problem , whatever .
um , but it was , it was really good . um ,
you know , in the large city that if the next recycling , if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away --
i think , though , that now that we 're finally starting to get over the fears and the , uh , oh , i do n't know , the guilt that we had out of , uh , challenger ,
that 's just sensible on their part .
and , uh ,
and maybe that 's a , an issue with a , a lot of people .
and they do things that are , you know , just like the , uh ,
-- and , and probably you 're right .
and therefore --
-- or is it the f b i .
right ,
what is it ,
oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw ?
what else do i do .
what 's the word i 'm looking for ,
three , yeah ,
what else .
what 's it called ,
no ,
um . trying to think .
let 's see what ,
and , um , mumblex i 'm trying to think .
what did i make that night .
oh , that 's right
um , let 's see ,
uh ,
um , let 's see .
well , let 's see .
good question .
wait a minute ,
and let me see ,
well , i 'll tell you .
when i was on vacation , um , between semester break and summer , you know , on semester break between spring and summer --
um , well , it depends ,
i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so ,
my roommates are ,
i was trying to think if there was anything else .
not for that ,
let 's see .
well , i , i have n't taught in iowa ,
let 's see ,
uh , let 's see , uh ,
well , let 's see ,
uh , let me see ,
but um , but let 's see ,
i was going to ask you something else .
that 's not what , uh ,
well , i come from a family that was very large in bell county --
but i 've taught in utah ,
i just forgot the title of it .
uh , darn ,
well , let 's see ,
uh , i 'll tell you ,
well , it 's actually , uh ,
and , uh , what else .
well , uh , now , i have n't done much fishing here in texas , uh , because i moved from ohio ,
i was trying to think , uh ,
um , well , i really ca n't say for certain , truth be known .
well , it 's going to be interesting .
oh , uh , let 's see ,
um , they , they were outside my marriage ,
uh , think what else i can say about that . uh ,
so let 's see , um ,
so you --
t v , uh ,
uh , uh , let 's see
uh , let 's see ,
well , see , this is it ,
but , i do n't know .
i 'm trying to think of his name .
let 's see ,
well , for the neighborhood i 'm in ,
well , it depends again if we 're talking about , uh ,
so you can approximately ,
use a lot of discernment .
you should n't be watching them with your little girl ,
we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste ,
you do n't have to ever use it if you do n't want to .
i ca n't wait to get out of high school .
we 're going to , we 're going to redo the patio , you know ,
that 'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money .
we 'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps ,
it 's too much of a hassle ,
let 's go do it ,
but they would n't know what they 're doing .
at midnight , tonight we all switch over or anything .
what is your problem .
today we 're just going to dedicate ourself to watching golf --
i 'm having fun ,
-- hey , we think this guy can really make some changes
uh , you either need a job or you do n't .
you do n't want those . mumblex .
after two years we 'll cut it down seven to seventy fiv- , you know , seventy-five percent .
we 're not taking that .
and you give them an f on something that does n't seem that bad to me .
so why , why am i waiting , you know ,
and even if it 's not environmentally safe , who cares , you know .
oh it is , it 's a candy ,
you know , i like what he says ,
recycle , well , if it 's a problem , forget that .
i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about . you know ?
well , okay , .
you know , armed forces could have them ,
that 's just the way it 's constructed .
and we are going to consider ourselves against , in war ,
and here 's what we expect of you .
there 's nothing that he has that , that you could go after .
render unto caesar 's what is caesar 's .
and then we 're going to go and vote , you know .
and ,
what did i do to myself
and here , those of us that dumavra power , which is our power company ,
i 'm leaving the big city , mom ,
and they dra- , suck me into these arguments and ,
let 's go grab it , you know ,
and you already want to replace him .
you ca n't be pregnant and have cats .
so it does n't matter , you know .
you bring this ,
did you feel , uh , rewarded while you were doing it .
let 's put into this plan , this plan ,
and you 're absolutely nuts .
how about --
and you do n't ever touch it unless i 'm here ,
you know , maybe ,
so i better not go .
my best friends are lawyers .
this happens all the time .
and it 's like jesus christ , you know ,
why did n't he pay his taxes ? you know .
it 's broken .
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves ,
so please end your conversation .
you 'd learn at this rate
and she did it backwards in high heels .
but then we , you know , ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits
i would love to hold her .
i will not .
and now you 're singing all this stuff that , does n't matter what you , what you sing or what you record ,
and you were great ,
it 's not recyclable .
and then , you know , you 're trying to make the , the wave smooth
whatever you call easy , i 'll do it , you know .
what do you want in a college .
fine .
well , i did n't tell you what year .
and let 's go to war for that way
i did n't want to bother you .
and just bring the kids in the family
what kind of car will you buy next
well , we 're not going to hire you if you smoke .
i 'm not the one who writes the orders .
well , there 's , you know , a hundred thousand per year affected by this one
do n't you get , do n't you , uh , get bored and not have anything to do ,
and if you do that when do you do it
-- we better have him do s- , do something .
you should n't have left it there .
`` i do n't know . ''
and we 'd just let you go .
they always follow the heifer . ''
thank you .
look , i do n't want the credit card ,
and i have n't used it since i got out of college ,
and each one works in one part of town
and then this other one 's only a tenth of that ,
and if you commit this crime , you will be in prison for the rest of your life .
i could help the poor people better by myself than they 're doing .
and would n't i like to have her money --
and , and where are the engineers coming from ?
well , whose going to really make them .
you know , did we really protect them ?
just your child , and , or do they just put any child in any crib --
. and you think , my goodness , why did i think i was doing better .
how will i dust this thing ?
i mean , what 's , what good is that ?
is that right ?
what do you believe in ,
but who knows now .
will you , uh .
it 's not all that long ago is it .
where to start .
then , then , then , then is it worth it at all .
do you , uh ,
well you know what i was hoping ?
is n't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time .
but what did we do .
uh , why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they 've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t , or tried to , or done their very , you know , given their best effort at doing that .
do we drug test everybody that comes in
but , but who knows how it 's supposed to all end .
if , if you 're going to go camping , who wants to deal with bugs
but you know , you know what 's really funny ?
but , so are they willing to ,
because i wonder if that means that if you do n't do it --
so ,
you know , so it 's like , what are you going to do , you know ?
why should i go out of my way when it does n't matter .
is n't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction ?
wh , what about the argument where , where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a , a more serious capital crime ?
you know .
you know , what has , you know , has , has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who 's above average is now gifted ?
and , and what does it cost these people over there , you know .
so you 're going do i want a di- , a green lawn or a muddy feet ,
and that 's why , you know , i 'm like , okay , what 's my role in this thing , , you know ,
who has time ?
i keep wondering sometimes why do i do this because it 's so frustrating .
are you willing to compromise a little and , and pay , pay some , take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education .
how many cups equal that ?
ca n't you , ca n't you put ,
-- uh , how can you do anything about a problem besides if you do n't know about it ?
how do you think we 're going to pay for it ?
why not get the work out of the people .
-- oh , is it campari 's or something ?
-- but then what movie is n't anymore .
what difference does it make .
because i , you know , if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death , how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of ex- , execution ?
i 'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world 's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years .
i mean , what does this have to do with getting , you know , a computer science degree or whatever , you know ?
wh , uh , w ,
what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by , uh , bulgaria and ,
how did you know to choose this subject , tonight .
but the , but the question is , you know , if somebody offered you , you know , a thousand dollars a day to , to grow something in your backyard , would you do it .
why did you do it that way .
why ,
right ,
is n't that a fact ?
right ?
is n't it .
do n't they ?
did you ?
right .
huh ?
down by big bend ?
so outrageous .
get rid of him .
be everything , be supermom ,
very limited .
get around .
oh , and he hears them or something
basic .
there 's no restriction though .
and texas instruments .
or if somebody gets sick .
still be on .
we cast off .
after the war .
that much stuff .
take them for walks ,
or , the quality of their product .
disposal is a problem .
and glass .
something .
or a dependent of one .
other things .
bore ?
metropolitan ,
role ?
it 's like nothing to them .
it 's safe .
but you never know .
or what it was .
the , the extended loan payment for your car .
hart ?
you kind of goes into your privacy
leonard mumblex .
corrode .
that area ,
to get them on their ,
not a lot of gravy --
one thing .
pay fifteen ,
personnel , or something ,
oh , mumblex driver .
not department ,
not all that common .
it 's hard .
slow down a little bit .
and then they changed the game .
daughter ,
than you ,
landfills .
those people that try to do everything .
because he ca n't do it .
private organizations .
then bring her back home at night .
are so involved .
that 's , you did , that 's what you did .
scope .
particularly , if you 're hungry .
just hard finding the time --
put in the middle .
all their time .
h m o .
make it difficult enough .
as far as ge , yeah , getting doctors and all that stuff , yeah .
making time for it .
someone did ,
a ring at all .
more areas where they would pick it up .
because of that ,
you had to do something .
lawn ?
more taxes you pay .
how are we doing in recycling ?
how about the injection ,
like , what about , like , uh ,
how about you ?
so , how you like new jersey ?
what do you think going to happen to the rangers ?
what do you use ?
um , what do you think of the , uh , l a raiders ,
how about yourself ?
and how 'd that go ?
how about yours ?
so , uh , what do you think ? .
what about you ?
how do you go about getting one of those a catalogs ?
what did you think of the world series ?
how about you ?
how did you like africa ?
what do you think about robin hood ?
how about yourself ?
what have you seen ?
how about your community ?
how do you dress ?
how do you feel about credit cards ?
how do you feel about it ?
so what do you think about it ?
uh , so , what do you think , uh , about putting the elderly in a nursing home ?
how about you ?
but , uh , uh , how do you feel about the , uh , about the jury system itself ?
so what do you think of , of owning a home as opposed to , to renting somebody else 's ?
wh- , d- , what do you plan , have planned for your yard ?
what about you ?
so , uh , what do you think about it ?
what about people from , um , pennsylvania .
how do you feel about haitian immigration ?
what 's your opinion ?
so , uh , so what do you , what do you think in the short term we should be doing to , to improve it ?
what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business ?
what do you do ?
well , michael , what do you think about , uh , funding for aids research ?
what are your feelings on it ?
well , what 's your views on it ?
well , what , what about the taxes on cigarettes ?
well , how , how do you feel about the immigration laws ?
how about you ?
now how do you mean that ?
what do you think about pensions ?
what do you think about that ?
what do you , what do you think is causing all this ,
uh , what 's your feeling about that ?
how about you ?
and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want
uh , what kind of crime problem do you usually run into ?
why ,
how about yourself ?
well , what , uh , what do you all do for camping ?
what have you got up there ?
well , how do you feel about trial by jury ?
has , what 's been your voting experience ?
what ,
so , how do you feel about capital punishment ?
how is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the american flag ?
how about your family ?
how about you ?
well , how does this grab you ? how did this grab you ?
so he had his own backyard garden , too .
and , uh , we seem , we seem to have , um ,
most of the , those kind of plants just , are just barely staying alive , let alone make flowers .
i have n't , not an opportunity to see that , uh ,
in march .
so we 've got our cowboys here
well , that 's what i 'm telling my father now .
so we have a little shindig with them .
and he has finished everything except the chimney .
but , um , you know , just like software is only given out to customers ,
one week , .
uh , my children and i , uh , i started a thing where i read a book with them before they went --
but , otherwise , uh , i generally ,
i , i ca n't identify them either .
and i like to bicycle , too .
it 's just to get , uh , motiv , motivated again ,
so it 's mostly indoor sports , i think , in the winter .
it 's funny ,
we 've gone out to , um , uh , a place in western pennsylvania called falling water .
well , uh , we sort of started doing it years and years ago
well , i do n't read all that much for enjoyment .
well ,
but , i also get , of course , lots of references to neat stuff to read about .
so i , yeah , i , i was really happy that i was able to do that .
we 're from more , uh , from sort of towards the shore , central --
i think we 're going the opposite direction .
mumblex so , well , i guess we 're talking about the experiment .
boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will , uh , police a , uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee- ,
i was a season ticket holder of the cowboys for years ,
physically , i mean
and then we write down each , each time we spend something , we write down in a book
actually they say that you 're wasting fertilizer --
uh , but it does n't really change my clothing style .
i , i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend , simply because i used to get it during the week --
especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries .
got our businesses and , and , and our life in line , how to manage credit cards , how to put away , say for , you know , money markets and this kind of thing .
and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day ,
and e d s is very particular about this , hair cuts ,
and , there 's this montessori school that 's nearby
i had a friend whose brother did steroids
it came out a couple of years ago
but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old ,
i 've never paid any attention to voting .
and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies .
they had entertainment sometimes
i ca n't ,
we ended up watching it for a couple of hours . zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea- , watching it some more .
that was the only thing we did n't , you know , putting the ceiling up and things like that
it , it 's interesting ,
oh , and he 's always got a smile .
and it was beautiful
they have built up one mountain .
so , uh , we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other .
they go , you know ,
an- , and usually it has been when we have gone , it has been nice .
they , they became ,
but , uh --
but , uh , first and foremost the bills .
i 'm , i work for t i .
let 's see , i 've done a quilt for our baby
so i got a , uh , book of his short stories ,
wound up in administration ,
i have three cats and a dog .
there 's this one sign 's kind of funny .
it really does , except when you have to fill them up
because that was back in the seventies .
it 's , there 's always something to do
and that 's about it , you know .
i could go out and debate george bush better than i see any democrat doing it .
but , uh , i 'll bet we 've done , we 've done at least five minutes .
i though , oh , this wo n't take long at all .
my garden is shaped that i can ,
i , i just ca n't imagine --
there may be bottles as well , but like beer cans , soda cans and what not
you can have your phone number unlisted ,
they 're in college or just out of college
i was n't .
and , uh , i really liked working on it . uh , cause it was pretty easy too .
no memory .
camping or , uh , motor home is nice , uh , travel trailer , pop up ,
he- , he 'll be three in august .
and the boys are in baseball .
uh , we have not camped in any of those places ,
and i 've , i think the most exercise i 've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids ' questions .
huh . see i got mine in ,
but , uh , i , you know , i , when i was , when i was going to school ,
and when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row .
but there really is only about a half a dozen , uh , things
-- and they were showing people crying --
i would love that .
that 's , that 's our pro- , our , our daughter 's problem , you know , 'cause when you , when you get out on the road like that and it 's just long stretches , you know , where they just have to sit , you know .
i love it .
and he 's going to be in also .
but i ca n't remember exactly what goes through their head when they 're doing that .
so it 's actually tough this year ,
and when you go to a football game in colorado that 's , you know , there 's snow
well , i like cats .
uh , the , i guess the worst problem i ever had with , with a credit card though was , um , i got a , an item on my bill that i had never purchased .
and ,
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the , the living , more or less ,
and , uh , i was very pleased with all three games , because kansas , uh ,
she was making like , i do n't know what she was making , forty-five dollars a month i think .
and , uh , well , the first week , i think , a lot more people were doing it .
not really .
they , they dress pretty good , i would say
it ca n't last seven years
but , uh , that gets old too in a very short order ,
and i have n't gotten a one of them yet when i 've called .
he was a little surprised .
i hope that ,
i mean there are forty people --
i wish i could do something like that ,
they said they can just about guarantee that there , that , that would happen if you did that .
so he knew the feeling because my other son is at amherst which is --
but she loves it .
i liked your idea too , there .
we 're pretty excited .
i would buy something ,
when i only do something one , two or three times i 'm hardly an expert on it ,
they could go visit them during the day .
as far as the murderers , and people that commit rape and things like that , i 'm not sure what 's right ,
i just love ,
it was , i guess i did n't realize what a luxury it was at the time .
and these are the big mamas , i . e . sons , uh , hewlett packards , uh --
those are the only , only issues we ever fight about .
there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night , which ,
because that 's where t i is .
and , and , uh , my father bought this , uh , my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care
that 's when i was in the elementary school years
uh , on rutherford .
the supporting actor , he was good ,
-- and it was smooth
and the wind and everything was incredible .
we , we wake up to television news and , uh , uh , shower and dress , and whatever to that ,
what i try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good --
hey , listen , if i had my way , i would n't pay my taxes .
so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something , that the philosophy of greek mythology or something that actually approached this , or , um , one literature , you know , or a , a literature course or , just all sorts of different perspectives on it ,
uh , in general most of them , uh , people doing this are t i -ers ,
it had a fireplace .
i 've heard the name
and , uh , it resulted in , in a few people leaving ,
we 're at aetna with an , uh , ex- ,
and they 've quoted statistics that i just about , my throat just about fell into my toes .
you know , it 's , uh , it looks good , you know --
i do n't do a whole lot of it , um , at this exact point in my life , um , because i have two teenage boys ,
but i do n't know whether , it , it , research will go on .
and i went to see my mother ,
-- and , you know , they have to be doing something constantly .
you 're in plano also , huh ?
so i --
and it 's something i can do still .
and i really liked both of them .
so , um , that 's something that i 'm probably going to be looking at --
the christ united methodist church in plano .
so , i , i , i like to read the , the children 's books ,
we 've done it a couple of times
and he said i ca n't believe that you 're still getting such a kick out of that movie .
but i enjoyed it .
i went to their concert last year when they were here .
but last year he made mumblex
and then they came back in the second half
definitely .
i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never --
uh , we were across from that big bus station ,
and , while he showers , it 's so hilarious .
there was , uh , several other companies ,
that 's pretty much what i do .
so , uh , they never played together or anything .
not with the sense that it was , uh , uh , chore or something that i was having to do ,
so that 's , that 's been their summer money
i , i 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that .
-- and it was , it 's really , it 's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are
well , my husband works at t i over on central .
you just say , well look read the miles per hour one ,
uh , mumblex . it is very interesting , uh , subject ,
but my daughter and her husband were out of town
and , um , but it 's , it 's a very beautiful part , very interesting historically , of course , which was my interest mumblex art history .
-- but there 's like two fellows from , uh , brooklyn ,
i 'll have to try that out because i had heard that north carolina was sort of like that .
nissan .
and that 's , lord , that 's , uh , over five months worth .
and then bucknell in mid-state pennsylvania .
all my income goes for things like luxuries ,
and frankly , i , i do n't understand why a state does n't have those records available anyway .
-- and then , you know , we put i guess it 's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account .
well , uh , pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard .
you know , uh , i- , i guess it talked about all types of pollution .
and they did n't have any coverage under my name
oh , i generically have , you know , millions of hobbies .
-- uh , no problem at all .
i did n't build up muscle , though ,
i have three children , um , two , two who are in regular school , uh , eleven year old , an eight year old ,
but i , i , i , i have to say , yes , i 'm , you know , i 'm encouraged by the way it 's going . uh ,
my husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work .
i , we have three teenage daughters .
and i do n't know what we pay for his card ,
and , uh , i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals
some of the other people , the older people organized it .
i would estimate seventy pounds .
i got to say ,
but a lot of the times , i , you know , i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper ,
they just score just enough points ,
i do n't like to have to have to pull grass --
of course what i used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops --
but we struggled
-- and i , you know , i do n't know why they both made him do that --
indeed , i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening .
that 's , that 's where the speech program is . uh ,
uh , i , i really enjoy it ,
so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports ,
and i , i 'm a broadcast journalist ,
and you 're not supposed to eat those because they 're bad for you .
we , we 're very similarly aged ,
i do n't recall that they have any female anchors
it 's like , i 'm not standing in a mound , though .
so , he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to .
and it got better than , i think twenty-two , twenty-three miles a gallon .
i play in several symphony orchestras
they did .
well i , i used to lift weights an awful lot , and stuff like that .
well , as soon as i get my quarters in , i 'm ,
i , i do some sewing , mostly out of necessity .
for me i just , i just , cou , would n't want to do that .
yo- , you 're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything ,
but , uh , my favorite is the , the indulgent ones , where we go off and , and , uh , see places that have interested me since i was a kid ,
it is .
but if everyone did we 'd probably have over a hundred
and they seem to come back year after year ,
uh , well , i read everything , uh , i guess , uh ,
and then let it sit on the bottom ,
and what you do to make it , you take the shell and you spread the beans on first ,
i guess , i can wait another month
my husband did too .
just like , uh , really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed
well , you know , somebody elected that recently .
then he reminded me , but
we fax --
but i like to bang on the keyboards once in a while .
i have enough of that in my own life .
but i mean fall ,
matter of fact , that , that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa- ,
but every friday night they 'll go home , you know , straight from work
i do n't know anybody that actually supports abortion ,
but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant .
and then they start a drug problem .
and he helped me
i think we are going to do , uh , another bathroom ,
and it 's going to be interesting to see if carl sagan and his billions and billions of stars ,
we 've got a good chinese restaurant in town .
and some of the , the better parts of the metroplex , the , the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools .
you just could n't believe that they would , that they would be mean , and , and , and , and drop bombs and kill people ,
my husband was in the service ,
you know , that 's one meal ,
you talk about spicy ,
you know keeping busy with everything else going on ,
but i 've heard that it 's real good .
and we do miss that .
and i never would want to work for him .
you know , it 's , it 's sort of like hollywood in a way because there 's , there 's favorite haunts for southerners and things like that .
because , there 's one that always wears a suit .
i have a solution , you see .
and so they have a ,
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years i think is what --
this guy is up for the death penalty .
it 's quite different than it was before ,
if they are losing money , then they 're going to raise rates .
it 's bright steps in lewisville .
but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it 's not , it 's not
so i say if she wants to go out and buy something , i never argue with her , because she 's real good at , you know , sort of mumblex .
and about this time of year there is , it starts getting a little old ,
i like shopping .
might have been better .
we are just south of that little bridge , back-up on the hill in the trees there ,
if it was a customer presentation then that would be different .
before we found the shopping malls that 's what we did .
just a baby-sitter in a home .
you know when he quits at being active , he will go into , you know --
but i just have never been a stallone fan .
i do n't ,
i can , i can , i know what you mean .
and that kind of interrupted the game ,
i keep wanting to get up to ,
and , uh , it helped me out because i learned --
um , at t i they 're doing recycling .
you know , occasionally , some ice skating will come on , on a sunday or during the olympics --
i mean , there must be some , some , something ,
but she has adjusted beautifully .
and she tries to make me feel really guilty .
and , uh , he 's really getting too old to take care of it .
well , the first time it 'd probably would have taken me forever ,
i 'm --
well , that 's what my husband ,
it was actually , it was put on by the power companies and , about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was ,
i- , it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the vietnam vets did not have , from the people or the administration , either one .
but , uh , i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time .
but , for the most part , i try , i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they 're up .
he jumped off the balcony actually , of a second story apartment .
but they spread out to cover more area
and we , we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one .
that was our last tour , in michigan .
i have children even ,
well , part of eighty-four to eighty-six i should say .
-- and then , uh , the tollway is called the dallas north tollway .
it 's like , you know , if we can do it once every six months , we 're doing well .
i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes .
and then i have a sister that lives in austin .
and they were really just going on epidemiological , uh ,
and now it 's really growing
when i was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired , you know .
the topic is to discuss the , uh , sources where i receive news .
and they 'd lived in this , this old ,
and i know people that have done that .
i just started doing this
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime
and --
and they started doing this , like in the early , or in about the middle seventies .
and then when it gets wet , you know , you do n't even want to get out in the yard ,
i got too much weight on right now .
he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up .
that was kind of a funny movie with , uh , richard dreyfuss and bill murray .
i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all .
and then , uh , he talked about a van ,
and then they sell it to them .
and so now that i do have one , i just do n't automatically turn it on --
so , i 've got a p c and a work station at work
-- and he 's trying to find it ,
i never heard mumblex ,
the city is going to leave , uh , receptacles at people 's home .
its , its mouth was full of hooks .
and so , they 're all kind of local and close ,
i know .
actually another one that i , a question i would have is ,
and you --
we have , well , we like a lot of gasoline credit cards ,
well , um , w- , we do a lot of things with them , you know ,
and they let you know
and they said , sure that 's no problem , but , you know , why do n't we consolidate your bills ,
i just miss that ,
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with th- , with the jury .
and i could n't think of anything at all .
-- but we 're still fighting bugs , and ready to change some of the , the summer flowers out --
they come in there ,
and , it , it had real good tips
and the people who are down there , like , they 'll assign one person in the utah area , one person in the washington area
well , you know , there 's another aspect of this , too .
and i read her stories .
uh , australian shepherd .
uh , and they stayed active was the , uh , the military there . taking supplies out to them in the desert .
and i guess she , she had her own separate room .
uh , i work in metal fab
i mean , i 've got a daughter that 's a sophomore at u t
i had a pet rat , , for a while ,
i , uh , i have enjoyed , uh , thirtysomething --
see i have , i have a tendency to , a , adopt teams when i wen , go to a tea- , uh , go to a town .
so part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff , lately .
and now i 'm down to about four
we lived in the country --
and ,
and , um , i 'm a writer by profession
and then , um , the other place is called the vienna inn which is , uh , uh ,
normally , i mean he did n't seem to have a problem with getting wet ,
that 's , that 's the key , you know ,
and , um , it 's causing quite a stir up here ,
i only get seven miles to the gallon .
i rode a ferry for the first time in my life .
oh , um , the service .
i mean , it 's like , that was just something --
that 's probably , uh , uh , something that , uh , is , is you know , is good for both of them .
-- and i am home on furlough .
but i do n't know how families afford two new car payments .
there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that was n't recyclable .
especially in large corporations . you can really , you know , wind up getting , having , you know , real problems i 've found out .
so ,
but not at , not at the human factors level .
-- at any rate we came back here with ,
but that 's all ,
and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with , uh , dried red flowers and dried white flowers and , uh , eucalyptus .
we were able to have that pretty , pretty effortlessly .
mumblex i 'm from kentucky originally ,
and , and , it 's their mission that they do it .
but one of the big no-nos is because of the fifty thousand students ,
i 've been to oklahoma ,
and the poor president has , has to , uh , either accept or reject the whole thing .
it may be .
and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i could n't recycle it anymore which is n't good for business on the other end either , i suppose .
and , uh , and so , you know , we , we do n't , there 's lots of things that we do n't get told . for good reason .
or i do n't even want to get into it in the first place .
i mean , you , you learn more about the characters and stuff ,
but , he leased , uh , to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on .
but i 'd like to go bird hunting .
men breaking in , uh , to houses and taking , or a man ,
and then they start dancing around ,
uh , and benefits , through the government are , uh , really ,
he 's got two dogs that are his constant companions ,
-- we made a higher and a lower --
i am a ,
i do n't understand , too , why we have to have democrats and republicans ,
this was a long time ago .
i 've heard of that .
the , uh , hospice program provides a hospital type bed . well , it is a hospital bed , and all the oxygen ,
i do n't know people who hunt
i , it was around ten dollars for lunch . okay ,
otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number .
they operate at , you know ,
i , uh , fear for the russians from what i read , you know ,
it 's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you .
so we , we try to , to do it as well as we can .
but it , it 's like , it 's just chicken ,
i do n't know why .
i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had to go to work after my husband 's death .
so , uh , it 's , it 's in the same old y- , you know , routine of , uh , you know , doing homework and , you know , trying to talk between all of that and , and , uh , the other activities that we all have .
we do have tax on clothes .
i plan on getting back , once i graduate next weekend .
it took forever to find somebody .
and , but it was just enter , all around entertaining .
oh , i , i 'd actually have to get a newspaper out .
and we , right now , we do n't own any property .
i recognize there 's , there 's over crowding problems
it was real pretty .
it 's horrible .
you , you do n't have to put a whole lot out ,
i , i spent three years ,
but , and , and , you know , people accuse them of controlling the news he says , you know , we do n't control the news we just report it the way we , the way it is .
i have a four year old son ,
my sons in the air force .
we went to a place called grishman 's in greenville ,
i really do n't know .
and she was very affectionate .
is it three or five ,
you just draw it
so , uh , i 'm sort of at a loss where that 's concerned .
i , i actually take both newspapers on the weekends .
you still can see well .
she , she really , uh , enjoys .
i ca n't remember the name of it
i 've got a , i 've got a , i 've got a two year old who 's now getting ,
now it 's , uh , like i say , it 's been a while for me , too .
the two little cars i 've got now ,
i play , uh , the violin --
she was a real attractive blond girl , in , in her freshman year of college --
and it was a --
you show up at parkland bleeding --
he made me laugh .
well , it 's , uh , business technology .
she , she likes , uh , action movies and , uh , and , and comedies
if , if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier .
and i started taking my things behind there .
it was like thursday of that week
in fact , that 's where i 've seen most of my movies , have been on video .
well , theirs was so bad ,
but , i hope they can do better .
i 've never been to tempe .
what the quality ,
i think five minutes is the max .
and i have seen them like go from where they 're in an apartment building ,
haywood jeffreys and drew hill --
you know , and he 's , he 's doing real well ,
because if , if they are dead for too long ,
i , i took several home because i 'm moving pretty soon
well , that 's an awfully big one , that , uh , that one that you had , that lincoln , uh ,
well , i , my experience , i baby-sat a lot also at , when i grew up
the forms are right in personnel .
you think of abraham lincoln and , you know , just the background of --
well , actually i 'm a , i 'm a dodgers fan from way back .
i mean , we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership --
and i 'm going to do the same thing .
it ends up with a barbecued taste .
oh , it was just bad .
and then like three days later this , uh , local news station was using as as their promo --
it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings .
and the technological advances kind of outdated our p c where i can get the same p c i got two years ago at the fraction of the cost .
th- , that 's what i heard , too .
i talked to my kids about it , you know --
and , and i 'll be if he did n't do it again .
that 's the one time in the day my husband and i can get away and talk --
i do n't have to worry , really worry too much about price considerations because i , you know ,
in fact , at the moment i 'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment
and i ended up ,
i 've , i 've had a hard time finding anybody i can trust .
especially when we have dwindling , uh , resources such as oil that 's burning out of control in the persian gulf , and , and so forth .
i have dolls from all over too .
and then i was in high school ,
we are west .
my main reason for taking her was , uh , just social skills --
and i mean , i did stuff
i know what you mean .
that 's , that 's why i say i feel , i feel really lucky right now , b- , because i 'm not married and because i do n't have children .
you know i 've taken time to teach them
uh , she 's , uh , however , getting a little old
and i am , i 'm glad the community is doing it .
i get lazy sometimes .
so , you know , i think , if , i can understand why the rich people do n't want to pay ,
they got to stay at home by themselves
but they do n't pick up the other items .
i 'm just getting ready to go to lunch .
it is , it 's got , uh , basically an easy , uh , rhythm and , and tone .
-- and it shows the town ,
or , or one of the lovely cafeterias .
and there 's no other real shut off valves inside the house ,
but i wanted to be sure .
and in stores and so --
in the quorum .
and then before you know it , it 's time to get up and go to work .
you , you , somebody 's life is in twelve people 's hands
i 'm going to , i 've decided i 'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters .
but then that was back when , uh , you know , the high impact and ,
i 've heard it is .
and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible , because it 's her home .
or , i , i believe they 're hitting two dollars a pack now .
and i like it the way it used to be .
they did n't have a price on it ,
um ,
and so she has a lot of insight , because she knows a lot of the history --
but , uh , and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a sheltie mix ,
but , um , these little wooden things , they seem to sell really good .
i think we know what we 're going to speak about .
um , we spend a lot of time at the playground
that 's on like route two eighty-seven or something like that .
um , i always thought that we did ,
and i was so --
that was the first time i 'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening , you know . was , was going to honeywell .
so they have their own adaptation of what italian is . i mean ,
they come in and tell us .
i really like that a lot .
sherman .
and then in fourth grade i started the clarinet ,
last time we went , we took our vacuum cleaner with us .
well , you know there are people , uh , referred to as savants also ,
and my sister and , and her husband are coming down ,
uh , i 've gotten on the bike .
-- but , uh , he likes using the little band saws and jig saws --
because i was going to say i always enjoyed that ,
we lost lives
here in maryland we have , uh , a certain portion of your , your property taxes , uh , goes to education ,
i do n't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore .
well , she 's part chow and part shepherd .
and it 's , it 's pretty maintenance free , you know ,
oh , well i 'm glad you found me .
and i found that all i talked about was my baby ,
and i do n't know what to , i do n't know what needs to be done , you know
and --
and ,
it 's kind of , it 's kind of disappointing .
i mean it was just like ,
well , i think it was because i read , um , dickens ' a tale of two cities ,
but i also found a nineteen eighty volvo , uh , station wagon --
then , i think , you know , if if it came , push came to shove , i 'd probably be drug tested --
and i 've forgotten what the political influence was
uh , right now my exercise is pretty much limited to , uh , softball league and occasional ride on the bike ,
i say wow ,
that irritated me , uh ,
i had an ,
but he 's really from france ,
-- and i saved forty-eight percent ,
i work for a public school system , district --
if you like that kind of thing .
my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between ashley and jamie 's age .
now i understand kids go out and play
and i hate that ,
i , i sure wish she would .
because at first thought , when i s- , you know , i said that not many people work , i 'm , i 'm thinking oh , well she 's going to , you know , because certainly in israel the women do work .
i mean , i just go ahead and take it to the , the regular place , where it 's , you know , they just accept it .
but i , i just thought i , it 's , it 's going to be a waste ,
it 's probably my all time ,
she 's had it for , i guess three years now .
uh , luckily , if we could be like your grandmother , i , uh you know , i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay .
but i would want a very , very , very clear majority ,
and , with just a curtain , of course , between us and , and , uh ,
too many horror stories out there that ,
real attractive young girl .
i think , uh , i find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that i should .
and sometimes those are good to , uh , do on a barbecue grill --
really not .
and everyone 's afraid , you know , of how the war was going to go and everything ,
and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars
the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers .
but i really enjoy it when i do do it , when i get the chance , you know .
you know , i see a lot of the managers
and i 've talked to several people from north carolina .
and he still works part time at other thing , you know , same job as he was doing , only he 's retired and doing it independently .
and we 've had it for a while ,
but you hear much of the same music , perhaps a new version of it ,
it 's like , in , uh , nineteen eighty-eight , nineteen eighty-nine , the local , state , and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america ,
and --
-- and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and , um , late fees and things like that .
that is really upsetting
-- and , uh , it was just exciting , you know ,
and robots probably .
and the topics are interesting , uh ,
actually the female who i would most rally behind right now , right , i do n't know much about her politics , by the way , the way she makes speeches is a local person for you , is ann richards .
-- and it 's , uh , been a very , very interesting career , believe me .
so i said okay .
it 's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace .
-- and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights , which is n't , i understand , quite exercising ,
i bought mine a year ago
but , that 's basically what i do .
you know , mumblex for what 's cut down here , you know , more will be cut down someplace else
we had a hangover and everything , you know .
and he also likes star trek .
i can even teach on saturdays and ,
and he , you were his slave .
i 'm going to have go out and , you know , in , you know , east fork someplace .
and i , uh , i 've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it .
by the end of the ten years i was really ready ,
i 'm nevin from sunnyvale , california .
-- and i just feel much better .
i will not let them watch that .
but it 's been fun ,
and i know that we ha , we have the , the can , the can , different can banks around the city --
and , i 'm really not sure how we find the individuals ,
so we , i have sort of a captive audience ,
so , i guess you need to , uh , know whether it 's a , you know , a no deposit , no return kind of thing whether ,
he ,
-- and they are so easy to do .
and i aged ten years .
and i ca n't even hit the ball .
whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller .
see i 'm what , i 'm about , uh , twenty-eight now
and then , sometimes we would go to arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group , you know .
so , in , in that , in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit .
so , i , you know , you pick up some traits from her and stuff .
you get like , uh , a bite at , at the m , most .
-- and , in fact , uh , it is actually prohibited
that surprised me because i think ,
than i was , uh , paying the , uh , property tax down there .
but we just , we do n't have the income at this time really to have any , because we have three debts that we 're trying to pay off from both of our student loans .
i did n't even know they had anything like that .
or this last month i mailed a check to them on the twenty-second
and we have a lot of trees in our yard
and they said , no ,
and plus , we like , we both like to cook ,
it 's forty a month .
we got into the fitness center at methodist
but there were people who believed he could make a difference .
i 'm not either
and then we were n't too for from the appalachian trail ,
so i guess she took off three all together
and i could n't , and i just could n't belie , you know ,
you know , if i , uh --
i think i would opt to go with a bronze .
and it really carry some weight ,
but i basically do n't do it every day ,
we spent a week with them .
but i can understand why people would object .
but other bands consider it like really hard rock .
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up
and he likes to do special music and stuff at church .
uh , for the operating staff it 's on a seniority , it 's , you know , based on how long they 've worked there .
well , um , i have a , a , a former exercise program .
but it was there before they built the dam .
actually i was up on a ladder , and , uh , fell off .
there was a woman ,
i 'm in texas too ,
y- , you know , you go even a few wi- , miles out and you got , uh , farms and everything
after the merger , uh , you see a lot of ryder pie stuff on the road .
i never really thought about that much ,
i do n't have c n n at home .
well , what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in richardson near where we live in north dallas ,
and i was n't really involved in the , the paper training ,
i 'll tell you that .
they get a penny a can they handle .
because see what happens is they have a good backup policy .
but anyway , so they could really only have four members on the team .
-- and they ski .
it will bother me .
so we have n't reached a real agreement on that yet .
but she also had made , uh , flan , which is actually spanish , i think .
like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome .
i mean , there 's just no one around .
they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood ,
uh , our , our last house was n't too bad ,
if , i like to have the t v on , because that usually keeps me , um , more occupied .
so here lately with all the middle eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch .
you know , i used to live up north .
and it 's fun .
if it ever touched my fam- ,
-- you have to be real careful all the , everything is baby proof .
although , they do the same thing .
and you know , if , if something goes on sale and i do n't have the money , i still do n't buy it .
you know , they 've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they do n't th- , th- ,
but , uh , it 's , it 's nice
and it was like paint thinner .
um , i do , um , television ratings
and i have n't really seen much .
galen just does n't go there three mornings a week .
now , i forget which way we do it .
but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or , um ,
and it was a excellent ,
well , that 's the thing that surprised me , because once i got into the plumbing --
so if , you know , if we want to drive , we pay our own insurance ,
and last semester i had stopped working out 'cause i hurt myself and started smoking a lot ,
i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it .
uh , uh , i like tchaikovsky .
i , but i do n't know that many men that have majored in engineering ,
and of course while i 'm doing it i feel pretty good ,
there 's even , there 's bad chemicals in those too .
there are some oaks , magnolias , and like plum trees , peach trees ,
and that 's about it .
i , uh , watch them on t v a lot .
and i 'm a substitute teacher
that 's why i 'm surprised i like those two shows , because usually i like , you know , stuff that just ends sort of , that you just , you do n't have to ,
and so i 'm really looking forward to that .
i mean , first of all , uh , her children were sick all the time .
and so maybe to me the key would be wh- , what is a chi- , the , the students needs ,
but .
it just takes the time to cut everything up .
and the wife said `` these are not his slacks ''
and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars
i have a couple of credit cards --
and you know , she would n't take no for an answer .
but , every year in the d c area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides ,
that reminds me of , uh ,
if , if somebody would lay it out for me , then i did n't mind cutting it out and sewing it .
i like just looking at the billboards .
that they would would be safe --
and it seems like almost a opposite ,
i mean , if that was my mother , i would really feel a lot more responsible .
uh , i 'm a research engineer ,
it is so cool , you wear a jacket , you know .
they 'd take anything i think ,
well , you know , i had a car , uh , uh , a tire come off of a car ,
and it killed those too .
and then i will purchase a good housekeeping occasionally , especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and --
i think they are , i do n't know , a classic
and then one night we were camping
and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham
azaleas grow all over ,
like in may case , i have three children --
but he has n't .
and , and like you said , the , the news shows that are , that are happening ,
and some of them are n't ,
i own a sailboat that i --
and i think they 've gotten a lot out of it .
um , i think they 're okay ,
-- and , uh , i was really disappointed in it ,
miniature golf , there 's my game . uh .
it 's like ,
tsongas is also saying , you know , capital , make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer .
and it went right up over my head
i , i guess i have similarly broad tastes .
and i guarded my children 's rights for that
we --
and we just have a ball ,
as a matter of fact , my , my , you know , the majority of the amount of camping i 've done has been really roughing it .
mumblex enthused and with it
um , now the himie , we 'll probably breed her a couple of times
so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet ,
kind of like k mart --
i mean , here 's , here 's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward , you know , getting the party nomination and , and preparing himself for the presidency
and one of the things that he said is , he went to pennsylvania this weekend
i do n't have too much of a green thumb either .
it says ever- , all sorts of factors go into health and there 's no reason to talk about one rather than another , so that they , they combined them all together .
but , uh , i have a friend who , uh , is working on this project .
mumblex i love barbecue .
we will head for , we will head for florida , maybe in somewhat of an off season , instead of summer .
but , uh , i like a little more indepth coverage
and then i mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta wi- , and some cool whip ,
and my , a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him .
fish is pretty good for you ,
and something you have to consider , too , um , because i know a- , as a , as a ,
and we bought a house .
i have heard stories , uh , from other parents that i know of , their children are in high school --
-- but he did go on college visits ,
and we 're paying basketball people , you know , millions of dollars a year for , for what , you know .
and you 're going to get a little bit more input than --
i have two sons living down there
and i said my goodness ,
and it was sort of exciting
well , the thing about them is that they hold so still you do n't notice that they 're there
but his company is , is , uh , is , uh , closing up .
so if they want to play , they have to play with mom and dad .
they do n't get to see their children ,
see , at the moment i 'm single ,
um , i , i enjoy those also , almost as , as much to a certain extent .
we 've spent the last twenty years in oklahoma .
i 'm already home for the day .
and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity , uh ,
but
well , i would , too , because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside , we 're finding out now that it 's not always on the inside --
and the other will be going in september ,
if we 're doing good , we catch a catfish or two once in a while .
so i just bought that yesterday ,
so that 's a real easy thing for me .
and so no matter what happens to me , if i get in a car accident this afternoon , i have no way of , you know , no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical costs ,
well , the french went in and tried their old style warfare , and , uh , got soundly thrashed .
uh , he , he also wrote people of the lie .
and i know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , i would feel that i had the right to , to get revenge on them
but , um , i did n't it was n't really that important to me ,
they had a dance marathon for charity or , to , to support that ,
she only taught there one year
i forget my age all the time ,
um , well , i like to cook , um --
uh , some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north .
my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that 's guaranteed . uh , james avery .
if i read three articles in , in , you know , one of the journals , i figure , you know , i did really well .
there has been a lot of speculative building .
especially since a lot of us are engineers where i work .
i like the director a lot , um , a guy named tim burton .
but then he switched jobs .
you can get an idea of what 's going on ,
and , uh , it spreads real evenly
i just went and took the , because they were offering it as an opening benefit ,
that just might not be something that everybody wants to do ,
south alabama ,
they usually have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word .
well , it was , uh , for my friend 's parents .
they go by a complete rote system ,
and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school ,
like , uh , for memorial day we had some friends over
well , i just , pretty , uh , little , you know , about everything .
of course everything has japanese parts in them anymore .
-- they left this morning for , uh , england .
so ,
and they 're supposed to modify it .
and , course , when they got bigger , uh , they were both quite into sports
well , actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have .
this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker ,
and you just feed your cans slowly into the slot ,
and we let the kids get the money for that .
i think , um , i think i was worn o- , worn out from middle east after the war .
but i 'm , uh , i 'm mostly a baseball fan .
well , there 's a lot of fat in meat .
i 'm from dallas
but , uh , when i make scrambled eggs now , talking about a recipe ,
eight to four tells me that there were eight ,
uh , i taught for richardson school district --
at least ,
that is pretty much like my husband .
and , uh ,
really did .
it 's a lot easier then .
i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs ,
well , i had the ,
i do n't know the answers to those questions .
you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere .
and then the rest will be without rain .
that 's what we did when we first moved in , too .
but ,
we 'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred .
or , uh , you know , there some people that are actually music majors .
she works the graveyard shift .
and that was a no no .
i do not , i am not sure what it is .
i have n't gotten around to doing it yet .
and , uh , i 've been divorced for , um , eighteen years .
uh , i know my , none of my grandparents were in a nursing home .
and it was , uh , it was funny , i tell you .
the equality of , uh , the roles now between the sexes , i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war , especially compared with , uh , the vietnam war
we got a sales tax .
i read , uh , a lot of steven king , dean r koontz , uh --
i do believe that 's in .
and i 've made , uh , bowls ,
one is , you often see in the headlines the big numbers .
so you make it like a pizza crust ,
that kind of gas mileage , uh , we 're , we 're kind of hoping for on our van .
they 're not , they 're not my favorite totally .
whenever they , they made that into a movie , i was thinking oh , my gosh if they show that ,
well , i guess the best i can do is , is , uh , compare apartments .
but --
one of my favorite movies , it 's not one that i have n't seen ,
well , i like , i , i just , i just bogused on all my homework
it 's kind of a , kind of a ivory color all over and --
and that got her out of the house
-- and , uh , we were , uh , unanimous is acquitting the person , even though we in our , in our , uh , gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends , because of various things ,
i 've got some onions out ,
actually they have one in richardson that i 've been to .
actually it was a private course ,
-- so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really is n't --
so i think that we did come a long way in the sense that we are allowed to vote in , you know , like you say , we 're out in the labor force , but i think we 've lost something too .
you know , now , i wonder what you think about this
i got lucky .
but , gee , this is , of all the topics i have had , i 'm doing this thing , this is kind of the strangest one .
and i do n't like that .
uh , that was a cat that hit the telephone .
uh , you do not have , uh , uh , family available or family that 's , uh ,
well they wo , they wo n't take a no for an answer here for some reason .
and so they , they , they do n't ,
i went ,
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i do n't even understand .
you 're , you 're making me hungry here .
and , then , you knock people down ,
i like sports programming quite a bit ,
well , the elasticity of your skin , the collagen or whatever they call it .
my dad works for them
and most of the seafood 's frozen .
so i 'm really into that ,
i , and most of them i have bought , um , already clothed ,
i got three .
i just went by that place .
see in a lot of the windows ?
he 's going to be ,
oh , i never , i never watched that ever in my entire life .
well it goes back to that , again ,
but , um , other than the roses i do n't have too many flowers .
i 'm not going to spend the time giving ,
we have that here in north carolina .
and he lived way out in the country
we 've heard them and , liked , liked it real well , of course .
as far as improving myself , uh , i have n't read any lately .
this guy 's place burned down ,
and that was the thing i could n't figure out
but , uh , i usually end up getting money back .
we zipped right along , you know .
one day i would like to , uh , you know , the , uh ,
i just ca n't disagree with you , with you know the basic premise .
it , it 's over by the far edge of , uh , stephen 's park golf course .
but ,
and the thing that i did n't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row , uh , time wise they happen one after another --
you know our family right now , uh , the most of it , there is only a few stragglers , uh , with any distance .
but , they like , uh , spaghetti .
but if i 'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time ,
um , i 'm not quite sure why that is
and there were cats hanging all over him . hanging on his clothes , you know ,
-- and , uh , but the schools in houston all have big , tall fences around them
i used to do a lot of swimming ,
you know , i usually do it because i want to , because i know it 's good for me , not because , i do n't feel obligated to do it .
i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house --
it 's , i 've never heard of it ,
but , uh , other than that , that 's the , that 's the way i use them .
it 's pretty high alk , w- ,
it 's the first and only time i 've done that .
i know our aunt in california ,
i feel like i have , you know , because well , we 're just a age now ,
but over here we get enough water automa- , you know , naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers ,
this is actually my third year .
and then , then that ended it .
they 're making straight a 's ,
so they --
so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too , you know .
like i said , i like it .
and so it 's a cheaper place to live , as far as the insurance company 's concerned ,
because , uh , the ones that we use , yo- , you know , are like unix base systems .
they were taken over by glass containers years ago ,
you 're , how your line goes , you know --
sometimes ,
here it 's , uh , to the point where they were letting prisoners go .
well , but , see i read an article about , in t v guide about , uh , about hunter , and about his , you know , latest , you know , his three girls , whatever you want to call them --
i thought he was kind of cocky or something .
and then i left right in the middle of it .
so --
i mean , what he does , the chief said is he just merely goes back to his , his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate
and i just lucked out and walked into this one
he gets up about five and , and --
but , um ,
i do n't put that corn meal on them .
it 's , i guess , pretty , pretty healthy ,
but , um , they have various organized ,
so basically , uh , i just keep them ,
they , they rotate those around ,
i 'm five four ,
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together , the worse it gets .
but i did n't realize that was the biggest waste of water .
and i try to ,
i 'm a trust officer --
well , i 've gone to the point where my husband , my husband travels , i get out like , you know , two or three books .
and i go , oh you did , mumblex you make very good money up here .
and i 'm the only one including my mom and dad and my brother .
i thought the book was better than the movie ,
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i do n't really think it , uh , i do n't really think it 's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else .
but it slipped my mind .
and then , so if she ever does become ill , uh , it will be like family around her .
it was a big change .
everybody i know has been ,
i know i 'm heavily involved in other things --
and we do ,
one i guess i 'd say is with my wife where we enjoy , uh --
-- but , um , i would always end up arriving at work late , because i would always end up skimming the headlines , spending too much time ,
and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to ,
i really need to go see the original one ,
as a matter of fact , there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job .
and , uh , i 'm trying , um , to , to , uh , furnish a home --
i ca n't remember what time .
and it 's not highly publicized .
and right now i 'm kind of stuck because i 'd like to have children ,
and i , i do n't even know what they 're talking about .
but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes --
and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits .
but , you know , sometime when i ask , i just feel like , boy , am i stupid or what .
and we 're , we 're thinking about buying another sedan , uh , probably next year .
well , me being from texas ,
i remember one time , uh , some cousins were in a tent
and , uh , they just published this internally , you know , getting people involved .
and i think that , dallas , it turns out , though from what i understand , has quite good ,
he is so fearless , he , it terrifies me .
and he was exonerated .
and you know it 's going it turn out good
we 've , we 've got mayb- , maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil ,
-- and i put that down ,
and it was an expensive dress .
but , uh , then i must say they all kind of like a variety of music , which is nice ,
but ,
i just pretend they 're not there ,
and i 've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise .
and , this is a rear wheel drive model .
i worked for this company before i had my first daughter ,
on the weekends i drive around , look to see , you know , who is selling what .
i notice that , um , since we moved here that we , we did get the cable t v ,
it did ,
and costner got best director .
he came from a poor immigrant family ,
i mean , and , and you know , you see a lot of these people that came east from , uh , west , from , uh , from new york with exxon or j c penney ,
i 'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs .
oh i thought you ,
and i renovated a house there
well , texas has , uh , texas has , uh , has always struck me ,
applied at all .
or he 's in the dallas area .
the , the criminal gets right back out
uh , i was n't really keeping count .
to be honest with you , i , i probably watch , uh , college a little bit more than i do pro .
one was that i take care of my mother ,
and i probably got more nasty than i should have .
well , my husband does not like to commute --
to send back to those other people .
well --
and you do n't have to miss , he 'll say , na , na , na .
it 's like sixteen hundred days or something .
but it 's my first dog i 've had
i know some people that went to b y u .
it 's like if i pay for a movie channel , then i have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them .
and texas is having a problem right now
-- uh , they do have some pine forest areas in wes- , in wes , in east texas --
so we learn different crafts like that --
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts .
but you , you have to know the right spot ,
but , uh , we just have the one check book
we 'll try to catch some crab .
it 's for , uh , the- , g- ,
and then we ended up with four grandsons .
in fact , it snowed on us in , in , gosh , when was that ?
i could just walk in the door
you go down i , uh , uh , you , uh , you go down , uh , yeah , thirty , thirty .
he was like , uh ,
ten ,
oh , well this is my first one .
well , he 's from here .
but i have seen --
that 's what drove me bananas , because , you know , i 'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and --
and she played a , uh ,
i 've never , i 've never had , uh , formal training .
but , um , it 's considered the country since it 's , uh , you know , that far out .
but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful ,
and , um , their house is going to be really big .
and , see that 's my only problem with , uh ,
and , uh , she said , hey , go for the swimming pool .
if the , if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line , they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines .
oh , they just , you know , they just thoroughly enjoy it .
and , than he thought it would be .
i 'm , i 'm very muchly for it .
it 's just we ca n't control it .
but now they 've got one in killeen ,
and , and that was their main , main money making , you know ,
and it was really , what i felt was kind of cynical
uh , and he 's from the philippines .
but that 's what , when she 's with me that 's what we do .
we usually order our tickets way in advance .
not all school districts are well paid .
i know a train went by ,
they allow it under certain circumstances .
i thought that was just great .
so , you know , now it does n't bother me at all
i never did ,
we , i think the last one we saw was , uh , teenage mutant ninja turtles part two .
and i know , like now mumblex in china he did all these terrible things ,
that snake used to watch our cat walk around .
and i needed air-conditioning
my last , uh , auto repair was my , my , uh , alternator went out .
and they , um , if they 're not going to use them they 'll give them to somebody else .
and , you know ,
which sort of gives you a different slant , than ,
so they 're pretty hip on it too , i guess .
and so , hopefully , we 'll get to travel a little bit too .
he 's the husband of ,
but you happen to look the other way during the time ,
oh , i liked that movie .
and i have been very , uh , happy about the new way of controlling the , the , uh , worm that gets in broccoli , um , by using the bacillus thuringiansis which is the , uh , little ,
what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still ,
and , and i do n't even know how to knit ,
i worked on my airline apollo focal point computer for about four years .
it 's like you 're taking our money ,
they 're supposed to ,
and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company .
i did n't enjoy her .
as far as opera goes , i 'm , i think most fond of verdi .
i was going , god , how can you be so protective ? you ,
and , uh , i like breeze ,
and we do n't have cable .
so we spend so much time with our families --
and , uh , i , i love it .
my most recent trip was last year ,
that worked out so well .
i was going to say , the weather man on , on , uh , one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather 's doing now is like tropical weather ,
in fact , there was n't an american car in there .
my father was in the c c c mumblex .
well , it 's been raining a lot here so far .
-- she had been at the beginning the , the intelligent one , the , the one who always solved the things and , and figured out and kept max from getting real messed up .
and they have little conversations and things .
we have two ,
we do n't start anything indoors
-- but i 've relaxed a lot more as i 've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself .
when ricky and carrie came over we made , um , a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit .
when the , when the anniversary came up --
so the other thing that we did was the roof of our house .
and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the reagan eight years , uh , more and more s and l simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
i will have to stop in there .
uh , we rented ,
i do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that t i has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground , you know , we 're coming up with a , uh , a new solution .
and two of them were american
and i 'll tell you how they handled this
i 've just never been called up .
and that did n't work ,
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image .
you know , when our kids were little you , you got them a pair of skates .
but howse might be a different , uh , situation ,
in fact , i had a harpsichord played at my wedding .
and , and inevitably as soon as they 're asleep , someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something .
i , i do have some spanish books ,
i 'm , i 'm a traveling person --
every time i get taken to an auto repair place , you know , every time i go , i get taken .
we have our own computer system at home --
well , there is n't , is n't too much in the way of restaurants that i do n't like .
and , uh --
and cleveland is located right on lake erie
there 's a nursery there .
and , and the painting actually takes probably , uh , a fourth of the time ,
but eventually they may try to push it through .
their rational is , is they make everyone pay for it so that it , it keeps the cost of university health services down ,
you know some people on the case were , were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges
uh , the only work i do outside the home is i am an avon representative .
like in the fall ,
there were flash floods everywhere , that kind of deal ,
and somebody said , well , you know , you could go in and , and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day
i go no ,
we h , are on pier and beam ,
i had to do , that , uh , the same , uh , for about every quarter of the year .
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery
and one of my daughters has one
she just finished up her bachelor 's degree --
um , and i do n't think i probably ever would , um , although i would like to know how to handle one ,
-- and these kids were more foulmouthed than i 've ever been .
i was just thinking
so i like a little heavier car
and it printed out like ten checks ,
it was n't , you know , blood and guts and violence and , and car chases type thing .
but ,
and there was wall paper ,
my son said that , came home
and when i say we have redone everything i mean we have done everything ,
and it 's just for elderly people , you know ,
i just do n't see the designer 's ,
and i do n't understand what their need to know is .
well , you know , i think i read about that too .
and now the young boy wants to know
and um , i made , uh , like stockings for both my children and a christmas tree shirt and that ,
it , and it goes toward different things ,
i like them .
she 's just like him .
it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage
and i guess , uh , i do n't know how old you are .
probably so .
uh , --
um , several years we did n't ,
and she paid me i think like two dollars a pair to make her some pants .
we used to play ball a lot
but i do n't , i , i 'm so , uh , timid when it comes to starting a business .
it beeps in at ten minutes .
mumblex i have n't quite figured that out .
and , uh , i 'm not i 'm not terribly in favor of them .
so it was that same car .
i thought maybe that was the trick .
and it just kept coming on up through the generations .
so i do , love to see young kids go and , and men take the pets and everything .
we do ,
i was going to ,
he was a movie director ,
and so , you know , those do n't take much time at all .
now they 've gotten larger and larger as , as they have developed the land .
have n't had any parakeets for quite a while ,
-- and , so i have a real , you know , heart for them ,
lights up the whole sky and even on a , on a ,
we have been really fortunate
and then we 'd sit down ,
i 've heard the construction is pretty good on fox and jacobs .
i do n't ,
like tornado weather and tornado warnings ,
actually , uh , that is really a sore spot with me .
so on top of the federal tax on gasoline ,
-- i will always remember ,
and that 's , those are , that 's my favorite type .
and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the , uh , various , uh , of the articles and the front section
i suspect you ,
we 've been doing a lot of remodeling .
they 've got the u t health science center out there also .
and , uh , i went , uh , for a little while , uh .
and i crocheted a blanket for my sister 's baby ,
and i will let him watch that every once in a while .
but , you know , there 's some argument that in , in , in the blue grass of kentucky that the smoky mountains that that 's the , uh , the pine trees giving off pollution
um , usually when we go , we go to colorado , to estes park area .
we did not know what to do about it .
i do n't know if it 's looking at the little th- , things every time .
and col- , uh , it just was a very mixed bag in terms of colorado .
but , uh ,
and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her , that , that she and her family just did n't have much ,
and they , they live there
i went around the trim ,
it 's walls
uh , i , i subscribe to three newspapers .
i got called
and then you come here in , in the dallas area , um ,
i worked at the , uh ,
i do find that i do n't have as much to throw away --
oh , little bit of embroidery work , once in a while .
so , i do n't know where the answer is
i had the impression ,
i 'm at home .
like the product i sell , uh , i sell mostly to older people which ca n't get it in a normal public situation .
uh , i , i would cheerfully live there .
the radio does n't really have much news sometimes .
and the side that 's on the , uh , the other side is about six feet high .
and i think the service charge is pretty low , too ,
and , uh ,
and doctors are available if they need them .
and it really did n't give a very good finish
exactly .
i 'm , i 'm five or six mumblex years before i 'm eligible to retire
well , we do n't really get together ,
jimi hendrix was the original .
i think the , the minimum age for diving is ,
that was one of the books i read this year ,
but , it turned out so much better like that .
but if i did it , it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes .
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me , hey , better wait to go to work because the roads are all , you know , snow .
now of course , there 's , you know , t i is here , oscar mayer --
uh , i was listening to something on the radio --
and while he was gone , he had looked , went looking for a job and stopped at the store ,
i mean , any other time of year , that 's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold .
so , i , i like ,
i grew up in louisville , kentucky
the first one we saw , um , they were , it , it involved a tradition of when a per- , person reaches seventy-five ,
it seems like the success ratio , the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there .
i do n't ever want to have to worry about that .
that 's one nice thing , is they 're real good about replacing it .
i 've never read anything by him .
so i really ca n't complain about this one .
but the , the prescription has run out you still had some left
and , uh , they were cooking the stuff , you know , while we were , we went on this boat ride .
i used to live in dallas . in arlington , actually .
and the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people .
and i know that companies do .
but i have never seen them ,
wow , i have n't seen those .
bad .
that 's why i brought , bought the sprayer --
the old , old stuff that came out , i think it was , was it , oh , jeez , came out with some of that , hank williams ,
but they were real good about replacing it .
and i 'm ,
i ca n't either ,
my husband 's family lives just off of academy boulevard at maize land .
i 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that .
and --
-- and then i put , uh , like , a black plastic ,
oh , there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he 's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap
and , uh , and he held on
-- and he works , and my husband works full times days
i do n't know how much clearer it can be ,
we did go see dances with wolves
you know , it would still be more convenient than what we have now .
actually , though , it was a lot rainier here in the winter , uh , we came back last august .
and they build and rebuild non jet engines .
and those guys were there doing their duty .
i had a friend who was a police officer , who was killed in the line of duty .
usually single crochet would , is , is always starts it off .
so , i 've only been in texas three years .
and , we- , everybody down here calls these flags . uh , the irises i guess , uh ,
and i 'm brian .
so , uh , it was one of those things where you go through the , the general battery of all their tests
and so she called and said things were okay , settled down and was all right .
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts --
when i had a cocker spaniel it , it was an outdoor dog
but , uh , i can definitely , uh , see on down the road , you know , where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that 's going to be a definite concern .
they had a free showing at the berkeley , um , united artist .
i still am really .
not really ,
-- and , and i agree with what you said that it 's , uh ,
but my , my wife was , uh ,
but it 's not much .
i , i , i rather enjoy the cosby show .
-- so i 'm kind of out of it .
and the prison system are just , you know ,
they can go to their regular job ,
when i was growing up my mom worked too ,
that , that really does scare me . people , you know , that have guns
um , i 've got a , uh , small distributorship , uh .
and then we come back for a year .
i 've thought about it several times
my mother did not like cats .
uh , i do enjoy , uh , sewing ,
that 's just what we called them .
he loved it .
and i 've made some of it before as well ,
but it 's , it 's quite bearable
uh , i mean , she loved the kids
i mean we 've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything
so , she 's a genuine chowperd .
there was a couple of others that are out ,
and , uh , but , uh , northern indiana , has many tornadoes come roaring across .
or it 's , it 's a good change and , a good change from cooking and eating at home
and i guess i 'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it 's like .
and it , it was just fabulous .
i 'm , i 'm glad too .
giving a soapbox to stand on .
i 'm in texas .
it 's , it 's well worth the time and effort .
they actually had to g , take a driving test on the tractor ,
they had an ag course , uh ,
uh , at that time was the same car
so , when you were giving your answer i was thinking , is this a texan i 'm talking to ? .
i think it backfired .
because of , of their , you know ,
and , uh , most french food always leaves me hungry for some reason .
that the people that i know that it did ,
and i kind of use that as an excuse .
he , he had him late in life ,
and he was going to school at five .
they kind of had that ,
it was all bloodless --
and it , it really still bothers me .
well , you know , we , my parents were divorced
i have a daughter that 's frustrated .
i hear the ,
she really was not aware of what she was doing .
he , uh --
but i , i 've got , s- , i 've put them , i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because i , there is no way that i can eat all of those
one time we tried something that really worked
alfie did .
and you were saying that you do n't appreciate education until you get out
well
and so , i had , uh , i had thought a little bit about it , um ,
and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like adolph 's meat marinate ,
i do n't use the free weights
so he had to ,
i mean they 're going through some tough times --
and , uh , that got kind of rough sometimes .
so sometimes i get bogged down in the , you know , in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking ,
but the explorer , i mean , you 're sitting up on top of everything
they are good .
very clean .
my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety , ninety-one .
we got a thing down here called a shopper .
we do n't
and now when they come together it 's , it 's generally , you know ,
we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a , just had a new baby ,
tight turns , hard acceleration .
but that 's completely up to me how i do that .
and finally they realized that they were , they were abusing them and were n't going to get out of the hole
um , i get bored very easily .
um , our last , we 've , we 've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus .
i could do it in twenty-eight minutes .
i , uh , i 've got my wife motivated about it , um --
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the , uh , the teacher 's in the middle .
a friend of mine saw it
i was from new york and so , you know , we road the bus .
but then when he 's finished he 's , he always says , well , now you owe me three hundred dollars .
well , the ,
and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home .
they , they , they 're just spoiled rotten ,
i always like ,
and this year they 're all excited .
uh , and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there .
if it 's chevrolet , i just will not touch it .
but outside of , outside of art class in , in school , i , i stopped doing most of that , unless i , i mean , like he has a computer ,
and like you i listened to radio on my job at work .
it is like an exercise in itself ,
they almost look neon .
but i ca n't ,
like we do n't really ski .
you fish upstream .
i 'm not into rock stars --
uh , i was calling from work
let , let 's take the example , the modem for , you know ,
i have no interest in that ,
but ,
-- here you break in ,
uh , so i let my son do it
we , uh , we lived out of state for a while and came back
i ca n't remember how far in advance we reserved ,
it was like last like year they had forty-nine
we 're supposed to talk about current events .
well i ,
well , i have a very comfortable car --
well i live in mine .
-- and , uh , you know , i think i really do miss the fact , you know , that it 's not a university , that there 's , there 's not , the , the , you know ,
i 'm just concerned about their safety mor- ,
it 's a --
and i know that they 're going to use , you know , the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing .
but still there are , there are other people there doing the , doing the same thing .
moved down there in eighty-seven
but i have grandchildren .
two newspapers in the morning .
but i wo n't do it with the babies .
they had personal property taxes on like cars
and , i mean , i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you 've ever seen .
and i , i , i really feel i can , i can dedicate about an hour , an hour and fifteen minutes f- , to this effort .
and they do post , uh , uh , warnings for people who have , uh , heart diseases or respiratory problems --
there 's a lot of positive things with it ,
well they 've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you 're in certain counties ,
uh , computer programmer .
i did n't think about that .
my husband likes , uh , dairy queens .
i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe , you know , like a ,
uh , we have got a book that says , uh , how do they do that ?
i just got back from dayton .
it is not a perennial ,
and they got us in trouble ,
i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic ,
ours really needs to have some work done on it
and they , they send their kids to school
i know how that goes .
so it 's not any , you know , uh , build up on the charge cards at all .
i guess it 's on late saturday nights or something ,
i suppose i should be concerned with life insurance and , uh , retirement plans
i guess it 's , i guess it 's sort of so they do n't have to move troops out so quickly or something .
because i do n't have any children .
it tasted pretty good , really .
i mean she actually asks to go out .
that 's good , good new- , good deal .
-- so that i use , because i travel some .
so everybody has a truck --
you ca n't ,
because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for , you know , birthday for somebody
um , and , uh , there 's a book called life extensions ,
uh , cause he has had him for six or seven years .
and i have n't seen him since eight o'clock this morning .
he 's with the bible church .
and this lady , you would think it was her own .
but if it 's in any level even with the potential to endangerment ,
and i have one brother and his wife --
over here , they , uh , have several private companies that you can take , uh , recycled ,
i saw this awesome house the other weekend ,
now we can put all our yard clippings out .
i stir fried some the other night though .
if they want to put a seven day waiting period , fine , again .
and it 's like , oh , i going to take this home and study it before i can help you .
and it was twenty-seven below .
and because , it threw them forward ,
huh , i just have one son and he , he lives out of the state now , rather , in the eastern corner of it ,
it 's very expensive .
well , that 's what my parents are avid cadillac freaks .
and nobody thought any different ,
but i went there recently ,
i mean we , our high school up here is like a junior college in florida --
we have two children ,
so you have to get up for that .
they just instituted it there at wal-mart --
-- and so we have quite a collection of those ,
but , it 's kind of the bible of cooking --
it 's a five speed straight stick machine .
been , especially in this country , all the , uh , the plastic and the paper and everything , we just used to throw out .
i went to college ,
before i even got married i had my cat .
but , uh , we use to have , uh ,
like , like you say , it , it , well , transmissions and things like that .
t i , of course is , is really pushing world markets in their products
i love thousand oaks .
there is a down side to all this , you know , about no good deed going unpunished ,
if you do n't , you 're kind of out of luck --
and so , i 'm , i 'm not much in favor of it ,
it , it was pretty early in the year .
and i went to take some today ,
i mean it 's pleasant , you know , music .
and , also , we have a lot of green , you know ,
texas .
uh , in fact , one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had . uh , he was struggling with senior english
but i 'm getting better .
i generally do n't get into movies that much ,
but he does n't bite anybody
but , uh , there 's been some magazines i 've looked at ,
none to cook .
my pet peeves with magazines , the woman 's magazines especially ,
i , i would like , i would encourage it .
my husband kept begging me ,
and now it has gotten , uh , that , uh , a lot of those people are d- , have , uh , have died off ,
well , when i got married , i thought it was going to be fun .
i do n't go for that at all .
that 's what we 'd rather have is just a pet , instead of --
we have a daughter who 's almost thirteen
well , i just , uh ,
we did not camp there ,
and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike
and ,
she loves it
first time she has been down there
but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such .
and so i decided well , if she 's going to do that , it would be a whole lot easier if she could type .
i mean , vietnamese restaurant we went to , you know , last week . it 's great ,
we keep our newspapers , and stuff like that and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that
i do n't really know what it is ,
i , i have ,
so i 'm pretty bad
and he did n't get him in again .
in the past we did n't have that problem
and we celebrated earth day .
so . so i have n't , uh , i have n't been in any really home repair things lately .
we have engineers who , uh , go out to the oil well , to the , to the client 's oil well , and , and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff ,
i 'm being facetious .
it 's just like , it 's , it 's just so ironic that this would happen
plus , he cleaned up my mess .
and so outside my little town ,
so they 're really looking forward to that --
and the one in mesquite is , uh , scyene exit .
and you just put them together .
she always had , uh , yeah , she always had to have a lot of clothes .
i think the pitching 's deep enough that it does n't matter .
you can go to north tyler to the schools
uh , well , from my neck of the woods , it 's hilly .
so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in , if you have a microwave book ,
and , uh , the , the people kept harassing her over , you know , over a period of months
i got out of school in may .
i usually , uh ,
-- and , uh , i , i , am close to receiving my english degree , uh , as , as , well as my , my , graduate degree ,
i 've not .
and , uh , it was a braun
i do a lot of my own patterns also .
at least with the , uh , gasoline company credit cards you have , you know , up to thirty , twenty-five , thirty days , you know , interest free for it .
well , i do not know how much different it is from dog food but , you know ,
he was in the house most the time ,
not when you figure ,
they ,
it is .
it was real aggravating ,
a girlfriend of mine found a ,
and i 've been passing them out to different wedding shops ,
we are like that
so i take it
and --
uh , i do not know why it is ,
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news .
there was a nursing home
it runs good .
there would be sort of moby fish in a tank .
they , mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings .
when i , uh , was in , uh , undergraduate school a long , long time ago , i , uh , noted that the monthly salary , starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that , you know , in my discipline , was like oh , six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that .
and it 's strange that you can do , like i did aerobics , you know , all the time
i 've been one ,
like that 's a little more a casual thing .
i , think because they were , they were scheduling a video release of it in july
he has a couple of times ,
we , we 've been married for two and a half years .
i did n't think that it heated well enough .
and what i liked about preston hollow is that the people that were there when cheryl was two , which was fifteen years ago , many of them are still there today .
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people , though i 'm in graduate school , uh ,
but i have no idea where they are .
and then you replant it in september
especially the murder rate , its just gone crazy .
i mean , the iraqis did n't have a lot of high-tech weaponry ,
i was looking through our photo album not long ago
and it was like , uh , i want to read something else for a while .
i saw that one .
and , uh , he has adjusted very well .
and i have five or six wool skirts ,
i have to dust a lot as well .
actually , uh , i 'm a pediatrician --
so that might be fun .
and it , it , everything started to click in for him
-- and date rape .
and --
but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom , that 's aids --
the gramm , the gramm rudman act .
but they are up to date , uh ,
um , i get a charge out of , uh , texas highway ,
i , i saw the previews .
i have been .
and , uh , our cats wound up getting fleas , uh , from the apartment that we were in --
i do n't know for sure what it is .
i know somebody who lives back there ,
my schedule is like from nine to five thirty ,
i finally get to the green
i sort of like that stuff ,
it was zales jewelry , in fact .
uh , i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized .
apparently a lot of people , you know , every time they change the oil ,
i 've only been ,
oh , i 've got another call .
cut us off right there the last few seconds .
but , really , that 's a previous generation .
you know , you 'd have to cli , like come over , they 'd have to come over the fence ,
and it 's in a case ,
and , and , uh , and , and , it , it , it 's ju- , just not feasible --
but in terms of the fertilizing and , uh ,
and i like a good italian restaurant --
they own the place
and over time she , uh , uh ,
and this guy was from jamaica , right .
we did have h b o ,
and , that is one of the things that they really stressed doing , you know ,
we have family that 's far away .
the different kinds --
in fact that 's what i was doing when you called .
i did not need that money .
also i like to be served .
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling , they 've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away .
and i do n't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year ,
my father would be a hundred now --
they 'll , they 'll , they 'll hit because they 're just sort of surrounded , these large schools .
-- and to know what we wan , know what he was doing --
you have to go all the way to dallas .
-- but i , uh , i do mainly graphic work on it .
i know what you mean .
me too .
you know that 's what i mean cause i am from iowa .
i got a friend who goes there , by the way .
so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood ,
we have , um , three children ,
the only thing that i do n't like also is the rooms are so small .
and some of them are there to prevent things from happening .
i know , i know that in my own , uh , area of people , whom i knew and how they were going to vote , they did n't go to vote against , uh , a politician as they did a little bit later when nixon was running .
i 'm kind of like , you know , yeah , the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles .
i 'm , i 'm with t i .
the european countries certainly , uh , none of them have capital punishment
if i did understand politics i probably would vote more ,
in a --
the judeo-christian ethic .
i do n't either .
well i 'm a ranger fan simply because i live here .
actually . i love , uh , broccoli , brussels sprouts ,
and they 're , they 're good about it .
i do n't like to watch .
island of the blue dolphins is another --
and --
we are real glad we got together because since that , that time there were only like two of the , one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left .
it pushes you because you 're pushing against the water --
my mother always said to me , `` tom , now , the best thing to do is be like you 're father .
and i do not watch a lot of television
wendy , i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if , uh , if that may be the case --
because i , d- , i have that
-- and before i got my degree , i had , uh , done paralegal work --
it 's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing ,
mumblex , i should n't say barrels , like big john doors or ,
a guy went to a d- , a landfill , dug down five feet and , and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
i ca n't figure out why they adored him .
and it 's got one of those wildlife parks .
it is , uh , probably ten years old .
even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds --
um , my favorite one is putting on the , um , tomato plant is to put , uh , mumblex dust ,
and they say you 've overextended your , your conversation .
uh , i have n't seen too much crime in my neighborhood ,
i 'm not .
mostly over christmas .
usually , or somebody that 's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership , uh --
and , um , we were n't bothered that much by mosquitoes ,
it 's out there if you want to pay the price
well , it 's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool ,
and my wife painted those , the insides of those dark blue .
and , i just , i love that ,
they have n't changed in about , uh , twenty years ,
i was looking at it ,
so we 're ,
i mean , like i , i 'd go to the , um , to the u t d , um , cafeteria for lunch sometimes --
like star trek , they thought that was much too violent for small children .
well , it just came out , i guess , yesterday .
and we try to , we used to try to get together ,
so she does n't run loose ,
but i 'd want to be with a skilled sailor .
and , uh , it has just worked out really well with this , uh , position he 's in .
-- so mine is , monetarily , i guess strongly monetarily based .
so my brother 's wife and my husband and i went .
but , i 'm not sure .
think he was in virginia ,
uh , but they are the only state that does it .
i , i 'm married .
i 've been ,
-- and then you had to , a- , go to dresses ,
and if you 're trying to hold out , you know , there 's so much pressure on you
but it 's the same stuff .
but she said , let 's go ahead and send him another day , or two days ,
you are right .
it takes that mixture of a very mature college student ,
i do n't enjoy it at all ,
like in the big soap opera shows , which i do n't enjoy because of that ,
we 're in plano .
so you have to go knowing you 're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in .
and she took it
well , i do n't know what the answer is ,
my kid is jumping on me .
and , just kind of , kind of go out and , uh , rent all the movies and , uh , uh , you know , just kind of go ,
i really enjoy that one .
uh , we have an investment plan .
it really was .
and i 'll get people --
and i could n't really ,
um , what i 'm currently doing is , uh , taking a lot of time .
it 's , i do n't know , i guess it 's just me
but it 's slow burning at , at , uh , normal pressures .
that 's how i define camping .
i lived ,
so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades ,
but i did not realize how long it took .
we debated for a long time
and i 'll end up buying , you know , candy and drinks and --
he has it really nice .
we 've got a two year old son ,
and i was picking up , uh , some background noise ,
and ,
i would like to see the results on a study done .
so , she , uh , you know , takes the motor home .
this was it , my last chance .
i , i know your son 's too young right now ,
they 're pretty old , big tall trees ,
and morton anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal .
i love those pink flowers .
she went the academic way because she 's a straight a student , which is ,
uh , we 've , we 've , uh , taken how much we have , you know , write down how much we have coming in each month
and they did .
even , i think the random drug testing , i do n't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs , because they 're still being caught --
well , now , this one that we went in ,
you know . especially if you get , forget to record those little suckers .
and then to file a , a state income tax , was also kind of tough , too .
just enough to keep them active .
and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things , and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children ,
you can see that horrible , horrible brown haze .
and so we have found that camping with the little ones is n't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves .
this is not on the topic
i was ,
i mean , i know a lot of college kids who have them , you know , who had them , but just depends .
well , i , i feel the other thing too , uh ,
and i 've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs .
i tape it .
see she 's got this little girl from israel in her classroom that she 's befriended .
and the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes , carrying a gun in her purse .
um , quantum , leap has , i mean quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way , i guess ,
but it , i think it varies , it , it just so much .
we had a great time .
and that 's where i put my samples because trunks just are n't big enough .
it was in our , in our little local paper , our little lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week , uh ,
i sometimes have a problem with some of the , especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have , you know , was , was because they were abused a , abused as children .
and we 'd usually take notes --
they were white ,
and then the judge has the final decision --
this desert storm stuff may have , uh --
so it ca n't be a fish .
and , it , it 's funny ,
you know , i do n't have much to say about drug testing .
i do have that on videotape ,
i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection .
so , i felt real good about that ,
we grow bermuda and saint augustine here .
i 'm , uh , in fact , i 'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything .
i have two girls and a son ,
went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old .
you know , i took advantage of the opportunity when , you know , he came out .
you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too .
you can drive up ,
she 's an avid gardener ,
and --
you know , we had prohibition for awhile
well , it 's real dry down there .
and that 's so , that , that 's different for me .
-- and at first we used it
owens mumblex . um ,
and i have fun .
and it helps that he has older brothers , uh ,
and the average person ca n't afford , you know , a heart or a kidney --
you know , that boggles ,
then i cut a v shape out of the back of them --
i wanted my children
i could see some having , maybe some of the tropical fish , that are really , really pretty
the other day we had talked about , uh , capital punishment .
and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age .
if you look at cert- , if you look at other cultures ,
uh , and i hate to dust .
so i wo n't be here very long ,
and then --
and , uh , she used to dress him out of neiman marcus .
and on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military , as a green beret , i definitely respect the power of weaponry .
it was very serious , very se ,
but we 've got the fans going .
that you do n't have tangible , i mean the perishable kind of things that 's gone , used and gone .
we vote on it ,
.
oh , that 's wednesday at , uh , seven thirty .
um , we have small children , two and four --
and , uh , they try to get you to go ahead and separate it ,
um , i thought the , uh , the cima- , the cinematography was excellent .
but my dollar went a lot farther .
i 'm in c , i lived in central california .
italian food .
and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and , uh , in the process of getting a router --
that works out real well .
and she 's in , uh , grade school ,
they knew the sucker when they saw one .
and he 's only four
so they 're rather have him , except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon , and , and , and have some chance of him playing , you know , earning his money .
there 's supposed to be something more healthy about it .
i wonder ,
well , i , i like biking
we eventually did ,
i got off my pace or my cordless phone ,
i was much younger at the time --
and , uh ,
but the problem is that you ca n't put the type of card that we need to put in it , in it .
but , um , i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i 'd ever ,
we , i went to a meeting ,
my brother was , uh , a guide for bear and elk hunts out in idaho for a while and , uh , really enjoyed it quite a bit ,
there must be texas people , as near as i can tell .
they 've , they 've actually taken steps to try to make it better
i 've always --
and , uh , i , i 'd like to just start doing some , uh , carpentry , uh , type work around .
when they first said the subject , my mind went kind of blank .
but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either , you know , either he or she can either go free or to jail , either one .
before he was really active
this , this friend of mine has , th- , well
and , uh , my mom wanted a vegetable garden .
uh , the stores are recycling their plastic bags now .
population of blacks among military people in vietnam was about eighty percent .
and , uh , we , we have , you know , some concerts during the year ,
somehow i just think , you know , i like the idea .
you know , i 've got some , uh , bushes around the fou- , you know , foundation planning , things like that ,
i grew up with hank snow , and lefty frizzell and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs .
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house .
they 've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here .
it 's not going to be too many more years before i , uh , uh , you know , they 'll be gone
just kind of do it .
so you 're making , uh , you know , fifteen dollars profit , easily .
and , you know , i just fell in love ,
and generally it paid everything ,
and they 're all one hundred percent cotton
and that 's , uh , course hydrogen sulfide , which is when you burn gasoline , you also produce some water vapor --
well , at least it 's maximum security , right .
one and one equals ten .
we have that addition to our paper .
and , i mean , i did not do poorly .
i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting ,
uh , my more exciting spots have been ,
he 's in computers .
-- and whether it 's alzheimer 's or what it is --
everything goes into one thing and goes out to the .
-- and there is n't really a lot of t v watching .
i 've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand --
not really ,
and , uh , now our grandchildren are participating in it
and you know they , they 've managed with those guys
but down here , in patterson , well like i say , it 's so small --
and , uh , i have , i do n't , i 've never owned a really large car ,
and , uh , looks quite good .
i hate to see a car going down the street , or even a truck or bus for that matter , that 's putting out a lot of dark --
and they do their thing .
and , uh , and then i worked in , in the child care centers
i 'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind .
but we , you know , we like the , the idea of having great extra quality , you know ,
but , you know , they 're built of that unibody steel construction
i liked that .
that what i 've been reading lately a lot of .
and it should be a grizzly bear because --
and it , it sounded very positive .
so they 're , uh , uh ,
you know , you knew you were n't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous .
and , uh , their eyesight , they ca n't see very far either .
and , uh , that particular year they had just tons of rain , you know ,
my sister does , uh , flower gardens .
i guess , i just wanted more news .
i did it last year ,
that would be my answer of an --
it always smells of cedar
i do n't either .
if i was looking at a u s map , i would say it was sort of reminds me of , of a , uh ,
and then , you know , so we got our day care free .
its reliability .
i have n't been able to figure that out .
uh , there was a company in houston that ,
i 'm in dallas , texas .
i just like , you know ,
but i 'm , i 've always been a boston celtic fan , too ,
you would n't believe it , we even raised chickens .
i have a standard .
and there they went .
and so it 's real easy because you just make one or two things
um , and it 's so dry , that it 's , it 's like going to ar- ,
and they tend to put windows in the strangest places .
uh , recently this summer we painted a , uh , out building , which is a shed that we have on the ,
i 'm not educated at all in , uh , really detecting this
i wanted to get a school that was small enough , that was personable --
i guess one thing they 're working on now is recycling plastics too .
i have .
you know , all the kids had cars ,
and , you know , you ca n't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in .
there 's a lot of unemployment right now .
i love tearjerker movies .
but i teach for dallas .
and some people do n't .
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to , if possible , teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools .
so , so , it sounds like you 've got a television going on there ,
and he bit into it ,
i taught in utah ,
it 's just awful .
because , you know , with utilities and , and homes that are , uh ,
and you have to pull out all the slicks ,
the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops
let 's see my mother 's in her early sixties ,
really was pretty nice .
i really do ,
so , it 's kind of hard to choose sometimes .
and plus , for me , it 's , uh , i mean like medical and you know , uh , benefits and dental .
but our honda just got old and just wore out .
and so i want my
and i like the nine one one ,
that would be interesting because i am , actually , um , um , i 'm , i 'm i 'm jewish
and a degree out there means a lot .
i enjoyed kauai better , too .
or is he a --
but what the , the argument is that , uh , that , uh , maybe there is n't global warming and maybe there is .
i 've got , uh , an eighty-four chevy van that 's , uh , a one ton van with a camper conversion on it .
i 'm not that up be on that sort of thing .
and i 'm , i 'm getting much better .
uh , every person has their opinions
it 's just kind of convenient
so i 'm pretty , uh , uh , i guess , decisive about that ,
i , i really thought about , uh , all the , the westerns that we have seen for years and years ,
but , it 's an interesting point , though , that , you know , everybody 's so anxious to recycle ,
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car .
well , uh , i heard on the news this morning that , um , one of our local schools , uh , lost the roof of their gymnasium .
that 's what i do .
but the aftermath is usually not there .
and my favorite team was the white sox .
and , and we enjoyed that ,
lately , i guess , um , uh , or , at least for the last twenty years or so , i 've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost , uh , defense items , at least in the last ten years , have been , uh ,
and they had never been to the united states ,
and i 'd like to tell you first of all what 's happening in our community --
you knew who was bad .
i 'm not .
the only thing i 've done to it is just add a , uh , add a mouse and a hard drive .
yesterday , i had lunch with a friend
especially if you get a , a pretty fast boat
they ca n't do anything like that
well , my husband and i have gotten into some , some problems with credit cards .
i enjoy , uh , sewing and needlework also .
he 's in kindergarten .
having both of them natural , the first one was natural and going natural the second ,
and i 've got two out of the house already
we got duke and north carolina .
it 's kind of an interesting topic
it would be a last resort .
oh , we take little nature hikes
by the time i get back from classes it 's late at night
in granada , in october , twenty-fifth , eighty-three , we invaded the place .
and they do have that at his place of employment
but i sure never wear them .
for a good three , four weeks we have over a hundred degrees .
you know , she 's got one of these huge winnebago 's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning , color t v , microwave oven --
i did n't know that .
and i would know okay , you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it .
uh , well , where i 'm from the atlantic coast conference is a very big conference
but we , they did n't run it .
and , and the people seemed very friendly and , and nice .
i did n't like her desserts very well ,
i live in garland ,
i said , otherwise i 'm going to give it to this other man .
you know . it 's all over the news ,
to , put it , we 're putting it in c d 's right now ,
we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not .
uh , i , i like all kinds .
that would be easy .
it was flat --
i 'm a real , um , scaredy when it comes to heights
and i stopped because it was so ,
like , i think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old .
and , everybody else that i 've talked to has been right around here .
and steve said we 'll i 'll buy a bigger house
and they were set up with two buffets , one for their regular sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything .
danny glover , scott glen , kevin kline , um , brian dennehy , jeff goldblum 's in .
well he just can ,
i play guitar --
and the , uh , the more upper body strength , the easier it is to play .
they 're now starting to make them , you know , the packages out of recycled paper ,
i enjoy it .
but i 'm glad i did n't .
and our daughter graduated this year
so this is the big issue with us . although i do n't recall marking it on my little things to talk about
so apparently it costs less that way .
so i was used to the heat , out here right now ,
so , there 's a whole bunch of people .
and just , he was just ahead at an early age
i think my dad put some .
and you 're thinking , oh , you would not only would you not want to be a victim
the backyard , it 's really big , too , for him to run in and stuff .
oh , so it kind of browns
i hear that 's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video .
my dad would n't know what to do .
i guess , that i have n't been able to actually participate .
i mean , it w- , it was in the , yeah , it was almost like october of eighty-five ,
and , um , up here we have , uh , we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime .
and i wondered who it was too .
i 've driven through it several times .
it , it , they , they 're trying to liken the , the father in there of the teenage son to like jackie gleason show .
it 's a , um , it 's a mexican restaurant off of central .
anyway , ended up taking it to the toyota dealer
and this lady was going to work ,
but , they say the course is very , is , is , is pretty tough , pretty challenging .
and , uh , uh , the , the waves were huge .
so , if at a particular time , you wanted to get the latest and greatest news --
uh , i also take better homes and gardens .
i agree there 's a lot of options .
they would n't accept my , uh , t i n number ,
no rain in the last month , i do n't think .
and , uh , the tax was administered by , uh , the , uh , rental company that actually was managing the apartments
but --
we have definitely put a lot of use in on ours
there 's a lot of nice barbecue places here ,
and then you just go in whenever you can .
and she , i should n't talk about this but she was , pretend she was a television show ,
well , it seems like they always --
i know i do n't .
i had n't heard that .
-- and so it 's been interesting to come to the plano area where the schools do n't have fences at all ,
i have a two year old and a three and a half year old .
it started out life as a three bedroom house , and now has no two car garage and has , uh , the two extra rooms enclosed .
oh , we 've been there .
but when i sewed it up , the face of it looked like a mouse .
but , uh , i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things .
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk .
but i really do n't know what they can do .
i like it .
and i like it just for the noise .
i have two daughters ,
and i went
if , if you ever get a chance to buy one of those , i think it was , uh , twenty dollars , for , uh , i do n't remember how many pounds it was .
i 'm going to do it right , and see if i can actually play this game or not .
and i thought , why buy this ?
i 'm just out of school
our group does a church service once a month .
but it , it 's really bad here .
they did some tracers
another thing that we saw here recently . one of , some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a , a train track ran through --
-- now , it was , it was in general , bad ,
certain medicines were , were legal now
it was n't very well advertised --
i thought , no , it 's really funny .
it was kind of ,
i 'd like to see some more teams get in .
and it was about four inches deep and then about , oh a seventy degree angle .
and i 've got some problems with , uh , two trees in my front yard ,
i , uh , i 've had no problems with my subaru ,
and everything that i have been saying ,
denver 's that , that real good e- , that real good , uh , example of sitting in a valley , kind of like mexico city does , i guess .
but , uh , we , we still , uh , oh , like to pack up , you know , just go someplace for the day --
i think i heard that was just one , was just out .
and , um , it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had
she has a private baby-sitter .
and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it ,
and i 've told them that , matter of fact i got another letter last night from the quality ford division , their still concerned about my attitude
i can have ,
and when they were trying to film that , the buffalo that they used for that scene was neil young 's buffalo .
i work part-time also ,
i 've seen that .
and we 've , we 've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it .
so my husband 's just discouraged me on those things .
and then , and , channel thirteen they 're really , um , emphasizing the problem with acid rain , you know ,
-- and it was hosted by peter jennings ,
and , uh , seems like we 're always working on it , as i 'm sure ,
that look like , it looks like a sticker
just like now , you know , there 's , there 's so much more now .
so , we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like glamour or sports illustrated .
i mean even britain has converted over
it 's this house built on , on a waterfall
i should , i know
i ca n't remember who it was ,
and , uh , on sunday , used to be on sunday nights , now i ca n't figure out where they 've moved it .
and so i really would n't know .
and , um , he seems to be very happy , you know .
but , it 's , uh , it 's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house
we , we either crock pot deer
but , even i 've said , hey look , you 're fascinated with this , you sit and listen to the cowboys .
i have the regular .
they 're , they 're women .
we did n't , we did n't even think about it , you know .
and i fluff out in it , in the backyard and stuff ,
and not many things you can play that 'll , you know , people will sit there and sing along to
and they 're very inquisitive .
some of it really --
and if , if they have jobs , you know , i hear the story that they 're taking away american jobs .
and so . but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job .
well , they are not allowed to water ,
and i have some real hang-ups .
and seven courses is n't what i usually look for .
but it 's depressing too .
and , uh , she had a seville before that that had the odd backs that was ,
and --
but it 's nothing like , i guess , san antonio summers ,
because --
i 've had several cats .
especially in those areas , it 's , um , i kn , it 's , it 's almost fifty per cent foreign , like forty-eight per cent ,
they , uh , they 've been in san diego for the last few years ,
and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility .
so i 'm actually managing to do this with zero debt .
-- and we took ,
meanwhile , i sat through the movie and said well , when are you , when are you supposed to start crying , you know .
and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled , uh , codes and , and , and stuff ,
you hear about japan .
you name it , all kinds of stuff , flower beds .
what i would like ,
we 're getting some flooding .
i d , i do , i do know a few people and have been ,
i mean the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it were n't for the fact that we ,
and so i finally got her a ken doll ,
it had gotten so big that they had it at the church .
uh , the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations and you know , in their , the society we live in .
my husband 's parents are in france .
did n't do any damage to it .
-- and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train .
i 'm with the university actually --
so , i mean amarillo .
flatliners .
and , you know , and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them . you see ,
capital punishment .
we have a dog ,
but for the most part , our mortgage and our utilities at this point , we 're in a new home , and , uh , they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to --
every once in a while we 'd go out on a saturday and just spend the day .
just the time that they were spending together ,
and i 've got a , uh , generic three eighty , or four eighty-six machine .
well , i do , uh , little aerobics , oh , three or four times a week ,
they 'll ,
ooh , i wish i could do that .
and i 'm wondering if you , if you have ever done anything like that ,
but ,
now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby ,
that 's um , i , uh , i 'm , i 'm not that great a cook
their math is just ,
i 'm not sure i like the new ones too much .
i hate to put it quite that way .
i 'm trying to learn how to cook , um , deserts without , without all of the sweets , you know , maybe use honey or something .
enough , enough to make it .
-- and if it was up to her , we would n't have one .
it only holds about ,
uh , i have a , i 'd guess you 'd call a medium quality craftsman router
well , i 've done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people .
but we do n't anymore .
well , we have saved our newspapers for years and years --
and i taught for fourteen years --
there are , uh , some groups that have their children , you know , go away for a year .
the first project i started out one was a big one ,
and now that they , the inspection systems are analyzing that , uh ,
because i was saying to him , i said , i 'm not that heavy ,
but i 've seen . a lot of things i 'm not used to yet , um ,
the oth , the two ,
they , they had a problem with they , uh , took their camaro in to get it traded and they , they had n't signed any papers
and some are in kilometers .
in some places they do n't .
we can start off there .
well , you need x number dollars for the recipients
and the parents fund them for the whole year , year and a half that they 're gone .
oh , i , i 'm very , uh , i 'm very varied as well .
oh , i did n't realize that .
you know , it drops , um ,
i mean you could n't , you really could n't use it for a room .
so , i got a good one .
i 'm not into the , the , do n't do the , the raw , raw fish like that ,
it was beautiful .
but i 'm not big on subserving as far as --
and , it 's amazing , that , uh , you know , prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks .
i read the book before
well , i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , i guess .
if you look at the region in , in , uh ,
then i , i 'd love to go somewhere in asia ,
and ,
when i was , i was pregnant through the summer this time --
because they , they like to get in and fertilize things too .
but , um , i like the choices you have now , where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some , basically have a independent life-style , but assisted care .
i would , that 's ideally the where , where i would like to be .
my wife apparently is not a ,
that 's my friends .
and the pansies looked terrible , but they came back later .
so , in a way , in a sense i 'm a pacifist ,
you , know , i do n't keep up with it ,
do you know , i saw in tom thumb yesterday , i saw the return to the , uh , the small coke bottles .
and , uh , it 's that grandmother figure , not only raising her own children , but raising , um , children from the streets , too , frequently .
and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been , uh , getting cocaine from his client and then selling it ,
they 're in missouri
let me move as far away as possible .
uh , we have enough friends here and there ,
well , i 'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go ,
and they transferred it to another one that was really far away .
they 're --
but there 's , you know , there 's a lot to see here --
as of you ca n't even ski there anymore .
so --
after --
they do .
i , i , i , i feel that way when movies are like blown up , out of proportion , you know --
oh , you get that stuff in the mail all the time .
and basically --
and , uh , i do feel like there are a lot of options .
so , uh , i am kind of interested in cakes and , uh , muffins and stuff like that ,
-- and even though the kids are basically , uh , grown , uh , they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they 're here and --
so it 's been good for our family .
but the bats eat the bad spiders
you know , uh , that 's the way my mother taught me to fry them
cause i have n't been there probably ...
but they did n't have the money to restructure ,
-- and they call you up
that 's probably what i 'll try and look for whenever i do have my children ,
and it 's really nice because that keeps them going , too , rather than just sitting around .
i , my parents wanted me to go straight to college
and i could n't imagine not having that thing on a disk --
well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also .
so i guess they 're saying , well , you know , we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways .
i 'm , i 'm not sure the catholic church is , is , is particularly political
and he was very successful .
and my kids are all sort of movie watchers .
but an aunt keeps the baby .
but the book is , the magazine is full of these mail order , computer mail-order houses
i 'm a , i 'm a doctoral student right now --
and there again , i mean , he 's gotten good service .
i wonder if we talked before .
i 'm not sure ,
bu- , buechele was back just to visit .
but i 'm , i 'm getting , not only our local area network ,
two .
but i , i do n't really have too much more to say on this topic , i guess .
it , it 's interesting that , that most people do n't realize how small the canal is .
we do n't really have any vacation or , you know , sick days or health care or anything really
-- and she , um , is a world champion twirler --
well any , you know , time magazine and even the news that ,
well , it 's probably the granddaddy of most , uh , data base management systems .
our friends live like an hour outside of england , like ash , around there .
he does n't like to be scared .
well , you know , i had n't either till last night , i was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland , ohio ,
when you , when you said it , it was kind of like a surprise .
-- so even , even into like november and december i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses ,
there 's , you know , some of the really totally country stuff , i do n't really particularly like
-- you know , i mean , it was n't even funny --
and , uh , and , and she 's just shaklee crazy , you know , because it 's her business and everything .
my dad used to work on them ,
well , i , i live right on the border of minnesota and wisconsin
and now it 's like we 're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we would n't use it .
well , i , uh , i have a long experience with cars .
i , i like the school where i went .
i bought her a set of clubs four years ago .
uh , my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago
my , my wife does .
it has n't bothered me ,
the day you sell your boat .
but if you do n't feel like putting it down , just put n a , you know .
and we also try and set aside money for savings , set aside money for the coll- , the kids ' education --
and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that
but i wish this phone would stop screeching ,
food is one of my favorite things too .
well , we used to have , uh , ralph dutchen .
and we could not get her out of the what she called the back garden .
that 's , that 's something that i would really like to , uh , to try and find the recipe for .
and everything was stolen out of it
she said it 's so awful .
and if you really pushed it , you taught until you had kids or something --
every month , my husband , uh , goes to the credit union and withdraws , you know , x amount of dollars for the month ,
i 'm about eight miles south of it .
her name 's tina .
and it 's just been tearing me up all day .
our sales tax is like eight percent ,
but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system .
but it 's beautiful ,
at , uh , indiana university .
oh , well , my husband is , is a very good golfer .
and one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children .
so .
i know california pretty well .
i 'm paying ,
i mean , i , i sometimes start little , much less , much more modest efforts ,
they wo n't make it through the summer because it gets too hot ,
but anyway , someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year ,
uh , we do use them .
and the smell ,
i guess i could convict him ,
finally , we saw a policeman .
but really we did n't have a quarterback .
but the majority of the time now i do n't get a daily newspaper where , you know , i get tons of , uh , news coming in that kind of stuff .
well , i have a friend who 's the same way ,
and it was costing too much at home , than , more at home than i was bringing in .
however the need for that --
and i wo n't know what i 'm doing ,
that was like thirty years ago
it was starting to burn some oil .
and the lo , local , local papers mumblex ask them to remove your na- , number from their list
so , i 'm home with , home with two children ,
and it was very easy to , you know , to put everything out there ,
i mean i 'm not , not saying at all that hussein was n't quite willing to ge- , enter that fight .
i mean , it 's like , it 's like the people that actually do the work there --
well , it 's an older home .
but i sometimes have problems starting the mower ,
uh , a lot of companies now are , are using , uh , drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to , to root out the , the either , uh , elementary or intermediate or advanced , uh , drug users .
and , and i just could n't believe , um , you know , that
and i says , yeah ,
i lived there for ten years .
and that 's mostly to decide whether or not the person 's actually going to stand trial .
and then that 's the way it 's kept in order .
though --
i do n't do drugs anyway .
i like , uh , i like northern exposure and , uh , home improvement .
well , um , i 'm not actually on the teaching faculty ,
about eight years ,
some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid it could become , uh , bomb quality .
and , uh , well of course , oldsmobile has got one ,
you know ,
that was a lot , that 's probably the most fun i had .
um ,
un- , except that mine are a little bit older
uh , it 's your account , period .
i know what you mean .
and i 'll take some time and do that with her .
i like , uh , the rap , the two types of rap i like , or i enjoy to listen to , and one is the , the rap that is just funny , um ,
we got this premier dining card thing ,
i , you know , i 'm a guy that plays ,
it was like a fatal attraction thing .
that 's already --
and now all my blades need sharpening .
i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor .
i had my parents buy everything ,
i did n't .
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was , you know , the need to save for our son 's education .
if he --
there 's a difference .
and i went through the t i fitness center and registered for the , uh , aerobics classes there .
uh , but i do n't know how my father did it .
and then anything extra is , you know , more or less split up between all of us .
and , um , so ,
it , it started about yesterday , i believe .
and i 'm not a certified teacher .
but you know , to me vacation is , is an issue ,
i do n't know ,
i 've seen a lot of changes , i mean , from the original earth day --
i , uh , when i first moved down here , moved into the apartment and got cable , and i guess i sort of , kind of became numb .
but , um , every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and , um , you know , would make me a nervous wreck ,
we have one of those ladders .
and that , that has cut down a lot in what we throw out .
i think , uh , i 'm young ,
i grew up in the deep south like south alabama .
i mean they really enjoyed the courses , um ,
i either like the song
and a similar hotel in paris is two hundred dollars a night now .
and i liked that .
i was driving a lincoln , a mark seven --
this is supposed to be the , the guy that 's , uh , replaces bruce lee or whatever or ,
and they work at the same place i did ,
so , uh , but , you know , i know the summers get hot
uh , i mean , it is a different feeling .
uh , i had a lot more control on it , uh ,
i almost forgot my age .
but , and they , they take care of another child
so , uh , but the others i 'm too far away to help them out at all .
you say that , because we do have , we have those architectural codes here --
and then that 's , that 's to start out with .
-- but the quality is almost laser quality .
but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and , and just going out and seeing what there was to see , uh , in the area .
and i 'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown cleveland , something like that .
that 's what they ,
we , we 've tried different times ,
and i tape because i 'm not home .
so we , we spend a lot ,
oh , it is ,
i have two of them sitting side by side --
you make your meat real , uh , thin , you know , bite-size pieces .
well , i 'm , i 'm glad i 'm not the one that 's , that 's in charge of , of making those decisions .
and you go ,
but then i would wear myself out .
and it reminded me of that .
i 've never really gotten into it ,
and he 's never had any problem with it either ,
but , uh , you know , it 's , it 's just , uh , i 'm busy .
and then i just use whatever colors i want to .
and they , they won that one seven to one ,
ha- , they do n't even , a lot of the school systems do n't even , uh , the kids nowadays do n't even know what , what the president 's fitness education program is all about ,
and i 've just been doing that for a few years now
an article .
because i 'm a teacher
and sometimes it 's , i enjoy it 's , i enjoy going out having a formal meal .
like i said , some years ago , i think i would have said there 's no place for capital punishment in the ,
and it 's got a lumbar support in the seats .
and then , uh , i like watching a lot of like college basketball and ,
so he 's going to be
i 've never heard anything about it either .
so i 'll probably go back and buy one ,
have n't been there ,
-- and that 's nice and everything ,
but it 's been so much fun too , uh , talk .
uh , the road less travelled was probably one of my favorites .
it 's the only , uh , minivan they make that 's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it does n't ,
and i , i knew he needed an alarm clock .
so , she works with in , in , in sales .
i used to smoke , you know --
we 're neighbors .
we , uh , saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws ' place last year .
we , we do n't want to do too much more .
and , uh , he was just skin and bones , you know ,
it , it , it 's just an exercise mat that rolls up
and also like my mom , my mom thinks ,
well , we took one load over there ,
the older kids had wanted one , though ,
we 're looking at that now ,
and so , every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that 's how often they change the ,
or they , i agree with the freedom of the press , you know , and all the amendments ,
because i lived in indiana all my life
this was around the turn of the century .
i do n't really switch around to new things very often .
but she goes in the senior citizen center .
and , uh , each one of the , everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for , for like soft drinks
it 's gone up , you now , maybe like five percent --
and , uh , it 's real reliable ,
and --
i , well , i 've also found , too , i , i try to work out regularly
you pick them up , you know ,
that is out for me .
he would , you know , laugh with the kids and play with the kids
and , uh , the cost of living here in california is , uh , i would say rather pathological .
-- i will have finished , be finished --
i mean i like to fish for trout
so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over .
but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was .
we lived in chattanooga , tennessee for two years .
and , and my wife recently , uh , decided she had to go to brazil and was going to take off
and the lady said she could n't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery
but being from dallas , um , i think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every we- , month
and , you know , i do n't , i do n't like , i do n't g , ever get anything over the phone because i do n't want to give my social security number out .
i do .
the three , the three baltic , uh , republics got out as quickly as they could .
-- i really do .
or we 'll , uh , you know , put it out on the grill so that , uh --
university of texas , dallas .
so i went out a lot with her .
and i can , uh , relate to that , uh ,
i forget which one it was .
we live right by the airport .
actually it had been , uh , it would have been , it had been a repaint job .
i do miss that .
it 's very interesting .
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere , any time .
i said , whoa .
hope , hope the stud will find her attractive .
most of that 's done with rifles and such . uh , though there 's , you know , probably i 'm sure some sector that does it with handguns .
and then i went to school in utah ,
i know ,
it was ,
and then we usually stick by it .
i , at first i thought of food , you know , because that 's what , mainly what i buy ,
well , i , i was in physical education then
i mean they came in and up and out
but , um , i think they took the dental away now .
well , i see that we both share the same belief here that --
and they bred it for companionship and , uh , uh , disposition and , and ability to hunt .
we have , we have federal income tax .
so i 'm not going to , no goi , i 'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there .
i , uh , i , i guess i 've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues ,
so we do that with , because we have milk cartons , you know , constantly ,
and , um , he 's blind
-- and now we go , our children go ,
these people are middle class people , just like us .
i was just thinking ,
and , you know , just in one lump ,
so , when i bake it 's usually to take out for something .
and i catered to their diet is the only thing , though ,
they 'll call me up , you know ,
it 's been cold in the building .
same sort of problem that happens --
but you know , i ca n't even remember how i did it now .
you know , sunday brunch , all , all you can eat brunches .
but it turned out it had to have been my husband 's office phone number .
-- my mom saw that
and now he bites her .
it , it ,
they were on
and when i was just married with no kids ,
tuesday they went to that .
um , the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see ,
that 's the first time i 've ever done that .
and we just absolutely ,
-- and kind of a couple of people , they just took it from me without me knowing really --
and twenty years ago i was , uh , in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter .
i only know of one woman who 's decided to go that quote , unquote , traditional route .
and , uh , i- , i was really impressed by the , uh , the , uh , factory , uh , tours and --
uh , one of the things i did not like was the weapons , the weapons , i ca n't even say it , the weaponry th- , systems that they used .
that 's it ,
i ca n't even remember what the recipe 's name is anymore ,
uh --
i , it , uh , the , the , that , that 's a , a negative about , uh , where , where i am in that , uh , well , i came out of , uh , i worked five years civil service
and --
i --
uh , and it 's supposed to rain tomorrow
one , uh , big thing that , the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their , let their child experience college in a kind of general sense .
as a matter of fact we 're the ones that i have been to houston to , to , you know , to visit the , uh , space center out there ,
and people buy jeans in town ,
and in the , in the morning i try to sleep because it 's , it 's dark thirty .
it was buddy ryan , the one that i ca n't , uh , uh , stand too much .
that 's ninety , that 's eighty-six through ninety-one .
i was reading
my daughter 's five ,
it 's , it 's been done for quite some time .
and yet he , he did wind up having to make a choice .
anyway --
and i do n't have children around
well , according to what they do at t i , if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name .
i 've always read the new york times when i was younger ,
and , uh , then after that i , i went to work .
say if i have four eggs , not , not for me ,
and all they did was just , uh , make a beep noise
dallas is south .
and , uh , this one guy decided to play , uh , lonesome cowboy or something .
but leasing would n't ,
i think so .
i did n't give away the whole thing ,
and they have ,
it was .
it flies through the air .
i have n't had a big problem with that though .
i will admit i work with , uh , someone who 's iranian ,
and i 've thought about it myself
well , off and on ,
so for about twenty min- , twenty , thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in .
but when i find ,
well i bet you there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year .
-- and actually the recycler , there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler , uh , with the handicapped group will also accept those .
and it is hysterical , i mean
and we went to the marble quarries up there , and , uh ,
i have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand .
and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to
even if they play every day , that 's over five months worth .
they have got the quarterback there in randal cunningham , who 's just , you know , phenomenal ,
and i did n't know that there was even a cut off or anything .
i usually try to catch whoever 's in town though , i do n't specifically ,
in , in at least in criminal law some of the , some of the ,
so , i guess we 're supposed to talk about foods today .
she was like the glue ,
when that first came out , i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that .
it 's , you know , it 's a nice home ,
but --
and we 're not going to just kill ourselves
i ca n't hear you at all for all this static .
i have , uh , a , a chowperd myself .
i do n't think that many by the builder that built this house .
but , um , they have about four or five different prices now ,
he 's gone three weeks right now
and ,
but they like to , uh , spend time with me .
but , uh , back to the issue , is , uh ,
pittsburgh , pennsylvania .
and i said , well you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise .
and she 's , she 's grown up with them and loves them to death
i , i like hot stuff ,
but , it is comforting to me to see , uh , more concern about some of these things that , that cost us money .
and i thought everybody was gardening ,
our house is kind of on a little hill ,
it , it 's just like being outside .
i do n't know if it 's any different than other companies ,
well i saw half of it ,
it puts mumblex a whole in your money bag ,
see i tape murder she wrote .
dallas i know of ,
my dad has been a , a , uh , lincoln man for a lot of years ,
actually , i did n't hear it .
i have xanadu and precious , and rascal .
i 'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area .
because i mean when you rent a video ,
and then , and then like about , later i , i tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter .
and it was a dog that we gotten
but usually if i 'm , if i 'm , if i take a day off or on the weekend especially , i try to cook ,
-- so i imagine we will be , uh , shifting over to that service --
but , uh , i , i , uh , did have a group come over from one of the banks , over the children 's hospital where i was volunteering
but i was wondering like , you know
and that does look very odd in the water .
but they , that 's the way it is ,
they 're even dark ,
and , uh , we had a review today
and i could n't get over ,
we could n't think of a better time to buy than now .
me too .
because our house payment is once a month ,
but that 's the , the biggest one i can think of is just , just all the solicitors calling .
and , um , you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
i , i could have used that recipe ,
i know that in raising my children , uh , i was fortunate ,
it 's one of our favorite movies .
but --
oh ,
oh , it 's mine too .
and , they just ,
uh , my next car to buy probably would be a cadillac .
and i think that t i is latched themselves up with an established group .
they all go out there to play with the barbies --
well , see when , um , i first got my mai- , my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange .
um , i mean that 's like your mother ,
we have , uh , a six year old .
i have kids
up until , like , eighty-five or something was the ,
so the only basketball team , pro anyway , in that part of the country is chicago .
i 'm , i 'm usually in the eighties or nineties
my brother lives where i work ,
i 've done that once or twice .
uh , i work at t i
and by the time we had kids i could n't quit .
-- but people that i have known that have done that , like from other countries , especially ,
he is , he is getting to where he likes them .
something happening to me at christmas time that , that verified to me that i will al- ,
and she 's going to get her car ,
i have two girls ,
hondas have great resale value .
then there 's the , uh , dolly parton , uh , hollywood sound .
and one of them broadcast every twins game live , you know ,
uh , well , i like to be entertained once in a while
but , uh , uh , anyway , it 's , it 's , it 's fun .
um , basically , they just stay with each other , brothers or sisters .
my job at texas instruments , i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls , so , that , i do n't get any exercise doing that --
um , this lady saw us at church
well , that 's , uh , one of the things th , that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant .
oh , i did n't see that .
um , we 're discussing the capital punishment , i believe .
i mean , the , the best i 've been up here so far , you know , up , in up state new york --
and , i just , i 'm just totally aghast at a what 's going on .
but i , i felt strongly then that even if they did n't feel like they could kill someone , or go into a military situation , that they could help the country in other ways . be it cleaning out , uh , lots , in , in their neighborhood or ,
so i 'm like , well , that 's the last major purchase for this thing .
and then you take and make a , a dressing out of , uh , russian dressing , one bottle of that --
that 's what my wife does too , um ,
and then cutting the trees , you know , that bothers me .
and i 'm willing to sacrifice , i guess .
i want to , i want to know if the doctor 's doing the right thing to make me --
i used to be in ohio ,
uh , i would probably go with ,
i go on ,
i mean , little by little , i , i started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things .
and i thought , well i 'm going to t- , going to carefully take those hoses off .
in my , my , uh , father 's family , we get together every year at a different location , either dallas or oklahoma city .
uh , this is a , a question that hit pretty close to home .
eventually things just went too far --
we would go down --
so , i 'll probably have to sell the prize i get .
it 's frustrating when i do n't know what 's going on .
so , uh , i do n't have firsthand experience right now ,
and it 's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing ,
and , uh , more than once we 'd get out there on a really stormy day
if we get a place where we can have both , it 'll be great ,
and she said oh , i found the most wonderful place that i 've been taking my daughter
and you have a , have a little taken out of your check each , each payday to --
so next time we 'll do that different .
-- but , it is , uh , when the strawberries are nice , and big and fresh and yummy .
i just have , i do n't know , i just have never seen any interest in him ,
he is an english author who writes some mystery .
uh , when i was home those few days around thanksgiving and the , uh , the truck came by , well , we all ran out to watch it because , you know , we 'd never really seen it --
and i , i did , used to be all in favor of it ,
because , uh , if you go to the bank and try to get a loan , they want to charge twelve , thirteen percent , you know ,
or he , i guess it was a male , he ran off twice ,
i just have can cat food .
and therefore i enjoyed following those particular players .
it 's very , very generic .
and they 're , they 're pretty fun to drive ,
but , but , even , even in that circumstan- , in that , uh , uh , situation he would b- , he would hope that there would be people around him who would , uh , keep him from doing the , doing the things .
you learn the , you know , the hard way , you hate paying all that interest
i have a dog named grisly , who 's a ten year old , uh , mixed breed between golden retriever , afghan hound and chow .
it is .
and , uh , someone said that was a lot of fun to go do .
the guy , the guy that played in it , he was not the star , but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in , uh , oh , the one about the old people .
and she said that was an excellent movie .
but i do n't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
i listen to a little of that
but the major cause here , and we always seem to , and it seems to be validated by the press , is the car pollution .
and we usually , you know , we just dump it in the middle of the garden , you know , after your garden 's basically done --
i 'm glad to hear that .
and they 're always watching them ,
-- texas
and the carpet was new
i thought i 'd better see that one before i go and see six .
i like to listen to some of that .
at new years ,
i 've only seen snow once this year .
but i got talked into the bike instead .
but see , the sports brings in the money .
he had a blue , blue bowl a few weeks ago that he , he fixed that way .
and it 's called a user boards
and felt that , that mumblex ,
i have a cat and a dog named joey .
i , i do watch that one .
oh , i 'm all in favor of it ,
i mean , that , that , i think , tends to keep ,
and , uh , as a say , i , i tend to be around , uh , civil cases because i 've been an expert witness some ,
i 'm , i 've never played an instrument in my life ,
so .
actually i have n't .
i do n't take much more in myself .
i had to explain that to my ,
i do n't go to east texas .
and you do it again .
and i 'm , i 'm down in the , the central ,
well , see , i do n't really care for cinderella .
cars ,
but , uh you do n't eat it at all , you know .
they count , yeah , as a principle ,
and i just --
i have a kind of a big family
-- and i have a idea it 's going to be a , a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than --
look how young she is ,
i mean i 've been married now for about nine months
but ,
-- and i assumed i , you know , it was from the switchboard .
but , uh , it sounds like a very impressive piece of , piece of work .
but , uh , if it , uh , gets down between two , then i 'll , i 'll vote for the party --
you 've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing .
i mean it was so ,
i grow a few things in pots ,
and , but i fed him
and --
and , uh , i just wo n't do it .
they do n't have kitchens or anything --
but , uh , you know , they were filthy when i 'd get home .
but if it 's got soda in it , it does .
i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian ,
and she said , i do n't think he 's sick , i think she 's pregnant , .
because she , you know ,
because , um , he really wants me to concentrate on my studies .
you know it always kills me cause i do n't like the , the decorations so much
and i 've been raised around prison --
i do n't know about the vikings .
and , uh , i did n't really start getting into music until i went to college because , uh , my parents did n't really have music in the house .
and there 's just sort of th- , this stuff you see , you know , it 's sort of like glorified sugar .
um , huh . well , i do n't like it when , uh , people listen to my phone conversations , like if they 're outside my door while i 'm talking in my room ,
we do n't honor god with this mumblex portion
i 'm more interested in trying to understand what 's going on in the world --
he works up in plano .
do n't do any , uh ,
i 'm sitting out here right now .
and he had skipped bail
when i like something , i usually try to figure out how to make money off of it .
well , i had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be , you know , could not take care of herself anymore , was confined to a nursing home for a while
i , i have seen that
and we came up here ,
and i get paid monthly ,
uh , i know one , uh , gal
and i saw all those trees ,
and , of course , they do n't have that here in texas
in fact , i mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around , from city to city --
i like being able to go back into the mountains ,
just in case .
i do n't know how you feel about that
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that .
they told facilities they could not work .
oh , that 's where i live , too .
but then i thought about it
i absolutely loved it .
one of my favorites were
actually i just went to see the greatful dead about , i guess about a week ago .
you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i do n't ,
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us .
well , i think it has the best flavor .
and the public schools here are ,
and that was , um ,
but , uh , we had , uh , you know , all these , we have all these , uh ,
i always try to read the sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the , the week 's hot events .
well , we 've been here since sixty-six .
i did , i had a friend that said , you know , before we always said we do n't want children because we ca n't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other
i 'm a computer scientist .
i ca n't , you know , name the names of them off hand --
it 's been i bet it 's been thirty years since i played tennis .
at b y u .
well , i , i do n't really have anything against rap music .
and ,
and , uh , so he served out his , his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system .
we came from nine years in a condo , uh ,
and there we had , uh , i do n't know some ,
espec- , this particular one , i think , was in maine and new hampshire , where out in the , just kind of out in these little towns they 'd be in ,
in arizona .
so . but they 're really reasonably priced ,
and then i wall papered a couple of walls ,
and he was on trial for it ,
i certainly have n't done that in sixteen years or whatever .
that experience was awful .
well , i 'm impressed .
but the f m signal does n't reach this far .
i have n't ,
they , they think that 's a lot of fun .
and , um , seems like a people just do n't , or also do n't have any family around .
i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad ,
uh , oh , dean , uh , kratz , or kranz
but ,
and we never know where it 's going to flood .
and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive
and he makes calls to people who have problems , you know , credit problems ,
and the moody blues ,
like the liquid is like ,
-- but , uh , they was getting a program set up , that for all new hires they was going drug , uh , give them drug tests .
i did .
i mean he does that .
well , uh , i bought a motor home here f- , four years ago --
so you , relatively clear air .
we were joking around about , uh , winning a sweepstakes ,
i have , uh , i have one favorite soap opera .
and , so , some were vacant for quite a while before they , you know , they finally sold them because there were so many .
i mean , we did n't have to worry about that before .
um , actually i , i 'm pretty untalented .
we 're paying double rent , double utilities ,
you know , interesting enough , uh , the food part was kind of , uh , important thing in our camping .
but , uh , and it 's , you know , it 's very comfortable on the highway .
it 's just that my kids are gone now ,
and , uh , she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary .
i like just about anything .
and i said , that 's great .
i like those movies that you watch time and time again .
it was amazing
and it felt good ,
and so that 's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved .
so we 're riding bicycles
i guess that 's about all .
but he ca n't say anything .
but maybe juries could be less than twelve people
i , i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally do .
it was fun ,
and , uh , so , uh , to drive back and forth to work is all i 'll need a car for pretty much .
i had a rock to weight it down ,
i was looking for a four door car having driven the r x seven so long ,
like i think a t and t has one that 's free if you make two purchases a year .
-- but , i 'm not , i 'm not naive ,
i love danielle steele
-- and we 'll see how the generations go .
it 's , um , it 's an odd film
they have a death penalty .
well , i 've been lucky .
this is for our friends that came over and helped .
to just go buy a pair of jeans , we 'd drive an hour .
but the- , the- , they took that check and scurried it to the bank
and i , i remember that it was on into may before it really started warming up ,
last year or the year before , i ca n't remember ,
sit-ups , of course .
isabelle chang .
we found one restaurant we were in and got seated ,
and i , i guess the next one is , is door-to-door --
uh , purdue .
i know who you 're talking about .
and she 's , uh , sedentary all day long --
now , see that 's recycling , you know ,
and i 've kind of always ,
not because there 's much else .
it 's less expensive .
they 're fun ,
gosh .
i 'm not that hard-core .
but on a highly populated area , like some of the soviet cities would be , with the weaponry that 's attached on those things , there is no place to hide .
but like the friends , other friends of mine have cats ,
i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then ,
but ,
but when i do i just , just love it .
they have a really nice championship style course that --
they do n't ,
i did n't have time to do that stuff either .
we had , the kids had rabbits for pets ,
and , and nothing happened ,
ours is one level only .
you know , i mean , i , i , i 've never liked credit cards --
i 've seen it .
everyone on the boat was catching snapper , snappers except guess who .
like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever
but i , i still have a pretty good feel for it ,
but they --
but i , my grandparents were looking into it before
they had several futuristic cars .
it really does .
and one foot did not come out of the sand ,
not yet .
uh , we usually wait
and i feel , i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for , particularly airline pilots and the such .
and when i go to visit her , i love to get out on that bike trail , and either ride the bike , oh ,
that is right ,
and , um , uh , he has a dog and everything ,
it really did .
you know , it 's funny
it 's , it 's really ,
i like those ,
not , not with what i did . uh ,
because that 's that 's all that we had --
we 're only just a few , not a few minutes , we 're , you know , forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland --
it 's just an individually owned seafood restaurant .
-- he crashed and killed some people because he was , uh , smoking some marijuana
but it is a home . um ,
but , i mean , a lot of people are flat not educated
oh , the mud dog .
and everybody else brings something .
oh , that 's why i asked you .
i was ready to go back and see it again , you know
-- but he was found guilty of anoth- ,
my , uh , my kids are , they 're starting to grow up , you know .
but --
i used to watch it , was in high school and college --
and a lot of them they put out on parole
and i 've seen cros- , cosby show probably ten times .
everybody , people who do n't even like cats , like him .
mumblex they have three dogs .
actually , i 'm excited , tomorrow i have a , uh , luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do ,
course we live in a , a rural sort of setting --
now it costs me money to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country ,
you know , it had that , that after taste that , very , it was a very indian flavor .
i did n't really have one in south dakota .
but we 're getting a new stadium next year
but , they 're , they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern .
ours has too .
i mean , you know , we had never driven outside of , you know ,
i ca n't remember what company it was ,
and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the honda
i do n't , i do n't feel for the most part that i 've been discriminated against .
i , i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six .
i mean they cover , cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper .
so it gets tough ,
and i go , um .
uh , well we did , you know ,
ca n't do , oh , really --
the three oh five was that , that ,
well , um , i , we just recently graduated from rice university ,
-- but most of them are going and seeing grandma and grandpa .
uh , and the ones that sometimes will hook me , to put down my book , will be the one , there was one , uh , recently about the gettysburg address .
the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they 'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open .
they just really do not want other animals on their property .
but i just , i just sometimes feel like i 'm being used .
in fact , uh , just a little over , just a little less than a year ago , uh , my mother went to be with the lord ,
so , i then read , was it battle cry of freedom ,
-- and i 'm thirty years old ,
and now it 's down to like , fourteen million .
in our case , it 's like , when you hire on , they 'll test you ,
uh , she goes to a home .
and , there
and i just , it , i like to move a little faster and cover more ground .
that 's what i 'm saying , you know ,
uh , pay them , uh , based on the percentage of business they bring , instead of based on their salary .
and i did n't realize , when i moved here , that it was a separate town from dallas .
but , uh , we 'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little , uh , escapade for the day and , uh , kind of , uh , do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to .
and , uh , but , the other little creatures would take care of what was left .
well , um , i have an interest in art ,
got three bedrooms , one bath and that just makes me scream .
and i felt ,
and then you sa- , you make the bread
it 's , it 's funny , uh ,
our next vacation will , will be scuba diving ,
-- there is snow on the ground .
i got a sister over in , in , uh , washington state .
i 'm an end user .
i said i 'm losing you ,
but , it was , it was a different type of show .
and it has been a few years ago ,
each one of those sectors has got a soviet general over the troops that are there .
that 's kind of , um , the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies .
i , i make so much money here at t i that , that we just spend it .
anyway , did n't , he did n't have the personality ,
you know , because , boy , they seem like they really get out of shape ,
one time i remember , this was back when , even , uh ,
again the only reason i took the time is because i was personally acquainted --
i 've got some that i , you know , i have n't even used at all , uh , past few years
i mean , that is , you know , just a , a rate that you have to pay
i had never heard that before .
she 's a nurse , you know
like , um , in the warm weather it 's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that
i particularly like dick francis books , and just some of the , the authors that are , uh , for mysteries , just , you know , just , uh , purely for entertainment ,
that 's what i 'm hoping .
monday night i 'm just worn out .
well , we have got two boys and a girl also .
uh , but that was interesting .
they stop their o b at least .
i mean , i , i have a friend who , if she likes something , is n't sure what size somebody might need , will buy it in every color and size and , you know , take everything back again .
and it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago .
this is the very first one i 've , i 've talked to .
she 's only been around one and , and sometimes two people at the most
and i could n't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was , was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were .
they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked .
but , uh , i am hoping that most of them were just kind of ,
but this weekend i cleaned out some closets
my masters , anyway .
i , i mostly jump rope more .
well , parents were getting really angry about this , because they said , why is my child being put in this closet .
they 're always saying that somebody 's going to ,
and he just turned three months .
but i just do n't find the time that i can use it .
-- and we have a three bedroom house .
but i only had her going two days
uh , i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off ,
however , my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home .
all the money is turned over to me .
computer engineering .
and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time .
but i 've got pre- , two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard . uh , you know one on either side of the yard .
at first they told me .
i put , uh , my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of --
and he only has certain office hours ,
that was a , a great one .
and i always thought we 'd get outvoted five to two --
so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy 's first offense ,
pr- , pretty sure it was original , original book binders
and it 's been a real good car --
she 's , she 's the oldest one and , but , uh , very possessive .
i know my son has had to do it for both sam 's and wal-mart --
and so , i do n't , i 'm real glad that we did n't go see those funny ones when i was , when i 'm still sort of on the sore side .
i 've never visited baltimore .
you know , it 's , it 's hard to , i guess , for me to justify what so- , seems like , you know , basically a breach of the first amen- , you know , freedom from , uh , search and seizure , you know , uh , on something that may or may not stand as a law , you know , fifty years from now or even twenty or ten ,
we have two p c -s at home ,
but it 's part of the inspection sticker , you know ,
you know , lots of local fans , you know , small stadium , you know , um ,
in m- , in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old ,
i mean , it grows like a weed .
well , i have a daughter that 's in the , in ,
it all depends on what i 'm fishing for , and the time of day .
. i bought some at christmas time for friends of mine that have c d players .
he was n't in the book ,
i found that ,
i did n't tell you what our weather is like .
and we had a n- , different boat every day .
and of course , it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity .
-- and then other ones , uh , are the older children .
when you look at the , uh , you know , route seventy-five , coming down there . i mean , it 's actually a bridge ,
and we really had a good time .
i was summonsed down to the courthouse last week .
but he pops up on the dallas scene quite often .
but spraying does put on a nicer finish .
i mean if i miss something big deal .
he 's just , he 's just kind of there , real friendly and docile .
and so i called the credit card company and said , well , we have n't really taken possession because it 's not useful for us .
highland park 's thinking about going that route .
they play two or three times a week . like , you know ,
and then they 'll ship the parents back
at least at honeywell it is .
and that night he came out , and the trap was gone .
i just read about that the other day ,
and i said , you know , i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the united states , to
i had to register us in there .
but you known , ronnie , in austin , went to a program and went to a social worker --
they had bottles
she had a son that was epileptic from birth ,
oh , i , oh , i , jeez , i think over , um , three hundred --
and he befriends this old man ,
but they ,
but as , as far as , uh , regular t v shows , i mean , i 've got some , some shows that , that , that i would be afraid to admit to you that i 've actually sat down and watched .
and that 's why i checked that i wanted to do that , because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime .
and i also find that , that you can send a kid to school ,
so it , it 's basically a bunch of small towns anyway .
but i 've , i 've got some opinions on it .
and , uh , i 'm building a , a log house at a farm that i have in east texas , which is --
the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child 's education ,
but , um , so i tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when i was paying attention .
and , um , they have a calligraphy show ,
and for the longer term i , i read , uh , like scientific american and , and , uh , readers ' digest and some of those other types of magazines that come out which , they ,
we 've , we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough .
and the cambodians were n't even supposed to be involved .
i can not really say that it 's a formal budget ,
oh , i 'm at ,
it is .
the seville is totally different ,
oh , i used to do that .
uh , it 's , it 's a mini van ,
they came in
and that way you can watch it at your leisure .
now , i have , know exactly what i 'm spending
so i was n't sure when to start her .
well , i guess that 's all .
i grew up near houston --
they have to be home by such and such a time ,
the guy that 's doing most of my , my car now , uh , goes to my church
but the topic was boring i thought .
well , um , i did a lot of baby-sitting when i was younger .
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards ,
and that 's just where my heart is
it 's just i 'm not economical
i 've never had any luck with their 's .
i 'm , i 'm in texas .
guess it did n't last too long at the box office ,
i 'm , um , i work in a high school .
we 're supposed to be discussing the subject .
and so it does n't bother me at all that we 're , we 're , uh , kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this , uh , throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies .
well , one of these days , i 'm hoping they 'll have some kind of medicine ,
they 're perforated ,
what they use to do is , they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off --
and they always died --
i do have friends that watch programs
and it tastes really good because it 's cool in the summertime .
i think some of the folks that are n't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that .
we lived there for five years ,
we do n't really have a problem with that , um , in these areas , um ,
i , um , i wish , i , i mean i 'd seen it when , when , you know , it was originally in the theaters
but , uh , what i have learned in the , uh , ten months we 've lived here , is it that when i entertain , i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the , everything through , ready --
and that 's , i think ,
we had ,
and , uh , you know , they take payment any way they can get it .
and then we saw ,
and they came out four thousand dollars better a year , by taking welfare .
we 've been wanting to start camping again this year too .
ours is changing .
but it , it makes a great ,
that 's why i have so many different levels of p c -s around at the moment .
i 've only seen him in funny stuff
not really .
and we 're waiting on my sister .
i know , uh , i 've always thought more about the disease rather than the der- , research ,
and we camped in the snow , and in , uh , snow caves ,
she just has been ,
uh , i 'm not sure what the future holds for that
-- and he 's going through a stage right now where he 's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can --
i was curious .
and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more .
i like just about any kind except country and western .
and so , i had to go back the next week , as well as a bunch of other people from the university ,
and i had gotten home shortly before that , uh , the rain started .
and i mean i , i wanted every one of them .
i understood that .
-- and we have ice storms every year .
well , when i bought my car , it was right out of college
i 've lived in texas most of my life .
not all states have them
and , and it was at least two months after i got up here .
i stay home most of the time
and then he 's playing with robbie shoncar ,
uh , that 's about it .
oh , that 's what i 'm majoring in .
usually there 's a , uh , a double seat behind the , uh , front buckets .
at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas .
so then i went to crocheting ,
i think that 's one of the reasons our ,
but , uh , we , we , we t- , we , you know , we 're , we 're big movie people
but , um , she 's been a good dog to have ,
and it , it 's bad .
but outside of those kind of things , you know , the other thing that i 've really gotten into reading ,
then you can go right through .
they repealed it --
well , i know like when i was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom , you know --
and , uh , my folks have always had .
-- but that 's which came first .
and that 's the only thing we ever ,
fuel is , is one of their biggest costs .
i teach at a public school , actually ,
so in terms of when you were in school , i am sure that it was , you know , the majority of your high school and junior high years .
but in the summer , i try to read a lot .
the last two years , i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home .
and what i was surprised at is that on my little nissan i bought the truck with about sixty thousand , i have almost one hundred and ten ,
oh , it was just unbelievably hot .
he likes it .
well .
and where they had to raise a small animal .
i mean to me it is .
well , one of them is real idealistic ,
but my husband and i both , i think , consider it a chore .
well , k- , kind of , mainly the woodworking i 've done lately is , uh , made like , uh , for example a little nativity scene .
i never would have thought of that .
and it 's just that it does n't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that
well a while back i was more into basketball --
and i know when my children were younger , um , we found a lot of really nice tapes that they , that they liked .
and then no one knew english in there ,
so it 's , it 's , it 's real easy to work out my schedule ,
it 's a fairly new area .
but , uh , you know , i was just , as a matter of fact , i just , uh , celebrated my fifth year at t i the end of last month and , uh , kind of started looking through the , the book because of that , you know ,
we were not sure who did n't show up with the food .
and , and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development ,
and --
i think it 's like six bucks now in the theaters ,
uh , they 'll , they 'll actually do things like this .
but --
that 's a real worry .
and i think , you know , around here , it 's all ready quit playing .
we , uh , we used to live in an apartment
it , it 's really difficult here . all because there 's always something breaking .
it 's in two parts .
so i --
it sure did
and it , but it 's an iron that he 's really practiced with .
nowadays i do n't think i could afford the boat or the time , nor do we live that close to a lake anymore ,
i worked in a factory , uh , last summer
i do n't know ,
i know a doctor once told me it , it ,
so we wanted to see what this is like .
i 'm through .
and ,
it was , it was just seventy miles .
shot a career low eighty-nine , so , and my handicap is twenty nine .
and ,
that 's what we have now ,
and they , they sure were right ,
but it certainly did n't get any better .
i do n't know if they 're making them better or not ,
a , uh , fellow when he was much younger , uh , was tried and convicted and sentenced to death .
but it sure is nice to have it --
um . there uh one of the republican the appointees for the jud- the judicial bench
he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw , but not necessarily the direction it 's going to go in .
uh , and then the week goes by
and , uh , i was thinking about that not too long ago that i used to walk
in a situation like that , i 'd say no ,
but they do n't stress that very much ,
i have four sons scattered all over the country ,
i had a sixty-six mustang ,
and , uh , so , what i do , is i bowl .
i 'm glad you said it
year old ninety-two or something like that .
and the other one i had the program running .
and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it ,
and , uh , i have a fri- , a friend who 's real good with , uh , repairing cars
so , uh , they like tia 's
i do not know how they do scale down there .
and we would like , do , just , even stupid things ,
you can use it like any other card ,
and i , i do n't , i say i do n't have the time ,
so , uh , and , uh , i was thinking , you know , like , oh my god , you know , i go back there ,
and they 're not ,
i 'm usually more the end of the season person ,
and , you know , the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him .
-- and i have young children ,
like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water , you know , that kind of thing .
like , a house burned down in this little town .
and our head football coach , dennis muir , used to be an assistant coach at b y u .
well , i sort of ,
you know for quite some time , just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty .
and ,
i mean , he really tries to , brighten up your life .
and i have seen so many people that just have to gift , you know , their belongings --
they 're already talking about it .
i mean , not that it would ,
they 're like all white ,
and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from ,
and they have more of the four seasons .
i use to think that , you know , after you work ,
they may have improved it considerably .
i mean , it 's got a taste of its own , you know ,
-- and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water --
and they did build a dam on it ,
it seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable , that are sort of like a chain , if i can use that word --
i 'd rather just be the student , .
and we , we did n't bother buying a scale ,
it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials
i mean , he was wonderful .
see i was raised in that type of family where , you know , you do n't disobey me , you mind me
um , oh , i like to listen to all different kinds of music .
and the newer ones are , i guess the newer ones are real futuristic , too ,
and , um , they said that they 're , you know , they have a little creek that runs by them
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it
i , i think i checked that as a question i 'd be willing to discuss too .
although , uh , from what i hear in the news ,
the man was let out ,
but this thing about camping that bothers me is you 've got to pack everything
and he said , well , just remember a pint is a pound the world around ,
in fact i 'm just also ,
but , but , uh , the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they 're seventy five over a cliff .
and i try to look at it .
and i used to mumblex things in my father and my husband having guns and all ,
then we got , uh , a bill saying , you know , uh , the yearly fee , it was like forty dollars .
i mean i had n't even imagined it , you know .
they 'll break in at the day , in the daytime ,
i , i play
they mixed , uh , a gallon of it
i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking --
and , uh , in the summertime i wear cotton tops .
so that does n't help us out any .
he 's getting lots of overtime ,
and , uh , i used celery seed in my ,
i see very little paper
and he lost , you know , all , all of his money before he died .
well , texas ,
i do n't want to call her a baby-sitter ,
uh , originally from new jersey .
we did it that year ,
the first time i was there , the , the tree was still standing ,
it does n't even say .
and i , i said , i want you to have control of your own business .
so i 'm , you know , part of that whole deal
i try to catch it because it 's another example ,
the only thing that i ever felt was , every time i stop and start going again , because i end up getting two jobs once in a while .
because my husband will leave every once in a while ,
so we had a real problem last year with fleas ,
uh , if your just making out a credit card application you do n't need to put down
well , i had to ,
and i was just wondering how that did work , if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show .
because there are some ,
but it 's in the estates that adjoin it .
and it was , uh , it had a lot of , uh , turtles in it .
the anti-smog pumps .
and ,
and i have been all over europe and a lot of the united states --
that 's what i was thinking .
and then it was time for them to go to bed .
we have two children ,
and where they 're going than i do beca- ,
something like that , i 've got no problem with it . uh --
and , uh , this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have x amount of million peoples financial history and information on it .
and ,
and we did that um ,
my husband would love to have more .
but it had existed for three years .
i do n't know ,
we 'd go out and just buy , you know , five pound bags of sixteen different flavors , put it in plastic shoe boxes and , and , and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something .
but i know of a number of other people who have , you know , gotten all messed up .
so i know ,
and ,
mumblex because i did n't need it .
-- that 's something i 've considered . uh ,
but , man , i , i just think of all of the money that they , that they 're going to have to spend just getting that .
-- and , uh , i now am learning to be a sys admin on , on , not only p c -s , but , uh , pers- , uh , professional work stations --
but he 's seven , uh ,
and you can just stand there and work on it .
but at least that way it is at nobody 's house , so nobody one , no one person is responsible for everything .
and , anyway , we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of ,
that was the big joke .
there 's so much going on in the world .
i guess it was january , when , um , jimmy johnson got named coach of the year or whatever .
i decided that austin is certainly someplace that i could handle living .
the prisoners of wars were , were the same as the people living in that country .
it took him about half an hour to find somebody .
and they had stopped a , uh , b- , a stolen car --
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door ,
so i get most of mine from television --
but like connecticut takes eight hours to drive home
little things that disturb me ,
he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there .
there 's one gal that 's in the , uh , plano community orchestra . uh ,
and we 're in the process
you do not have to give a telephone number .
i kind of , i resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something .
i- , in fact i work at a high school .
one person at work i know gets really into those goofy horror flicks --
now i know my boss has bought the software , um , that he can , that his checkbook is on , on --
uh , if i would just work all day long , making the clothes and everything , probably about two and a half days .
and he knows he has to
i guess he 's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it ,
a true crime story .
what we have to do is , we have to pay , uh , about twenty percent of our , uh , uh , our costs
uh , later on his reports , the reports that he studied showed that , uh , nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area- , in the class that we were looking for .
-- and they did n't get beat up .
that has to do with the weather reporting .
because a lot of time nowadays , even though you 're working , uh , you 're treated ,
he 's --
because someone says a kilogram ,
uh , it 's like in richardson you go up plano road ,
they do n't take any .
my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers
and , um , just , just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program --
i 'm still going full time ,
well , i think they are stopped blooming now , in the spring .
and if that 's the case , then you have to get your car fixed ,
we , uh , we have these classes we attend , uh , management classes
and , it will be something my kids will have , you know .
t i , you know , with the , the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have ,
and that particular state had an occupational income tax , but no sales tax .
i could carry around a little conversion card or something
he ramming his wife 's car ,
and she just turned five last month .
it had , has , uh , gold plated , uh , header .
i , at least what i hear on that one , that it 's coming out a second time in a , in a longer version --
i 've always thought about maybe transferring up there ,
so we 're in the ,
i- , i 'm only twenty-five ,
if , he , something would happen to him , i would n't stay in texas ,
i , they did n't , they did not define it ,
it makes such a difference .
oh , i definitely believe in capital --
uh , and really his , his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand .
i think i like a lot , i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music .
i do .
which makes me wonder , you know , if it 's as , uh , prevalent as , as some of them claim .
i have n't seen too many lately .
and he , he was all for it because it 's just like you say , uh ,
i think that , uh , probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else .
uh , one picks up real quick
see ours just goes in the regular trash .
and it 's really held my attention .
i 'm a engineer at , uh at the laboratory , rolm laboratory , griffis air force base , up here ,
um , i work in the computer lab at school
they were into it .
and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out ,
we 're really strict with our kids about television ,
it 's kind of scary to think , you send your child to school
and i 've always tried to do things with them , uh , like , when you 're at the little league , helping out even though i 'm not a good athlete myself ,
so i do n't have a fear of fire arms in any respect .
and he 's nice looking ,
and , and you hate to send something off with your name and address
i mean he started off as a stray
-- and she was she was , letting us know she , mumblex how , how good her daughter was .
and has a bald head
you could n't really wear a coat because it was so hot ,
um , my interests switch around dramatically .
and that is mediation training .
it is , it is very , very nice .
he 's like sixteen months old ,
um , i do mostly that , um ,
well ,
and , uh , i do n't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than , uh ,
and i think we have a couple of department stores .
we had it --
but , uh , i , i 'm more , i think i get more enjoyment just couple friends going out .
i 've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do .
and , and then they stopped funding the program there .
i , i 've seen that just in the last , uh , even five years how much they 've in , uh , increased in use . or probably eight years ,
that 's one of the things that we do .
i , i , i realize that ,
i enjoy --
she does n't have a brown nose ,
so they 're not going to be a curse to you when they 're thirteen .
it is a cream cheese , uh , uh , layering ,
i mean , dallas is a very marked up area ,
but you had to have this card ,
older than you are .
i had the money to pay for it ,
and then i just , uh , flour them , salt and pepper them and cook them .
well , i like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there .
i agree .
so it 's like when i got laid off ,
and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care . generally are not able to look after this- , themselves to very , to a very great extent , physically .
not me .
well , i need to get , get better at it .
and , uh , it 's , well , it 's not that they came in , it 's they were conquered by the germans ,
then , then we had so much fun there ,
and it just seems to fit nicely , so that i can get it read in about three days .
and , uh , the kids like to play nintendo ,
but my mother has really high cholesterol ,
and they said that t i was looking into it , to purchase extra vacation days . which i thought sounded like a good idea .
and it , it was tough ,
and --
supposed to be good , uh , recommended person from the church
and so we did that , uh ,
i assume they 're doing it for that reason .
and so i 've got to have total , almost total silence .
that 's like a buck a capsule .
um , and if you 've ever painted french doors , which my husband just finally said he was n't going to do ,
i enjoyed it .
you know , uh , channel x gives you the best coverage
but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement .
so , you know , so it 's supposed to wash , you 're supposed to be able to wash it --
but even though i love the car i 've got now , i think my next car will probably be american again --
that 's the , part they had trouble finding was wolves .
so , uh , when they chose baseball ,
but , um , i 'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff .
quite a few people were killed .
and there 's a lot of housing ,
last time i tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be jogging in p e
and it took me , i mean it took such courage you would n't believe --
i saw the family falling apart down ,
so if they just do ,
we only had one telephone , you know ,
and then they crush them .
we have , um , assistants to the general counsel
it , at times , gets incredibly hot here .
but he just does n't watch them on t v like he used to .
many of our local power plants , uh , are natural gas most of the time , uh , the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide , and n o x .
uh . university of texas in dallas .
that 's why we 've never gotten a female , you know , in anything .
i did not get the traction control which also , when you take the c- , traction control and the , and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats , too .
and we 've done , uh , we 've done quite a bit
and then like immediate family we do , like we try to do one thing once a year .
if you ever got it dumped over , though , it was a mess to get back up .
if i wanted their products , i would have either gone to the store to bought it ,
but they have snakes over there ,
young mothers .
you know , i , i ,
a friend of mine gave me a clock kit --
there 's a lot of ,
and then my cats would knock it over .
it was like that they thought that 's the way life was ,
i do n't .
you do mix the color as far as you start with , uh , white
so , i kind of think that maybe that , uh , happened to these large trees that i have .
there are , there is a receptacle , you know , at the centers also for aluminum ,
um , i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago , oh , with a just a scraper and wet sponge
and , you know , i enjoy that .
we call the t i , i 'm sorry an i b m p c compatible .
i 've seen pictures ,
i think it 's not a native texan tree .
-- and where it 's a very large town ,
we 'll catch our news that way .
they , they designed it and everything ,
i guess in my spare time i 'll be making t shirts .
well , they 're showing uh , live and let die at this moment ,
i , i know with our , our long winters i , i enjoy watching it .
and it was wonderful .
i used to do that ,
we both have a budget ,
i got a mickey mouse print is what i got .
i 'm , i saw her in the keys ,
i have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids .
i have n't ever called .
she has leukemia --
the kids are so wonderful .
i 'm , i 'm a free-lance writer right now .
but neither of them wound up going over , which , i think they were very happy for .
and they 've got entire squadrons of those just standing by .
but --
i do n't .
but it just ,
quite often just scan through the headlines
the police drove up just as he fired the g- , gun and killed the guy .
you know , being that i 'm not in the , that area i really do n't know .
i never have .
i 'm just a regular looking guy ,
so i wonder how , you know , somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun . you know , in the aspect that we see it .
-- it 's got to have more than that --
i just do n't give ,
and , um , as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in dallas-fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home ,
just work ,
and they 've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink , unless you get there at five o'clock ,
and then i buy the bibs separate .
uh , well , uh , we do n't have any children
one of the calls i 'd gotten before was , uh , down to austin
and , and , and they do n't want to have anymore children because they just do n't think , you know , that , she does n't think she could be a mother at home .
we just , we had two baseball bleachers full of people ,
and so we 've found good use for those .
so i missed a lot of sundays during --
i , i have a suzuki motorcycle
he 's the little boy pomeranian .
and , uh , or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to , uh , to the office .
well , it 's got a back up system that does n't work supposedly . tha- , uh , that if it 's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway . supposedly .
and get some fresh air in the house
but like , uh , i lived in oakland , uh , until just recently --
i ought to go looking through some of my old mail .
i , i do n't know maybe other people ,
and so i have n't been able to quit yet .
they said that every yard has some --
-- and they just pay the minimum required balance .
i happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the , that tub stuff ,
i did not .
i , i see the packages on it , uh , that are available
oh , i 've , i 've been trying , uh , uh , a mixture of , uh , the bermuda and the rye ,
and we went camping on vacations .
but once i got used to it , it was habit forming .
i mean , it , it definitely it 's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver
and here they are , they 're always used to these old fashioned foods .
and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a mumblex job .
i --
and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both ,
but , or , you know , if you want to have open windows , to be able to op ,
my children , our children are grown --
if i ca n't understand the words i do n't want to listen to it .
all these kids have these really supportive , really supportive parents , always up there for --
it 's just amazing ,
uh , i guess i 've always kind of liked golf .
well , i 'm , um , going to be certified as an english teacher mumblex teach english as a second language .
then my father got us some tickets ,
and he said that the banks were calling ,
i have never seen catfish , you know , except in fi- , filleted on a plate , i think maybe .
and i mean , that is one big thing down here .
but , it was when i was a child .
and it was for a murder trial .
and i probably ,
and then make movies out of some of them .
but washington is one of my favorite places to visit .
but , um , now i 've noticed that like , while i 'm at college , and when i go home , my bro- , you know , my ,
but it 's , uh , it 's just fabulous food .
i like it when they will do something and not get too silly .
and i just thought that they done broke up and --
-- and we tried it .
and that 's all they 'd have to do .
and then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that , ho hum , whatever ,
and there 's a ton of clothes always , you know left over
uh , we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began .
and , uh , i would , uh , collect the corn very carefully , ear by ear ,
we were what ,
and they , you do n't know if it 's a man or a woman .
i think the longest we 've stayed out there is like five days .
there 's only so much i can do for them ,
you drive up
that 's my biggest gripe about living here .
i 'm not so sure what kind of , uh , training that is for the future for those kids .
-- you do n't run into that up here , i think , i think because there 's so many , uh , professional people , if you want to call them that --
it 's a two story house ,
and , and , uh , i 've done pretty good at it .
and he 's at work ,
my wife talks with other people ,
i ca n't even really remember .
i wanted to see that .
you know , there is motivation around there
and williams is about seven .
of course now , when you go down there , you know , i mean , they 've got just ,
i do n't try and pay them off .
the , uh , united states and canada are i guess , is , is , going into , uh , some types of agreements to limit , uh , what 's being given out by power plants ,
and i guess they got convicted , the four , of --
i really do n't go to very many concerts .
i do n't , i do n't like to , you know , i like to save the editorial information or the , the politically , uh , weighted information , you know , for the , for a different section .
he did n't even tell us .
and then my , my parents live in greenville ,
but i put all the money into it .
where i lived . uh , it was a little town called newmarket .
i do n't , i do n't want to probably talk to them some more discuss it ,
and all those variegated , uh , things died .
i , i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because , you know , he is out working trying to make some money for , you know , we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth , you know .
and , uh , actually i work for the f b i .
i did n't realize they had no state tax in texas .
uh , live in an apartment complex .
i was much younger .
in fact , uh , her , uh , uh , experiences were , were invaluable --
not one of my favorite hobbies
but probably not .
sales i find are a pain .
uh , i mean , my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty .
we , i think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose , um , this area is that , um , my husband was raised in irving --
and , uh , so that 's , that 's what we went for first
at least i always did but although actually , my , i like the mountains .
your car is fuming
it took that long .
i mean , she 's paying , i do n't know , i do n't know what per month , you know , forty , fifty dollars per month in interest --
even if we have the ,
like , try to get some place and exercise from five to six ,
he , he does n't have any front claws ,
and he 's two now ,
i mean --
toyota , uh ,
you know , it 's really a nice stay . uh ,
i will have to try that .
and with that kind of a system my daughter just is n't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down ,
let 's see , i ca n't think of anything else --
and it tells you
everyone else has been a female ,
we have a cat , stripper .
i would n't mind having , oh , more votes than i get to have , frankly .
apparently the trucks that they had , um , lined up , they needed the parts for ,
and , they seem to do fine .
it was really neat ,
you have these people who are serial killers that did n't even get the death sentence back when --
it 's , uh , i think once or twice a week .
i enjoy it myself .
but i think it 's like , about sixty dollars a week for two children --
he used to work at , uh , uh , university of texas at d- ,
and right now in our area we 're fighting against a toxic waste incinerator .
that was pretty good .
and there 's , it 's completely generic .
uh , i have one neighbor that 's , uh , the father is a fireman
and they will do the alum- ,
-- i mean , you know , uh , it has a lot less fat .
and most of the time it is .
and he , uh , he works about an hour and a half away from here , from our home ,
and it 's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that .
i have n't .
what i 've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report --
we were laughing ,
so we did n't have to do any painting .
and i would go in ,
and that did get us so that , you know , the house is paid for and , uh , other major things are taken care of
and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said , what are you going to do
i had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie
i found it a lot of times with , regards to education , you know , the school only takes you so far , you know .
we do like eggo waffles and stuff like that ,
and , you know , he has all that
the other two cats i have are outdoor cats .
and what i found out is , if you look at the bottom of those bags , kroger or whatever --
and i just , i think it 's the best thing .
and the doctor called me up and said , uh , she had a low white cell count and that , uh , she was n't , she was dying and , uh , suggested that i take her to a working hos- , dog hospital , animal hospital .
oh , i saw that .
you know . and that 's , that 's the way i ,
i keep telling them it 's the same mentality you know ,
you can always refuse
because i mean , you had to pay it in full every month .
and every year we learn one more thing that we did n't know before . like about these mums .
the guy was caught burgling ,
i know , uh ,
and then it finally went out of business .
and , uh , he do n't know me usually .
and , uh , they 're , they 're expanding it to , uh , more counties here . uh , as the population spreads out
and of course it 's real convenient , because it is right there at work .
but , uh , as far as missing living there , no .
because , actually , when you , when you do , uh , service overseas you end up learning something , usually that 's , that 's really useful , plumbing , or farming , or , or something like that ,
and he works , mostly with adolescents .
um , i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting , when i do have spare time .
but normally i collect , oh , like three trash bags full --
you know , we do n't have that much of it now .
the third world countries are less industrial
well there 's good cholesterol and there 's bad cholesterol .
i should know
i either want to do it in the fall or spring .
and they , would level entire areas .
i was ,
i guess that 's one thing that i particularly like , um .
or they will kno ,
oh , that 's it ,
and you do n't have to wait ,
-- but it 's kind of fun .
i have n't done this in a couple months .
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood , he has done his house
i 'm sure , you know , my sentimental favorite would have to be philadelphia ,
and i just realized i had never read it growing up .
and --
so it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
-- and , uh , i bought that used .
and it 's , it 's a deep trunk , but not as broad as the , uh , the cadillac .
but with not a whole lot of discretionary money , it 's kind of hard to figure out how to do it .
we 've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis
the whole family was so disappointed .
but they 're spaced out , oh i 'd say maybe three , on a two block period .
it is before one of the , i think it is before the first baptist in sherman airs .
and , uh , even though it was older , it was , it was real comfortable and ,
but , but i was out of the country when , uh , my , my son was little .
i ,
but then at the ver , in the fourth quarter they 'd let them get up there either with them or , you know , right ahead of them .
but , i always get a lot of my information from the ,
it 's not step for step .
um , we have one dog , a bichon frise .
-- and again , it 's not , it 's not cheap to rent the lodge up there --
and they were all mumblex to her at the vatican city and would n't let her perform in rome ,
as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house .
and my wife was carrying a different one .
and it , basically , it was something that a military guy had ordered and had n't picked up ,
oh , that 's probably why ,
and you wonder if he 's going to get shot .
and they , they put this one out
well , i found , uh , that , in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned ,
he 's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes .
and i think in the nursing home that i worked for ,
we 're career
and it 's , you know , it 's put up
um , but i do know through some organized groups like scouts and church --
we got two fifty last year --
it 's partially because i can work on them .
-- and the good guys can get hit all day long --
uh , when i do though i , i have some friends that i always like to experiment on .
-- oh , gosh and it 's so hard because , you know , everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done ,
we ca n't either .
i shudder .
i do n't know how that 's going to affect , uh ,
having ,
it 's very pleasant .
and now i 've , for about the last eight years i 've sung in a church choir here ,
and , um , we , you know , we had blocks and stuff ,
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop , you know --
i got this cough ,
they will recommend their shepherds as a children 's dog .
in fact , uh , one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to chopin , that is played on , uh , piano .
you , you probably put down , you know , you had drixoral or contact if you would remember that you did it .
but she 's in a --
you know , there 's mountains
there are some areas though where , where they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit --
we do have , uh , cable ,
and this , you know , s- , frog strangler that we used to call them ,
i mean when someone comes in ,
this is a package of dates mind you ,
and , um , so since the house did burn , they 're , they 're going ,
but , uh , then i quit work and everything
so when the computer picked this one , i was a little bit surprised ,
and after about six hours , you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there ,
i just want to kill her at --
i think it was like ,
you know , it 's not sandy like most of the state is ,
did it myself .
so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic , time to get into work ,
-- and it was hotter there than it was here .
dursban ,
but i still find some of the same tapes , i , uh , some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy .
well i guess that 's fluoro- , the fluorocarbons --
my family , uh , my parents are the youngest of very large families .
they have a new one now .
uh , the walls were , uh , uh ,
and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that 's held annually at a big mall here .
you get the crabs --
all those underwater scenes .
but i do n't , i do n't read newspapers .
and at the same time , the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases ,
and , uh , then we got this new cat ,
we wound up selling the house .
well , course i went through this , uh , what , about five years ago .
we got a baby-sitter
that , that 's , that 's the state that got , was famous when they executed somebody .
and they 're very good --
and it was really nice out there .
and then you had a physical , where you were drug tested ,
and as i said , as far i 'm concerned , it , it has been extremely , uh , uh , serviceable and everything i wanted .
it 's maybe once a year or something
that 's all beyond my imagination really .
she 's studying , she 's going into law ,
but as long as i wa- , w- , you know , was going to work i was going to do as , as much as i could ,
and , you know , when i left there , we paid six cents on the dollar ,
but , uh ,
and fortunately it was just like a retriever
so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each , with each paycheck ,
-- and so , you know , i do --
so they could n't , they ca n't hide anything on you or anything like that .
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley .
it was , uh , during teddy roosevelt 's time .
but the , the problem that we 've , we 've owned this house almost five years now ,
and we 've been down in texas eighteen years ,
you know , we only find out about that a year after the fact .
i do n't know if i feel , i do n't feel real strongly about that .
because just about six months ago someone came to my front door , rang the doorbell .
and i , plus i have it , uh , in the living room
that 's a department store .
and you know , we had all the necessities ,
and he let her out ,
and then , you know , so i eventually got it all paid .
i 'm actually from amarillo , texas , originally .
i mean , you know , if it 's just downright , outright ,
and , uh , either if it 's a drum or , or disc brakes , i enjoy working on those kind of things .
and so , we , uh , i was just looking ,
we did not know italian .
th- , that 's , of course , being facetious
but i wish we could do more .
i do n't have anybody to teach me either .
and i guess it was late may ,
um , i , i really have been pleased with plano .
uh , well i think , either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point --
and since they 've moved to where they are , they let the cat out .
well , we see that a lot out here in utah ,
so i 'm pretty satisfied myself .
but we 're about two hours from the coast .
you know , rains a little too often .
if they would just quit blowing it .
so , back in my old job , up until through nineteen eighty --
you can buy that
i do n't think they like the fact that i have one either .
i know .
i saw some promise , you know , with , with a lot of the new wave , when it , when it came out , uh ,
uh , my oldest two are already out and about in the world
uh , it 's got an office down here in , uh , in , near duncanville
have n't taken it yet , though .
there 's no .
got up everything .
so that was really fun .
i think we would get bored on the boat all the time .
and they changed all the facts that they said it was true --
not speaking in english , um , having the children drive them everywhere , and these were not old people .
well , maybe it is n't in utah .
but that , that worked out very nicely too .
we did , um , last year , though , go to san antonio for memorial day --
i 'm allergic to grass .
uh , so , then a couple years ago i found , uh , a bank here in plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was , you can get a visa card through them and no annual membership .
and i got about two , two-thirds of it done ,
i , i mean i have to ad , confess to that .
and they , they refuse to give him more salary .
well , i , i work the same way .
well , the carpenter and painter and , you know , everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built ,
and , uh , they have a policy for , uh , testing .
i think she is a freshman .
i have n't .
so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and , uh , you know , get a replacement part .
an- , and i do n't know if the kids nowadays are different than what ,
the engine blew up in it ,
the thing is , uh , when we moved in they had just , uh , painted , wallpa- , we 're , you know , wallpapered , new carpet and everything
ours is the same
it was ,
so that 's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together .
you know , i presently ,
-- and it stopped in dallas for half an hour , so i loaded the kids in the car ,
and then on the nights i can watch , i 'll pick out something .
and then she grew to be , you know ,
they say it has really made a difference , though .
so that kind of bothered him --
we have separate bins --
to me , all this , uh , space exploration that we 've done thus far has told us that there 's no other place like earth . that , uh , we ca n't live on mars .
noth- , nothing overly strenuous .
and , uh , if , if the child is , is pretty straight forward , um , she 's fine .
but , like i say , i , i would n't care because i , i do n't , i do n't even smoke
i did n't want to .
so . uh , i started anchoring last , uh , anchoring , uh ,
and that was really , really disturbing ,
i think so .
and i needed basic , really simple education that you can get , pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years .
but it 's mostly oaks
but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen .
chicago has a lot of good stations , uh ,
-- so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home --
and he did n't realize he was touching poison ivy
i have , my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers --
so i went through it .
but , uh , i ca n't do as much as i used to ,
i --
and it 's much nicer .
it , it makes me feel like , well , there may be something left for my children , my nieces and nephews and so forth .
um , the gardens are kind of old ,
i 'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas .
i know , my wife and i were first married here
then , and i , i usually put the cut up tomatoes next --
and when i went to college i think everything in my closet , i had made .
i 'm trying to study for that now .
i was just listening to a program this morning ,
but it 's like , oh , heavenly .
and it was quite a production .
. i did --
the , in fact , they 've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten , which means they probably wo n't get into the top elementary and , and high school ,
some friends would take care of the kids ,
a , a masters in , uh , information systems .
and i do .
so they had a really nice balance .
but , i know , oh , well , i guess , they have their crowds , like during the soap operas , you know , like in between classes or something --
and so we 're still shopping ,
like i was in michael 's the other night and charged something ,
it was so much fun .
i have often thought that , that having one at home would be neat .
but i do n't anymore , maybe once or twice a year .
i know where you , i know the area .
you never see them on a , on nationally basketball .
all my friends , they , their parents worked all the time ,
and he really , this man really shed some light on , um , some ,
taco bell .
we 've been doing it ourselves for most of the time , uh , find that it 's really a little more economical ,
because there was one that it was really handy to have .
there was a , there was a case about two years ago --
even a bad school is a good school up here , where , if i lived in new york city or washington , d c , uh , i would seriously consider moving if i had a child .
i mean , not all the time .
i think they 're wonderful .
and i have the same problem ,
and you 're doing a whole lot better , you know ,
and i say , jeez , you know , this is the first year it 's been so perfect .
and my family is from ohio
it was n't really health related .
-- and so , uh , we really want four or five bedroom house
they 're my babies .
well , that 's all i really know about recycling .
oh , well , that 's my husband 's side and my mom , my mom 's , or my family , uh ,
that 's it ,
in our state right now , uh , recently they 've had a lot of , uh , uh , the rapists , uh , murder type , uh , killers going around
i could n't , you know --
you do a lot more area than i do .
and i 'm like , um , but , uh , i have n't seen one yet either
and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all ,
that was the super bowl .
and , uh , so i was n't directly involved
they talked about her ,
he 's , he 's black
but , we do it mainly for , you know , the cash flow ,
i talked to , a guy the other day
but i kind of , i liked it some ways
i have n't talked to , uh , i have n't talked to a whole lot of black people on it
but it was all , uh , really expensive .
i , uh --
i 'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings .
but i do n't even know if they 're still new york yankees ,
you 're going to have to ,
i know that some of the schools they have , uh , country western day or something like that one , you know , or tacky day ,
so they started , uh , dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees --
i travel on the road
but , uh , i guess the bicycling is the one thing i 'll sort of , like , do if i feel like i need to go exercise .
i do n't know how many people actually pay the whole shot .
you know they been advertising that
the only other things that i 've ever had trouble with , uh ,
and if i 'd pop in unexpectedly , i discovered , you know , they did a little bit , they did better .
they 're all grown up
i probably wo n't make anything beyond this blanket .
well , i , i figure it takes practice
i did n't know that .
and it 's all got to line up .
i have a child who , uh ,
so i have got myself ,
and i just kind of tell my kids how much i hate paying interest
however , i 'm a product of the new york city public school system from fifty years ago ,
as long , it 's like well ,
it 'd be like , it 'd been like deactivated as far as --
and they only work nine months a year
and i 'm just trying to determine , you know , how you address , how you weigh , you know , rodney getting , getting the hell beat out of him against , you know , forty deaths .
and , uh , so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that 's
-- it sort of has a bob tail .
i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com- , or my wife and my daughter going into combat --
and electric windows , and power locks .
so i 'm trying .
of course , we 're not talking about politics ,
uh , i 'm not sure about pennsylvania , whether we have it or not .
and then there 's a very large hispanic population there .
i , i favor dogs over cats actually
the war that just went on .
it ,
and this is his first year ,
so i 've calmed down everything except , i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the , um , walking ,
we , we do , uh , um , well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill co- , bond wire on --
it , it 's really more fun than anything
i thought it was okay .
so i was doing linguistic work actually , travelling around , finding out about languages , and --
and i tell you , really , i could just kick myself for even starting it , because i have a feeling i 'm never going to get it done .
-- i really do .
i watched that cause he was cute .
and i would love ,
but she made arrangements , so that when she was gone ,
and ,
and he said , um , let 's give her some race horse shots .
the part where they 're shooting mercy .
um , you know , there 's real no , no real dress code where i work .
i thought , oh , boy , do i have a pet .
and --
you know , if i want something intellectual , i usually read a book .
i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there .
all the ones that are already retired .
well , we usually start them right in the house .
i have n't followed it real closely at all . uh , except like i said , last year when the world series rolled around , i did , i did follow that pretty religiously .
but just think of all the , the , all the lawyers you 've kept employed ,
and then we had a p g a , actually , a very big p g a , uh , tour stop here , last year .
like it 's about a fifth of what it used to be --
we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop
so i 'm just doing it all myself .
but i know , they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance ,
and that was the place to go to get your t v -s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that .
so it 's kind of like drawing this line
you do have to pay , you know , if you ,
uh , i have a boyfriend
you have to go the house , the congress , and all of the o- , other things --
i mean , um , that made me think of , uh , when our daughter was looking at colleges , we visited a campus in , um , saint louis
we have a household budget .
and , you know , mumblex presidents have always avoided that --
so .
and it will start then ,
and when i signed up for it , it , uh , looked like it could be , make a real contribution in participating .
you know , i do n't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away ,
and i belong to the user 's group
you did n't notice it at first ,
like around , i think it 's a little past or it 's right before midway , or it 's --
they do .
i mean , you know , they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they 're going to , uh , enact this i think , uh , the , um , other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling
uh , i 'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door .
and i love it .
uh , we 're maybe one hundred miles from pittsburgh ,
i do n't ,
uh , responsibilities is what i am trying to say .
i we , we read bruce mumblex book before we went , you know ,
hope , hopefully the new , uh , education , secretary of education will do something to fix the problem
she --
swimming one day .
i have n't seen that one .
-- we like to watch that .
uh , i guess i look at , uh , getting the best deal .
but , um , i produce quite a bit of trash ,
very little .
so we had a nice thing going there ,
that 's really great .
-- probably mumblex at all .
they cover the headlines ,
and , you know --
so that was their thinking .
and , uh , sometimes what richardson and plano both ,
uh , of course , you have to have some sort of record in high school , uh , of , of achievement and everything ,
so maybe there 's something along that same line where , you know , in all these financial , uh , applications that you make out , you do n't have to put all that stuff down there .
and ,
but , uh , i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying , two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a child which is about a year old ,
and a lot of time , i find it during the day when , when i 'm rocking my little girl to sleep ,
-- so that would be nice .
uh , my husband 's retired from i r s agents .
but , uh --
well , i 've gone to , you know , one for real live trek convention
so . it 's just crazy .
and i do it per paycheck for me --
in fact , i have a daughter who is in a , a , who just graduated in civil engineering , from college .
i love classical music ,
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where ,
i , i 'd like to go down to mexico , you know ,
caddo lake .
i mean , th- , that 's why i like to read sports illustrated so much
at least since they 've redone it , supposedly redone .
but --
and i though about it a lot
it 's actually just twelve years old , now .
and then i 'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we ca n't do it back home .
grab ,
and , um , up there there was no , no place that we went tasted like real mexican food to me .
-- and , um , i had to wear a dress every day ,
-- but they 're pretty good about it if she wants other time off .
i , if i have a minute that 's what i , i do .
i have about three books that i am going on .
and --
ranch style home , i shou , i would hate to think that anybody thought , uh , the lot we live on as a ranch .
he 's , he 's from canada .
i do n't know why we have so much going for us ,
there is a , there is a bad , uh , uh , you know , the old brash or ugly american-type ,
the places we 've gone they sing in the original languages .
i , i can remember as a child , you know , nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go .
and we ge , you know , vacation normally after you 're here for six months
well , they , they , who- , --
it wo n't be a ford .
well , they 'll be air-conditioning anyway
and , uh , in general though i 've , i 've been really disappointed with a lot --
and of course they had a lot of musicians from , from other countries --
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit .
but i still have to figure out .
i 'm ready when you are .
but , uh , uh , it , it just , there 's little enclaves down there where , you know , americans have a lot of influence
uh , mostly i do needlepoint , i guess .
you know , i wish they could have gotten a lottery .
and uh --
well , i got a patio ,
and i guess , i , i live near washington , being in , in baltimore , it 's something like one in four people ,
well , actually i 've found out that i 'm not going to go back to being an engineer .
they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers , instead of , they said , all these gangs kids could join to belong .
and then , uh , you just put it in the oven ,
i 'm never had to protect my life or ,
we 're just , you know , it 's like we just woke up ,
so , i 'm , uh , i just love to sew
and , and i like to just add picante sauce to get the mexican flavor
well i grew up out in the country and , uh , was used to having , uh , guns around the place
well , i think the six is called a grand jury
their , the mexican kids get a good education along the way ,
so they took some time off that , uh , they could show us around .
but i 've got out of the habit of listening to the radio .
my kids are going to be hating me ,
drop things off one at a time ,
i get a so- , i get a sore neck from looking up all the time , yeah , things like that --
they did n't care about what went on .
uh , that 's the first i 've ever heard of it .
i have a baby ,
i 'm nineteen floors up --
and they 'll just wear your common , ordinary , you know , whatever you might --
i always used the nice wide masking tape ,
but , uh , it 's just really an incredible thing .
i ca n't see good enough , you know ,
where was the person last night --
he , he loves my son ,
but it has a , a engine in the back --
i , we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in --
and when i look at modern cars and stuff like that , i just say i will never do that with the modern cars .
because the ones that are n't so good do n't , just do n't make it .
and , and sometimes we 've gone
and i said what the hell is going on here , you know .
i 've been just a recipient .
and people do n't see that either .
and , you know we set up ...
but you , uh ,
and i do n't know ,
and then the disk drive is two fifty .
it 's not very expensive , uh ,
and i mean , if you think about it , you know , i c , i still can have another career .
and i hope that i will become a better , make a better difference in ,
i played a little bit of piano .
so , i 've worked for them for several years , like twelve now , i guess .
but just enough that his bite is off a little bit
but , you know , you leave out of there
a long time .
there was big brother , big sister ,
lots of times .
well , i think for me ,
i 've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably would n't have if i 'd stayed up north , you know .
we like it because it 's fairly reasonable
but it 's , uh , changing latitude .
and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process .
-- and , uh , i have caught one or two small sharks --
because i can just see brushing up against it , that it would --
and it 's , it 's fun ,
those people simply did not have access to safety , to security
that was n't , uh , that was a big deal ,
and , uh , i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death ,
uh , things have become much more enlightened since then .
to try to make them more effective and useful .
it would be --
t i has that ,
i have a son and a daughter ,
we 're talking about capital punishment .
they 're up and doing fine .
and he , he 's , uh , he wants to go into engineering .
so i hope they do n't sue us over it .
you ca n't do anything ,
and , uh , so , and then the kids were getting older and , and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside .
and i had the ability to , to go in summer school ,
one thing about the houses in , uh , in dallas , they do n't , uh , utilize basements the way they did in new york .
i , on the other hand , se- ,
-- and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time ,
well , uh , we , we , as you do , take family vacations , uh , sometimes one a year ,
once a year , i get a free airplane ride that way .
so i , uh , you know , i had more suits and stuff then
defending your life .
i never do .
and , um , her families always have this food she grew up in ,
i do .
if he would buy her a motor home .
he is , uh ,
i try not to make too much .
and everybody had duties --
and i kept getting rid of them ,
you know , they had an abridged version of it on tape .
they 've got research triangle park here ,
but , uh , aside from --
um , it 's not one of the bigger ones . it 's probably , um , i compare it to the size of plano , maybe a little smaller .
i ca n't hear them .
he still has his driver 's license here ,
lubbock is ,
and , you know , we have a swimming pool at our house
but i ca n't relate to football because i 've never ,
now , i can appreciate that , especially after what happened in vietnam .
and it 's really small .
when i , when i go on vacation , my father and i , uh --
but hopefully , hopefully next week i 'll get back to my normal routine .
and i 'm not saying they 're bad people ,
but , uh , i do make her come in .
i do a lot --
all set .
i think once we get into a place , it will be just fine ,
but if , if they missed it , they had to abide by the rules .
we named him , uh , we named him buddy after , uh , buddy bell , uh , the ranger baseball player that used to be here .
i have , i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago ,
i mean , i did some of it ,
i think it was like a five year deal with , uh --
i know , um ,
i mean i 'm not a women 's libber by any means ,
well , t i was getting , for the both of us , it was like seventy-five dollars a month .
here name is lori , bird .
we 're supposed to talk about crime in the city .
i really never had anything major with my mazda
they 're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun . where they 're , uh , looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the , basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust .
me too .
and just kind of brings that support up in the sma- ,
and it 's a chance to see some of the relatives you do n't see all year long --
i mean , i have n't been watching my watch .
we , uh , we had a small accident with our mini van --
but , uh , i think he 's the only one that 's , that 's caught enough crappie or , a big enough crappie to eat .
it was , it was annoying .
i 'm trying to think ,
and it depends where he 's going whether or not i decide to go along --
i thought , well i was doing them a favor by taking them .
i hope so .
when , uh , the kids were in high school , it was harder to always have supper together ,
well , i know , uh , that 's been the concern in europe .
but , uh , i was just talking to somebody else ,
and i think this , this year we , uh , i think we used it for christmas ,
i know i , i tend to , i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it 's very temperate .
and you do n't pay them . if you live there ,
uh , i really do n't have a routine .
you know that 's it .
well , maybe that 's what i 'll do when i have time later on ,
th- , the other thing when you said , we do n't have cable t v , so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is , is called c span .
it 's not free ,
and you feel comfortable with it .
and so ,
the times herald is the one that closed up .
but --
my kids want to see rescuer 's down under --
and before that it 's been quite a few years .
and not just that , i try to , well , that 's a big part of it . i try to get my money 's worth .
and i 'm for college .
-- and i always , i really appreciated that . having her there when i was , you know , when i came home from school and when i worked ,
because i , i was told by several people that it 's pretty scary and intense --
so , i do n't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies .
an we got him a new one ,
and it 's a , a , a biography ,
it had to be spent .
then i 'm home to pick her up .
i understand .
but it was this little bitty one bedroom house ,
it was like you 'd go out in the yard to water something , you 'd just be standing still .
well , i find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children . because ,
now the interior ,
and that 's kind of the way i was raised .
maybe we need to go outside ,
so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider --
they do .
actually , i 'm doing this for somebody else but , you know , for a friend of mine .
uh , on my job we had a lot of workmen 's comp cases
and i finally decided one semester , i 'm in college and i 'm taking night classes and i still do n't have any of my p e classes ,
she does it all now for about ten years ,
and , uh , it was , uh , one of those generation novels , you know --
um , most of the lawyer programs like , uh , law and order ,
and we start out with evening shade --
and i realize that that , i mean , i can take that for granted
but ,
it really has been strange here this year ,
so , i 'm in the computer business .
that company is not allowed to sent it , you any junk mail .
tha , it 's like a call in survey that says , you know , do you think so
i mean , but again it 's a set amount every month .
and he 's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up , um , ha , having been involved with drugs .
killing lots of fire ants .
we are supposed to talk about places we like to go .
if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find , if i was close to home , relatives or people with it is same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as , as parents .
well , i , i have a ,
i do n't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not .
but i had missed it .
we 're very ,
ninety ,
i would travel everywhere
well , at that time , actually , i had a volkswagen rabbit --
so , we were each limited to like twenty minutes a day , you know ,
-- but , yeah , oh , i was really trying to think .
she , just , well
and then , seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff .
and you 'd have to change your height on your driver 's license .
they like to eat it ,
i worked at mcdonald 's as well ,
you know , i , i wonder ,
and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on .
because i was n't really like listening to the world go by back then
i guess i got too many hobbies
he is quite noisy .
but i went with someone ,
but , you know , if we had , if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around , like you say on , on the highway , or where , where it was n't ,
and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool , because the water was so awful ,
but after awhile it always seems that the , um , oh , the site starts to leak
our church has a place ,
and so now , i , i feel lucky actually because i 've almost lived around everyone .
uh , scalloped potatoes .
so i usually try to combine it with , uh , catching a couple of games somewhere .
the , um , thing that , that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar --
well , i know jack godfrey .
um , but i 've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor , so that every time i get up to bowl , i have to bend over to pick up my towel
uh , i have a sixty-nine cougar and a seventy-seven pontiac , so forth ,
i mean , they eat , they eat a lot of carbohydrates , and not much fat .
well , i 've , i have had some because i was working for p i e ,
so , i do n't mess with it .
and it 's turned out that , that 's been very true , what he was forecasting about the accumulation of , of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage .
when you 're saying as far as the appeal , uh , procedure was concerned .
and then in the winter time it 's jeans or , or pants .
she is more wrinkled .
and , and then , and yet they have their , their friendships and relationships and the , you know , of getting together and eating together and all of that .
uh , we 'll go get pizza and , uh , at little caesar 's , although the kids prefer domino 's .
they probably give you a chance to explain yourself --
i said okay fine , i , i will , i will .
and , uh , people go there to be abused .
and she interviews ,
and that was even just with two people .
i do n't know what she calls them in
and , um , it had been recommended by some friends of ours
i s- , i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and , and lawn additives and that type of thing ,
oh , i have n't been there either .
and we said let 's go to new orleans .
and the people would be standing there in gas masks ,
and , you know , other then that i 'm sure they watched ,
and you know they are --
that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van .
so they were ...
he 's only about , i guess he 's about two and a half in his real understanding of things .
-- and , uh , i run a concert band ,
uh , i , i work for t i .
oh my husband 's going upstairs ,
you know , that 's , that 's totally out .
k o a -s are wonderful .
i am in , i am in washington d c .
and it , and it fits right on your , uh , st- , it fits right on your burner , whether it 's gas or electric
and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i 'm sure he breathed it --
it 's by , um , boise .
and --
i work in the news business
i got to shovel it all , lots of fun .
and it 's not , you know , we do n't promote it a lot outside the community because we do n't want recognition for it , you know --
and --
i 'm just going to be fifteen years this year
that 's a , just a great place . but no colora- , not in colorado
and --
just , just the drive up through , uh , up the coast line --
i think when we went to england and france , we were there ten , twelve days ,
and i can afford that .
uh , we are in the process of trying to buy a house ,
but she 's still changes her mind two or three times ,
and he wants to be best friends --
uh , only thing i can think is bleaching
i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who , uh , were adequately deficient in their abilities , uh --
and that 's why i do n't mind paying more .
and then after one year it started heating only on one side .
i did cut down a lot .
i do n't know how you combat that .
it had a different feel to it .
he 's a delayed child .
i , i live with , um , a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us .
it 's thirty miles .
like if , like my age , if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party , no , i , they would shell their own ,
that helps a whole bunch .
-- now i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to ,
and it had a built in , uh , grill
well , have , have probably like , like a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding .
but i ca n't even do that because of the alarm .
and i 'll know the answer today ,
-- uh , i , i like things that , uh , are , are wholesome , i guess .
-- typically the mother was at home with , uh , the children and ,
actually , my , my wife and i are actually thinking , contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so .
well , not in my family .
so we do n't watch , uh , that type of show ,
so , that 's a possibility .
and it pretty much is in the middle of summer .
i 'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime .
and we 've , you know , done away with our , quote , fair share number .
my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown , though .
he 'll either bark for food , or he 'll bark to go out
and this time we 're going to be going with just one daughter
america 's paying all this money to have other people give , uh , aid to other countries ,
so i was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and k- , that kind of stuff .
i like k r l d .
i , uh , i only started doing it after , uh , i started getting calls and said , oh , heck ,
i do n't read as much as i would like to either .
and then they go off and do other things during the summer .
so i sent back all of mine , except the ones that were free .
you know , i went to college late on in life
and i get into , uh , newspapers ,
it 's about a black singing group .
well , see , this , this is what concerns me .
and i 'll mix ,
and i am like , you are the one who signed up .
oh , i did n't know that .
i guess our , our , my biggest memory is when we froze to death .
i , i do n't know it just seems like , uh , you know , for what we 've put into it i feel like that 's something that might retain it 's value a little bit more ,
-- the , the , the company that i work for , uh , has just recently , well , you know , within the last couple of years , instituted for all new hired employees ,
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living .
i forgot the name of it .
he still charges you that hundred dollars .
but that 's why they 're there and not me .
but purely just for enjoyment ,
it 's , it 's a plate that fits in , you know , into the smoke pipe --
but amazingly it 's like , uh , massachusetts went back ,
and , uh --
i think i would be like ,
i am --
oh , i never even knew that .
we 've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going .
and so i have a little more contact with that .
and , uh , i 'm just finishing another one up on , uh , statistical sampling ,
and i had a friend of mine going ,
but we have --
and he held the camera out as the tornado went by .
i used to live in georgia
but it 's just , it closed recently .
i mean i , i would have had so ,
and , you know , they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that .
i mean the stuff i 've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit , uh , overstated . that a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all .
she had already picked it up .
well , see we have the testing already here .
usually when we have a dinner party , i always , i like to grill .
they 're , they 're , uh , it 's like a little house except the whole face is open ,
she 's , she 's not even a year yet ,
and it 's got a good historical perspective to it .
well , the air conditioning was broke ,
i am not into soap , soaps and all that stuff .
i 'm so sick and tired of that .
we took our grandsons and went , uh , the weekend before last ,
you know , world music takes the forms that have really been , um ,
i use to work at anteks .
and then i do n't , usually do n't exceed that unless i , unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if i have car expenses
and i thought , well now , here you have a student who is trying to pass , who is struggling with your subject
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice .
and we have n't discussed this at all . um .
some of them , some of them moved back and forth ,
they just get around and , and talk techy or , or else , uh , uh , you know ,
uh , and that , and that was , you know , that 's , that , that 's certain you can do in thirty minutes .
you know , i was going home the other day
i would just take her the actual paperwork once , uh , every week or two ,
cape cod style , i guess you 'd --
it 's just my husband and i , too --
well , that was my experience going through junior high up there
they , uh , luckily we have a , a man who owns a building company .
but , i also get the new york times and the wall street journal .
and she soon realized , you know ,
we saw it at the movies ,
look at your map later and see the , the town of amarillo --
and so getting out and being active , uh , is , uh , uh , helps out .
and , uh --
well there are some kind of nice prizes ,
and , uh , a whole bunch of peop- ,
i broke my heel .
i mean , you got to , you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what 's going to happen .
they were following him home from the motorcycle shop .
they are gathering a data base for voice processing .
but i do n't know whether you need an , a unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty to acquit .
i 'm in rome , new york .
he , he , do- , does that a lot ,
because the , uh , we had a couple of good , real good wind storms ,
but , um , it was an older home ,
and they distribute them to the people ,
and , and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier . you know ,
well , see , i do n't ,
so i got my chicken mumblex and all my little net and everything ,
i 'm just a little bit too .
well , i 'd , i , now i have a problem with this , too .
and i do n't work out on saturday or sunday --
so , which i 've been doing .
i 'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask .
or , i do n't know whether this could be something that was done in school ,
um , our children are both grown
but that same house here , you 'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year ,
uh , out that way ,
of course that 's what i played ,
well , i never thought of that benefit , yeah .
and , uh , i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you 're , you 're more likely to get ,
well , our ho- , --
whatever i 'm doing , i watch that .
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort .
i 'm not .
and i 'm , and in full , uh , support of all of them .
and that 's really helped a lot ,
cause with two we have a problem ,
there was , uh , i understand there was a really good basketball b- , book called , uh , a season on the brink .
somewhere in that range .
um , um , well we 're living now in an area where we , we , we 're in the woods
so she stayed with her about , roughly two years ,
and her mother ,
but we 've been there when mumblex whose gone up there .
so , on next night , i spread the newspaper in the bathroom
we 've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them .
but , you know , we worked something out , because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long .
but i , i 've , i 've become very cynical --
so what you do is , you strip off , oh , four , five , six little rolls , coils , of line into your hand .
i 'm afraid to get him out .
and so , i know they did n't pick up these curse words from me .
so i can go out and go , uh , deep sea fishing .
and that 's supposed to be wonderful .
and that dropped off about the time i hit puberty , i guess ,
i was scared to start taking on payments because the buick was long since paid for .
i 've heard that ,
and , and so , uh , you know , so it 's , you can always count on her to watch something like that .
because we offer it in a very low , you know , quantity .
and then , all the sudden , it disappeared , you know .
i mumblex gave out my work number --
so , i 've done that once
getting out of that was a used car .
but most of the time it 's they get into the wrong crowd first ,
now everything else like the tra- , uh , paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers
i did n't think that ,
and , you know , he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that .
but now i go back there
i watch just about anything ,
-- and it does n't become fun anymore .
for me , it 's much easier just the stationary bike ,
and of course uh , of battery or assault or , that is not a capital crime see .
and , uh --
-- and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp --
he could , he could of hit something else .
it was one thing
and it 's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over --
so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house .
and what they were pleading was , um , they were pleading insanity .
oh , i have n't watched that very much ,
and i realize they 're still saying , well here you 're encouraging us to get rid of saddam hussein ,
but they 're seventy-five and , and seventy-two .
and it seems like every time i 'm short of cash , i just go get , get it from visa .
and ,
you know the , the other thought that i had , uh ,
and they ca n't imagine why we would want to have children .
and he , he is real fun to listen to .
i just happen to plan one out for saturday
i , i , i pretty much am
and , uh , an part of the , the movie is where he 's trying to clean this dog up
though she 's not , uh , she does n't have to receive constant medical attention , she , because of arthritis , she 's just unable to get out of bed .
and i am looking forward to that too .
and , uh , i think the bulls won by two .
my my dog , last german shepherd , it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too .
and you lose a lot of that .
so , a little different .
and i have n't figured how to get that soft ,
well m- , my wife , was sort of in the same situation ,
well i like seventies --
i have friends that live in the other , the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town
i did n't see ,
my wife when she talked about the middle east
i mean they fine the industries ,
but again , it 's just like the sun scorch .
he does ,
and then we got that cafeteria plan ,
and on the cover of time magazine , there is a girl , she is in boston ?
and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon
and i keep telling my husband that ,
my sister lives in plano .
and that 's , uh , what we put back on there , was a latex paint .
uh , i graduated in eighty-six .
and they 're , you know , they 're in like mumblex and scouts and stuff like that , you know ,
well i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions ,
i mean really little .
in the summertime they have musicals there
it was n't really conversation ,
that was one that , that stayed with me --
i know .
well , we 're working on it .
but i never , i never heard results or anything like that ,
but sometimes mumblex my husband , my husband says usually , i work on the computer all day at work ,
hell , i 'd love to cut ours in half ,
anyway , that 's about where i stand .
he said , you know the plot line and the characters , uh , you know are n't real big
i detest going to houston because it 's such a ,
so , our time is scarce .
oh , i loved it .
but when you get into a , a lot of the more complex weapons , i would say yes
now , you know , people get fired ,
well , i only know ,
it 's really good .
i mean i 've never been to italy , okay ,
and t v in argentina 's really bad .
w- , we really , we do n't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of t v --
uh , and they have those strateg- , strategically placed around the city .
so i really do spend probably more time with him than , than most , you know .
here , you know , the real problems are the gangs .
everyone i 've ever known from the midwest can do everything with their hands .
and she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing .
they , uh , well , the one of them 's a teenager that lives next door
-- and , uh , in the small town we do n't ,
i agree ,
well , in washington state , if you 're a habitual sexual offender , they just do n't let you out .
and i saw that , it did n't stop crime in that state .
he ran her out , was running to hi , in a wheelchair to hide her ,
you saw eighty thousand dollar cars ,
and now everybody , uh , has v c r -s and two or three v c r -s --
i just went to school
so , if it mows , gets mowed , i do it normally .
i never had time for , you know , to sew myself a new dress or anything like that
i --
oh , well , knox is just over the hill here .
i , i know of some people who did , uh ,
and they 're part of the ch- , uh , plano children 's civics , civic chorus .
-- and , uh , uh , i 'm a real big baseball fan
and i did my first bike rally this saturday .
but she works --
well if you could call it a benefit that c m u , i mean i- ,
and it cuts off the , uh , you know excess seam allowance .
and it was so , you know , pick your own , uh , blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast .
and , uh , they do not have any kids ,
in fact , when we first got married , we would try to take these trips to minnesota to see his family --
and the food just comes out ,
haiti .
my kids are twenty and sixteen ,
well i b m does n't fire anybody .
it cost me over five hundred dollars .
the cheese fondue i make ,
and they were told that , uh , he would probably serve three ,
-- because it would be really nice to be able to have , you know , someone that could watch my daughter at work .
and , of course , i 'm a baby of the old school --
uh , i 've got some .
and so i , i really do n't want to , want to , uh , you know , back off on it .
but , um , i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i thought school ,
they wound up paying him , uh ,
uh , i 've got three children at home . two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old ,
and then , he did it
there i could barely make a couple of miles .
but , you know when i hear about things like , you know , what they 've , what they 've been reporting about in milwaukee , you know i , i , to me i do n't see any way of rehabilitating the guy .
and it , it is fun for me to do that .
that 's why i like some diversity the idea that , i , we have time which , which we take from time to time
somebody will say , oh did you hear about this that happened last week
and so i did , like i say , tend to go back to albums and --
and so he has a big landing area that 's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts --
sometimes , when everybody 's gone to bed , my kids are in bed and my husband in bed ,
it 's getting nice .
but he was n't the one that decided iraq needed to get out of kuwait .
i do n't know all of them
and he rewired the house
he does n't know how many years --
well , we did n't have any , uh , avid , uh , activities like that ,
and , uh , then my eighty-six was a touring sedan .
and it 'll convert every measurement on there --
-- we 'd go every weekend .
and then you hear the muted trumpet .
i would , i would have to drive six thirty five home
i do n't know what channel he found that on --
you just couldn- ,
just stir that in
well , now i changed for ethical reasons .
so it 's north to me .
um , like you said , anti-lock brakes and air bag ,
because i think he 'd like that one .
and it was , i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because i did n't know her --
given the choice of either sentencing to death , or sentencing to life , they 'll give them ninety years in prison or something , and then turn around in thirty years , that , you know ,
i do a toe lift and squats --
i 'm going to stick with the cassettes and , and , uh , you know , until , until they ,
i had gourmet --
-- it , it brings out such a , so much different things in , uh --
i , i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to .
and i do n't know whether it 's by state or whether there 's been some --
by the same token we had , um , uh , some people who wanted t- , had vacations planned
i live in richardson ,
i do n't , i do n't scrub them or anything ,
we always put ten percent back ,
-- uh , we 've , uh , we 've usually , we often save those and ventured out on , from there , uh , just for something that had a high rating .
and , and so they were so upset from robbing this guy , you know , trying to do this holdup that did n't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started , you know , shooting people .
and say , well , i 'm going to buy this when it 's good and on sale
plus it , uh , has , you know , from an economic point of view it has increased our debt --
i was working on a masters degree
but i mean , it , i think it 's just kind of the north american situation mumblex .
so i do n't have any children .
and they devastate the trees
and i --
but , um , we 're just so happy to see green .
the more smoke is produced , you know ,
i think that 's , uh , just having a good time .
well , i 've been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the summer and getting them burnt up ,
so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store , which is new to me , you know ,
uh , and i find ways to , to turn some of that back to , to others .
well , we are ,
uh , and because the cost of living around here is so high ,
and , uh , that makes it a lot more enjoyable .
and , uh , but grew up in , uh , iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden --
well , today on c n n they were talking about something like this about , uh , learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that 's going on which is kind of what we 're doing , helping them get a data base for words .
we watch a lot of movies that we 've got on v c , on tapes ,
and ,
i do n't really remember , for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee .
they 're not going to change that to meters .
and then , uh , my morning paper . i can hardly wait for it to come .
i like ,
and --
we , we pull mostly evenings .
and it 's the loopers that form the , the edge , you know that edge finish .
i i mumblex woman always says , my husband always goes three that , i guess .
-- and , uh , took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing ,
but out on the line , they 've got people working some --
well , my dad , all he , all he wanted to do was get money for us ,
and she had , before it actually got big , she sent me this book saying , you might like this ,
i do n't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they 're citizens ,
and , of course , they tend to cover the county ,
yeah , i mean , i , i really , i would like to , uh , to do at some point , um ,
i , i listened
but here , let me put that in a paper cup for you .
so i 've seen a wide range of both , you know , nonsalary type benefits and other stuff , you know , like health care that 's either fully or partially paid
he 's probably about forty years old now ,
they take out for the , for the finances --
uh , i graduated in nineteen eighty-seven .
ice and rain and everything .
we have , um ,
this whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five .
i , i should imagine that , that would be to keep it at a level , those levels , i guess , that , that were originally appropriated w , was when the soviet threat , i guess , was perceived as being a greater one .
-- but , when we first moved to coppell , it 's what , six years ago , we did n't even have a grocery store --
now , the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny .
i won , always wonder when you have little things like that happen , why , even here at t i , why we do n't inspect , i 'm in facilities , why we do n't inspect areas and , and guarantee it so to speak . uh ,
but , anyway . well , i 'm ,
and that 's pretty much the norm for me .
you know . so ,
i , i , uh , i just do n't like them .
but , uh , i know we had a problem down here with , uh , oil , people taking oil out of their cars --
and i , uh , i , i have not found one yet that i would rather live in .
you only have to take three days of vacation
back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country , uh , primitive things , the little , the little pigs and the jeez , and the --
and they would , uh , they also edged ,
so we just , you know , we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that .
she worked part-time when my oldest was , was little
because you almost have to strip the whole thing ,
that 's why i say , it 's , it 's a tough question what would you do ,
we are talking about starting camping again in the fall .
i do n't , i do n't ,
they were lost , you know , when they were little ,
i was ,
well , we used to ,
because , you know , i 've talked to many people
he was , he 's of course , uh , i guess he 's trained in this , uh , martial arts of some sort ,
and then i went and looked and , to see what my visa was
and so they just have a , you know , a day picnic ,
and , uh , it was called the dells ,
and , uh , i had sandy loam hauled in .
but , uh , to the best of my ability , i 'd like to do it until it gets impossible .
do you have , you said you had two cats ,
but i stopped doing that a long time ago ,
i think they all that- , thought , well , we have a live one . she 'll subscribe .
and i never worried about saving money because we just , we 're in the savings plan at work
there 's nobody again .
and i ,
and , uh , you know , i , i know that in , mumblex i just know that i 'm going to get blown away with some , some piece of nonsense .
but they do have one in texas .
it was something like that , although , we sort of , when we got through i wished we had n't done it
uh , right here in colorado springs where i live --
and so --
i , i guess there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to . uh , be it through different organizations , march of dimes type , uh , telethons or , or bicycle rides or whatever , how they fund whatever , uh , illness they wish .
i think i , um , have read recently that , uh , the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps .
but i use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents .
but on the other hand it 's , it 's fairly impressive to watch them , you know , walk into the room with gallows .
and then it ,
because they , a lot of times they dial sequentially .
and so i can see from the company 's standpoint that there , uh ,
and , you know , their reg- , their regulation that 's placed on them is , i mean , it 's better than it used to be
i went to school there at abilene christian
and we were there in the fall before the snows , you know , started
i 've got some friends that are lawyers
um , i like things like i just mentioned ,
it 's , um , a couple of blocks west .
well , the first thing we always plant is tomatoes --
i was n't even looking for a car when i bought this car .
well , i think , i think his sleep book is my favorite .
i took lessons for thirteen years ,
i guess i 'm thinking of the easy thing to do --
and i said , well , yeah , you know ,
i think one of my favorite then is from the guy stephen , is it brochco , who does like l a law --
when i drive down --
but not on a , on the regular basis .
uh , the ammunition is probably so old i 'm afraid to use it .
well , i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers , partly because i find it more soothing .
so if you 're renting a house or doing anything else , you 're not actually contributing to the education of your children .
we live in the dallas area , richardson .
and i get the milk lukewarm
so i got a four runner .
like at work , we 'd have a t v or whatever .
and , i 'm --
and , and , you know , this is one of those things ,
and so , uh , i enjoy watching some of the t v highlights and also , uh , some of the news periodicals , uh , weekly magazines ,
i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with
i 'm , well , we 're starting out a new one ,
i , i know the concept of counties in texas is quite a bit different than it is here in maryland , uh ,
i thought i heard this morning that in san antonio it was in the nineties yesterday .
you know , i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell
we used to do it at home when i was a kid ,
and their veal dishes have been good .
they 're like dolls ,
it 's about an inch and a half long
i 'm only up here for school .
you do n't want the government to spend your money .
most of the guys were all in one class
or maybe it 's only half hour .
i have n't .
and we had thought before maybe a lot older we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it ,
uh , they were bragging about it ,
for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool .
and by the time everything is settled in ,
so they have this think tank .
i , uh , i , i like the way it is .
i , i do n't really have the time to read the whole thing ,
it is commercialized .
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based on the , uh , person who is accused .
and four years after that i got another master 's degree .
but , you know , there goes my savings .
so , uh , you know , i did n't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college .
well , really it , uh , the letter just says , um ,
but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did
and if there 's a game on , he 's watching it .
he 's black
and , of course , it was beautiful and ,
and then we rented a car for two weeks
i try to limit what they watch .
we just kind of did what we wanted --
and they had ,
you know , one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b c ,
my parents go camping a lot ,
so , they just watched the water pour in on the carpet .
or you do tell them you 're not interested
and , um , it 's great ,
i did n't see that many of them .
-- and , uh , otherwise , of course my husband 's into the football --
and then , you know , people asking for , for money for everything , you know ,
they go upstairs and have their morning coffee .
and we had a vocational , uh , electronics in our high school .
i could , i could n't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing .
i work in , i 'm a , on the professional administrative and technical staff ,
and the fog never makes it that far .
everybody 's on their way to someplace --
we were at a soccer game saturday ,
uh . oh , it 's supposed to be a real scary one .
so it wo n't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home ,
and we just looked all over for it and could n't find it ,
i mean , it 's just almost surreal , in some places .
i mean , i was n't a great asset to them or anything .
and that takes about , really about , maybe about thirteen minutes , uh --
but , uh , he built us a house ,
it came out really dark .
now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back ,
i know that my late husband was simply indifferent .
appreciate it .
but mostly if it 's something major , um , you know , cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that , we just hire out to do that ,
the french were there .
it 's just , uh , it 's just so realistic . everything they do .
and my husband had a lot of heartburn with that .
and , um ,
it seems like most people like spaghetti .
well he is just , he is really active still politically .
and it 's right on the arm rest in the back --
i decided this past year that i was going to get out and start playing a lot more
um , well , let 's see . i just , i mean , i just like to go
including new vans ,
i know , i know nobody around here does , it ,
but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight .
you know , the breakfasts and ,
so , i , i do feel strongly about .
i mean , of course , i loved it , um ,
and it 's pretty cool .
makes sense .
it 's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a , on a p c .
it 's not really been too bad .
it 's the behavioral science part of communication ,
but they do n't have it anymore .
so , um , it 's strange , because it , it so , hit so close to home that um , my father 's an only child ,
i , i 'm , i 'm inveterate switcher .
so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so- ,
she 'll be two in july .
it drives me crazy .
and yeah ,
but we prefer g- ,
and they actually had a conference .
if you do n't want to , you know , uh , talk about it now and then --
but we have got more women in it now .
we try to spend saturdays together .
for example , uh , uh , well , uh , uh , train engineers .
and it 's amazing how much stuff j- , just the two of us generate ,
i have n't .
no we do n't have the mumblex ,
and it said , these are the color pastel shirts you may wear , or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and , hair just this way .
also , uh , uh , mexico , uh , we will loan the money in uh ,
and you know like he sent planes over to , to shoot the people down that were on the border with , uh , tha , that were on their way to turkey .
i 've , uh ,
it never snows down here ,
but um , there are some parts during that exercise that i think , i can not do another --
i think e d s has seven to , to eight years .
always right , right before the news is when i catch them .
and it really , it really added up .
so we got the kind we wanted
so hopefully this year he 'll have one .
so i 've been doing very little reading , except i , i did finally dip into a couple of biographies . um , all of sort of literary figures of this century .
turns out , you do n't , you do n't , you do n't really find bagels in israel .
and they are , um , of an advanced years ,
they , they drove up ,
i ca n't see all this little , uh , smoke buckets i call them ,
but ,
uh , his last name ends in a z , i know that .
but they also , uh , they also , uh , go to the different composers , or the different , i guess ,
he ca n't --
and i have gone back
i mean there 's no point in giving them any more money than we have to .
and i see it ,
and we found a preschool for him .
-- but the , the ice storms really are stressful on all the , the plants that we have around .
i 'm not certain that that was ,
now i have n't eaten there .
and she was excited about it
i let my wife take the checkbook ,
we do .
oh , i enjoyed it .
now , there are times when you 'd --
i , i was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year .
i too- , i drove it from here to memphis
in the beginning when he , uh , he was transferred to a , a larger plant
and it was really disgusting .
because they 're talking like it was an american built car .
i , i 'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time .
my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
we had , you know , had shotguns for , for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that .
it 's i t b s or , and , uh , just everything , everything .
um , we 're late twenties .
i 'd , i never was , you know , too , a whole lot of , a big fan , you know .
and he had enough money to , you know ,
i use to watch that
it 's a large city , ,
oh , but , you know , i 'm going to try .
and the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics .
so it 's ,
but i just , i worry about who 's driven them and what they 've been through and the warranties and things like that .
i 'm , i 'm just graduating col- , graduating from college .
uh , they do n't cover eyes though ,
well we 're in the metroplex here , you know ,
actually my house is kosher ,
and she 's been in the nursing home now for , oh , i would say about three months .
it was a cadillac .
i 'm writing it down .
though --
it is not , it is not fun .
it was wonderful
and , you know , a lot of that sort of thing .
and it seemed like there was , it was a good sized den with a lot panelling
i did n't go then .
actually the , the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh .
and some of the are the overseas programs . uh ,
but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time ,
and he said usually you 'll get approved anyway because they just want your money , they want your card .
they go , well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it
i got to counting the other day
and , um , she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy .
of course , garth brooks lives about , uh , you know ,
sometimes they 've had two on , you know , one on every hook .
i like , i like some of those things .
and --
well , especially with something where you have to f- , you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt .
and they brought it down to the shelters .
it 's pretty remarkable because growing up we 've always had a beautiful , lush green lawn ,
my husband is ,
and when you throw trash away , you throw it in my yard .
it , it ,
i have a good friend there .
so , we went to the , to the , the medical insurance that we have at , here at work ,
and stuff like that .
i mean , i would n't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it were n't for the fact that they do n't , they do n't go to any place .
and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny --
uh , we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have .
and then , um , you know , we really do n't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later --
so i stopped that after a year , because it was difficult --
and , uh , i do n't know what they do for those people .
and she 's good at it .
we do the same thing .
there 's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars .
um , you know , he would come home
but i , i would n't want to go out and buy it like , you know , the hard back copy of it .
how to carry --
we want to next time pay cash for our car , too .
i ,
um , actually i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse , um , and flat shoes .
well , i usually like it about sweater weather ,
so i just finally took him out . plus financial reasons .
see now , that is where i want to go .
i just do n't like squash .
i 've done it in a shelter .
and --
and we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it .
they do n't have oil or anything ,
we just do n't , uh , go there --
um , i guess we 're going to talk , describe , uh , job benefits ,
-- and since then , uh , we 've made it , um ,
the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf .
it was brand new ,
and so we sort of did n't , did n't continue it ,
but they want any clean and dry plastic bag
and i love the water aerobics .
i , i learned that because , uh , a friend of mine ,
anyway , but i asked ,
i really enjoy that because it 's kind of a , a getaway type thing .
but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things ,
well , talk about working with big amounts of pie crust , and having it be tough .
i mean , kroger does a couple things .
but we just did n't get out .
and she 's so easy going and so sociable ,
uh , maybe after two or three or , y- , years old .
so i mean aerobics is something i 'd hate to give up .
you ca n't see any prisoners
but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is , quite a bit .
my car is really old , too ,
uh , it is in australia , for example .
and it 's actually very inexpensive ,
and then they all come out .
to water it
i ca n't think ever her name either .
and --
i , i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem .
-- it 's wonderful , uh ,
and since it 's inception , uh , they 've , the price has gone up per stu- , the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty-three percent .
so we 've had a lot of stuff , you know , friends and , and things to do with music that constant ,
i would go faithfully ,
i , you , you think about , you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient ,
and now i 'm a college educated builder mumblex .
but there 's kind of like a little , a little thing sticking out , uh , in the lake michigan ,
it took me a long time , they 're talking about the viaducts .
i 'm , i 'm kyle hunt ,
it seemed like it did ,
we live in the saginaw area .
so i like to get out by a lake --
it 's ours up here .
and they are , like i say right on the beach .
um i was mostly an a -s fan , you know .
but , um ,
and what happened was her husband was , uh , involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight
a , now my grandfather was going to pay if i went to , uh , what 's now u t arlington ,
so , trying to work myself out of a job .
so we did n't have a problem with that .
pretty much .
we 'd , i 've done one ,
but they 've really never used it .
i think , um , people ,
we would just lie them in there
i 've , i 've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week
i do n't have cable .
we had a lovely little house over there ,
i love to watch cooking shows .
our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me ,
i mean i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years .
what was i thinking .
but they 'll just , you know ,
oh , scientific american comes to our house , too , i forgot ,
um , i , um , i 'm making , some , uh ,
well i did hear the end of the prompt this time .
it 's fairly easy and fast .
and i 've had to work when i was designing packages for people ,
and then after the movie 's over , i remember it so terribly well --
would too .
-- so i 'm unable to , to , really take care of a pet
and mumblex you know , it ran fine .
uh , basically , they 're just , uh , having various recycling , uh , bins , uh , located for , uh , trash pickup .
oh , i , uh , like sports type things too .
we ca n't , at least in this area , you know , they do n't have any room to put anybody
so , it 's , it 's very authentic
i , i lucked out with really good people both times
you , it 's , it 's hard sometimes at work because , you know , people say , oh , we 're taking a cruise ,
-- and , you know , times are rough now ,
i felt safe that the kids were n't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them , you know , because --
there 's one very close to where my parents are
because i do n't like credit cards for one thing , you know ,
and i asked him , uh , what are you doing with that ?
as contract person we have to do random drug testing , too .
bermuda seems to be pretty ,
just getting out in the front , and just being outside is good for them
well i 'm originally from , uh , ohio , cincinnati ,
but , uh , there 's a t v show where the man is the one raising the kids ,
i taught early childhood --
the m , barometric pressure drops during a tornado ,
all right i said they have the choice
oh , have a ball with them .
and the light would come on
i 'm not sure where all my pins came from ,
it 's a nice area out there .
funny thing is the news , the national news how they covered it . uh ,
i was ju- , started to think about all the big , you know , data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports --
he was just so bad off , you know --
and , so they do n't have a disk drive .
i guess on a one , a scale of one of ten i 'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns
and , uh , so , i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like thumper that , boy , i could just go out and get all kinds of game .
and we can put full size cards in there .
kind of like big do- , big dogs
we just like it real well
and i had wool suits and wool skirts
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that 's on the bottom and put the , your new letter on the top ,
and now it 's like twelve .
you know , a nice car , american made
but it 's a bridge over top of roadway .
you have to cook very little to go with it , just some rice and some salad
i , i , i had seen it before christmas ,
but when he wants to be , uh , he 's really affectionate .
you have to do a whole lot of sit ups
it was ,
and , uh , we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato --
they 're , they 're realizing that more of the , the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs , getting away from the city
and , uh , that 's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back .
and --
it 's only about a block and a half long ,
and , uh , when i seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else , it 's just , i can imagine how emotional it must be . and , and , you know , multiplied by the fact that you do n't really trust the person or you 're uncomfortable with the situation mumblex , as far as child care , um ,
it must just ,
he is oldest
but we 've never really , uh , did any diving or anything .
if i get busy i do n't get a chance to pick it up , like this week i noticed several copies have been un- , have n't been touched
i 'm , we only get the paper on the weekends
i was ,
-- so sometimes i 'll do that overnight , and then put the topping on the next day ,
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells , and then build up to your , uh , twenty-five pound dumbbells --
you know , we lived in , uh , minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas ,
all four of ours are house cats .
and , uh , he chased after a , after a skunk and got sprayed --
but on the other hand , it 's clean and kind of suburban --
some of them i already knew about ,
i like the , um , sixteen candles , or sixteenth birthday or ,
i was wondering about that .
and they , they just been real , uh ,
oh . i remember though , like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now .
and he has like little ani- , stuffed animals with them and --
considering i , i work for it a living ,
there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results .
but i did run a child care facility for a while .
they are so expensive .
and at that point that was sort of the limit --
where you 're getting into the delicate work .
i definitely agree with parents .
and you go , oh , my gosh where did it all go .
it was good .
so , now they 're a year older ,
if you live in dallas county you have to have your , have to have it checked
and you slept on the train at night .
i have always called them ,
i , i can understand the public 's alarm to it ,
and then our son , he had to get on the bus ,
i told this woman that my hobby was gardening ,
i live in vermont ,
like i say , maybe one of these days i 'll get a job because i am looking still for a part-time job , you know , since my company went bankrupt
and the loading of it --
well , see that 's something i want to see ,
it started raining and got real cold .
and he did fine ,
but you still have to be realistic , as well , i think .
i was , i was impressed by them .
and throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve .
you know , a , a navy blue or a ,
i had the chance to hear tracy rowlett speak to a group
she told me some of the things you can do ,
it may be that i picked up something at the store ,
but i wonder --
even a , your social security number , you know , they ,
this is the first really large company i 've worked for . i 've
that 's about --
and so , you know , they do that
i know it 's going to be on , on the , on c b s tuesday night
and , of course i like the people magazine because it 's gossipy --
that is crime where they videoed .
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances ,
it 's not , not to me personally ,
and then they come back in ,
and you had to do something ,
his , his attitude is i think a little bit ,
the elected people .
one of the areas down there close to galveston is ,
and then before that one , i saw , um , oh , naked gun two and a half .
that is part ,
and , uh , it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little .
but i have n't planted anything yet
i know .
i 've , well , i 've been home with a , um ,
i 'm sympathetic certainly with that , that , that they want to come over here
and i did n't , i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area ?
and it 's not too bad to get it off once it 's dried even .
i have bible storybooks --
i graduated from texas tech ,
and there 's , you know , there 's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it 's an invasion of privacy ,
the orthopedist called it a , uh , basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you , and it snapped .
mostly i just , love walking in the mountains , driving in the mountains .
he 's being called a consultant ,
and , um , now i have got her in a montessori school .
i 'm a , i 'm a scoutmaster
and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house was n't big enough , so they bo- , bought a new , or built a new one --
i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas .
oh , just since last summer .
he got hurt at o u ,
she has the , the color and the black to- , tongue of a chow ,
i do n't .
it 's not new ,
i tape it and then watch it when it 's convenient
i did n't have a car in college .
um , i 'm home schooling my kindergartner this year .
i ca n't remember what food it was
we , uh , have n't had that much , you know , problem with things that we have bought .
angie .
and occasionally i 'll watch them on channel eleven ,
there really is n't .
but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious ,
-- and then they have about six miles from here is called , a little city called wesley ,
and they had a lot of games
so i decided i 'm going to paint .
we were just , when , when the topic came up , we , i was asking my husband right quick , what 's the last movies we saw .
and then my sister takes care of her .
he put new wiring in ,
i had , i had a granddaughter .
so if you can imagine how i even go- , ,
college freshman , i , college coed .
you know , we 've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here --
and --
-- and i just said to this kid ,
and we have a belt line alo- , around raleigh where we 're trying to divert traffic .
and , and hal and i were in bed
i worked at t i for a little while .
i used to do that quite a bit myself .
-- and they should pay through next month ,
i , i ca n't get out to dance all the time
they are booked up .
it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes ,
i could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what i think we ought to do about it .
and i have n't had much experience with nursing homes .
and even , um , uh , police corps which started , you know , finding other breeds to use because this thing , this , this thing known as a german shepherd here , its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible .
well , uh , i , right now i 'm in sort of a weird situation .
and one of the things that i , i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation --
you know , so many of them now have the ribbons where , i 'm not sure how they do it ,
but his dad 's at home --
well , i enjoy playing with my cats .
i do n't know how long i 'm ,
so . i know ,
i generally would p , uh , prefer to listen to , uh , well , i listen to k c b i a lot
i have four cats .
the only thing you 've got to watch is when that creek comes up .
i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it .
and , and she expected all of her kids to do that too ,
and i do fabric painting .
i did n't .
and if you look outside , you would like to go out and mow your lawn ,
uh , much better .
like what makes a firefly light ,
as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought .
i do n't know the value of that , because i saw plenty of jokes and , and , um , oh , editorial cartoons about all the retired generals ,
he said , no they 're not .
i never got around to reading it
and i , i just happen to work at a waco station , because you know .
the times i 've been out deer hunting , i , i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa .
uh , marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes , because of some of the stupid stuff he does ,
and i hated him then .
well , right now i 'm just a homemaker ,
-- but our children got a very good education there --
and you think to yourself , was it that bad back then ?
it 's , uh , not that expensive .
well , the , the , the major cause it seems up here is exc- ,
you know , a kit .
and you know , i 've never bought butter --
we , uh , you know , i think they 're a lot of company ,
uh , she learned to drive i think when i was , um , a teenager ,
and that involves both canadian ,
and in that case then i 'll be , i 'll be at home when my children are at home ,
so i think if i had a big home and a big lawn i 'd , i do n't believe i would enjoy it .
and i 'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision .
i 've always kind of enjoyed it .
-- and she is in band .
we would just run and jump over the couches .
fact , he 's back in jail now .
well , the way , it seems the way it 's been working here 's ,
-- and that scares me .
i 'm not even really sure at this point in time , you know , what , what programs are out there .
and i worry about that .
she does n't live within her professional income , you know .
well , i mean , there 's so many places here , you know ,
i would , i 'd have to go out to the country to jog .
i 'm trying to think the last actual book i read that was n't ,
and one of the , one of the things that really gets to me , uh , about the mexicans is that , um , once they have children over here , their children are american citizens then .
but , uh , i do n't know if i 'd want one of those now .
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that , like a kid 's place area .
well , see that was one of the things s- , the , the question i think is ,
a shrimp it 's a shrimp dish ,
and i just do n't like that .
mumblex new houses that i 've seen .
well , i worked for the government ,
well , we really want to have a family .
i mean , i might not have that much ,
-- and he got a demo .
-- i mean , as a matter of fact , that 's what we 're doing tonight .
i know you got , uh , certain spring lever that you got to have or some , uh --
and they were arguing back and forth
uh , everybody has to contribute
during the winter time i think they , they move south or something --
um , well , we go out and fly kites
uh , so what you 've got is a registered pet .
well , i 'll tell you , the only reason i bought the , uh , i subscribe to the journal is because of ,
but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a , like a , a clothes hamper kind of thing that , you know , you lay your string in , then you put your papers in there --
otherwise , um , i like to read children 's books , and things like that .
i do n't , i do n't , i like to read the paper
so then we , when we all graduated from hi , college , from high school ,
and , uh , it 's a three bedroom two bath ,
never been in new york .
but we were n't taking advantage of them because we did n't have the time to .
they , they do n't really want them around
well , let 's see , well , we assume i was an adult twenty years ago , . um ,
i 'm the , you know , i 'm the opposing teams best player , so , so to speak ,
you had to go chase her down .
and he knew that .
but i do n't know what it 's about .
oh , well , tuesday nights i guess , we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like .
but we 've never got to talk to another person ,
they do n't , they do n't try to , uh --
uh , i do not think i would either .
that 's the only time i ever spent with my mother ,
it was about two years ago for ,
you know , the , the little joke about , will the last person leaving michigan just turn out the light .
and , uh , th- , it certainly had that .
i guess there 's some places where you can recycle aluminum
it was a christmas tree that had , uh , a little trinket for each day ,
and it l- , it held for about four to six months .
and a poorly tuned car can emit something ,
used to be we , we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up .
i 'm the same way .
-- this was everybody .
so it was n't that specialized .
and we used that to go camping .
but it 's , you know , it 's a problem that 's , that 's moving south from , from the new england area .
and he 's like a little brother to me .
she 's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do , you know , with , with the family because she was m , the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children .
and i never read until a few years ago
we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden
and i was the only jew both nights .
i do not know what the world is or is not . uh ,
and she said i should know something by tomorrow , which was friday ,
now i carry one .
and i hope to make twenty-five which
and i think golly moses , you just do your part .
and , uh , it 's been in two , maybe three times .
she married
i know that costa rica , they do n't allow anybody to come that , uh , to come any , uh , what do you call , what do you call immigrants ?
but it 's , it is very nice .
i mean , i 'm sure i 'm going to be seeing it because in a week to amarillo where my sister lives , and she 's got two boys that i took to see the first one .
and we 're just now getting on board to recycling --
and , and that 's kind of the plan i have
the second one --
and there was n't , you know .
-- and i went to , uh , the city of rochester school district --
but it 's not as bad as i thought it would be ,
sometimes , you really want to say that ,
and like in pennsylvania for babies , that 's what i work with , there has to be a one to four ratio at the most .
they said they 've got the white beaches and the sand ,
but we used to go to tyler state park and , uh , daingerfield
and you got a great dinner .
well , that 's us too --
i 'm just taking the other side so we 'll have a discussion here .
i do turn that on .
we really need some ,
the ghost of shoeless joe was the name of the book .
and i had one that was born in december ,
so , uh , you know --
well , mumblex , see i 'm going to school right now ,
my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school , took them to an elderly home ,
and i do n't realize , really , that 's really the only time i ever watch t v , is when i 'm on the bike .
see , i grew up in nebraska --
it has a radical fringe to it that , uh , i 've sort of backed away from .
and , and they say , oh , we , we know you .
so i really did .
but if you have to get up and get out in it , i do n't like it either .
i mean , the parts cost me , oh , roughly a hundred dollars .
-- and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my daughter up ,
uh , we have a eighteen year old , seventeen year old , and a seven year old .
they might have five hundred troubled youths .
uh , it 's just a piece of material that has , uh , that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it --
but i did n't have to worry about all that , because they were n't under warranty .
and the stars were just five feet above you .
i , maybe i misunderstood what they meant .
and , uh , i liked those two movies of his a lot .
so , mine 's a ford .
uh , it does n't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or , you know , carry it to wherever you want to carry it really , uh ,
and , uh , i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home .
my husband gets paid once a month --
and , i did n't realize that they ha , were going to reach out to people from ,
and , uh , tina enjoys , uh , the other lady ,
but we did , we really truly did pay a fortune .
and i think that , um , that 's fine , i would like to see more time spent on other things .
and now i , lik- , like a said , i 've read a lot of self , self help books .
i do n't watch much t v ,
i was an interesting , in that i think that he gave the american people some , uh , uh , a sense of the fact that , that , uh , wars are really run by politicians .
i , i 'm , i 'm , of course , i 'm a t i -er ,
we have the duty to pay taxes .
we look at our , talk to our realtor
well , i know richardson school district has a , has a wonderful program in the remedial reading , um , where , you know ,
and when her , her family comes to her and says , fix this , you know ,
i like the , uh ,
that does n't do a lot for them .
i work for texas instruments --
i do n't know .
well , most , most , most of the time when you see bus , uh , you know , the busses with the diesel --
see , i 'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now
but my husband likes to watch , um , old movies , especially war movies , or , or , uh , sports , which i 'm not ,
so i know i 'd be happy with a , a reasonable , uh , four door .
and i , i , and i 'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car .
i always thought i would ,
i 'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies .
he calls it the new building .
well , i myself would n't want to be on the jury like that .
and i kind of set that aside --
but i do n't know if we 'll get it or not .
and this is , of course , x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens
i like swimming .
we really enjoy that too .
and then , uh , night stand ,
i , i love it ,
but during the day , you know , it 's all devoted to our kids
that 's something that , that i guess i have not much of an image of other than , than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a , in a carefree sense , i guess .
i 've heard it 's very controversial though .
and see , especially in the tent --
so something 's happened here ,
-- and we have two p c -s here w- , at home .
so , i guess news is just part of that rat race for me .
and , uh , uh , i have a program which allows me to access a , uh , weather data bank
in fact i 'm doing that right now with their afternoons , when they get home before i do . you know ,
anything can go on in california .
all these places that i 've never been .
i had a , uh , dodge pickup several years ago ,
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here
there was cartoon in cosmo about a year or two ago
and we travel a lot
i have n't seen it ,
my husband , on the other hand , was not very close to his family .
and , you know , we 're right on target , you know ,
mumblex well we was , uh , teasing , about , you know , splitting our house down the middle .
-- and , you know , they talk about death ,
and we did n't do a whole lot better .
we just have n't had the time to go to the movies lately ,
i mean , that 's why they recycle .
and there are shows that i really put my foot down on .
and he does , uh , he has a talk show on the , k l i f .
uh , we live in a mobile home
and i do n't know if there 's a deposit on those or not .
they keep on dying
uh , baltimore is trying to get a team ,
we have a financial , uh , analyst , a finance administrator , i guess , that , that , uh ,
but i do like them .
and it reduces some of the length of the benefits , and , uh , and i do n't know besides that .
and we really enjoy that .
but generally , you know , i can , i can get in and get a program , you know .
but if i , uh , if i take the bus , it requires several transfers
that 's what we have .
and it , it 's nice , i mean , you know , it 's okay an .
i 'm thankful for that ,
but now it 's mainly evenings .
and they were dumping the gatorade bucket and everything .
i 've , uh , i 'm not working right at the moment
so we just said , hey , let 's stop
but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff .
everybody will say , oh , this is real simple ,
-- you know , prone type things , where you 're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing ,
oh , i like far out facts or whatever .
and ,
it 's definitely not one of the , the smaller ones ,
they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends , cause they all grew up in new york city ,
but it , it 's f slash x .
they have breeders .
a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations .
but then she just started substituting .
i mean it 's more money that i make in a year ,
so that 's why i concentrate on weekly magazines .
between the channels there was , uh , the casualties , the amount of missiles launched were different
ninety-two .
because i , i had lived in the ,
so that --
they 're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation .
being a , being the bachelor here that i am , i , i do n't think i 'd , i 'd be a- , b- ,
it 's , it 's a very nasty thing .
i have a brother in minnesota that used to live in wisconsin .
i 'd like to be able to do more .
and one of them , they ,
it was a cedar shake house ,
while i was finding people , i , uh , i could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it ,
well , basically , yeah
but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children , um , i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching ,
my mother said ten minutes
and , uh , one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was , you know ,
i mean might as well not even heat and cool it .
i mean , there 's that , that old saying those who can do it and those who ca n't teach ,
and , of course , i 'm not perfectly happy about not having a job .
and that 's got me very , you know , highly concerned that , uh , that 's going to be quite a while before we can , uh ,
i thought that was pretty strange .
when you have fish au gratin ,
but i have similar machines at home .
for me it 's kind of hard ,
and you can stack them up and , and leave them out and put things in them , even .
i do it every day on a regular basis .
i mean , i got probably the biggest ,
-- and see we 've yet to keep anyone up over --
and it 's just ten children at a time .
it was a very close game , and hard fought game .
and it 's a wildlife ,
they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they 're raised .
but others , eh , i really do have to work at them .
and --
but , i like to look at the flowers .
and there was dog dirt in it --
it is wide open , uh , and flat --
but when i went more rural , you know , that , it really changed .
uh , his f- , last appeal was , was denied two days before his sentence was up .
and so i start answering
i want something i can drive too , you know ,
well , my husband --
we , we usually collect a , you know , collect a quite a bit
and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car .
it 's kind of like what ours is .
i do n't want to have to mess with it .
so , i 've heard him talk about that forever .
we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump
oh , it was ,
we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere .
oh , probably be another twelve years .
i u , i used to take mccall 's and good housekeeping and , uh , several magazines like that a few years ago at , at , at home .
but , but there again i , i do not know if the , the jury system itself , uh , comes in to play there .
and , uh , i know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about , uh , her situation .
that they said is excellent is the i 'll fly away and brooklyn bridge .
we lease .
if , when i 'm in the nineties i 'm feeling good .
i do n't know what the answer is .
you know , could n't believe ,
i enjoyed it .
and , uh , the reason i , i quite was because of , uh , not because i did n't like it ,
but see i do crafts too ,
well , in my family , let 's see , last october was the forty fifth annual --
but , uh --
and because the parking brake had n't been used in so many years , the piston froze up .
our budgeting plan includes me getting a job .
you , you , you talked about having the summers off
-- so i do n't read the new ones ,
so we 're kind of waiting to , like , uh , now , you know ,
there they tell me they , they ,
so , cause this was the first , first real job after getting my degree .
he will be able to ,
one of my first cars was a fifty-six buick .
you know , there is incredible cover --
and the water in medina lake and that area was really going down , that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing
this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap ,
i like volleyball .
and they said that in canada , there were as many heart , uh , trauma centers as there is in san francisco .
and they let her bring her , her little daughter in for free .
and they pay cash for everything they buy .
and i 'm a half hour ,
and i guess i like a variety of , a variety of restaurants .
i mean , they have all kinds of nice write ups about it --
oh , but you were just talking about ,
it was just gorgeous . i mean just gorgeous .
and , uh , k- , kind of the same situation .
well , it 's ninth , nine through twelve --
-- and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers ,
i , as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday , who said she has a new policy in her home
and then i have to bring it back .
we know what a job it 's going to be
but --
and i do quite a bit of business in washington .
it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country
-- and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea . because they , they make bundles of money off those things .
and , and we learned that , you know , um , some of the gardening skills we had were before ,
and then i get like green beans and mashed potatoes .
i 'm not saying that i do either
she knows what she 's doing ,
and her husband said she was n't pulling her own weight in the family --
i , i want to keep helping people out
we are going to go to , uh , destin , florida , which is a very nice beach area , if you are not familiar with it .
it 's in a can that 's that 's taller but not as big around .
and , uh , they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time .
robert de niro ,
so i try to do it every night ,
i pretty much question or what , what the u s -s motives were in , uh , in , in actually the original involvement .
you know , it 's just really hard .
unfortunately , some elderly have to go to or have , i guess it 's alzheimer 's or where --
you know they have , uh , women there going to s m u , going to , uh , southern methodist university and , and graduating in opera or something like that
and he did n't , he , the only thing he did n't like very well was the drumming .
and sometimes i wear a blazer with them ,
i , i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country .
i had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides .
we have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents
and it was , it had previously been unoccupied ,
i 'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved --
it was kind of fun .
but , uh , the problem is that so i 'm paying state tax even if i do n't live here .
and we try to stick to it .
-- and that is about it .
but i do n't have to worry about , you know , running them up too high , except at christmas .
and all of a sudden , i do n't know , it 's just , it 's eating me alive .
sometimes i think , um , it 's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries .
-- but as long as i was single and had to work , i was going to get a good job and do the best i could .
so i know how she feels about it .
so , i had n't seen that in a long time .
and the glass on the windows .
i 've , actually i am reading a couple of different books , uh ,
i work for a school system
and , uh , you just bring the covered dishes .
uh , we went through a process of , of , uh , home repairs on a , on a rental house we had ,
some states they pay , uh ,
and , uh , uh , the ice and snow just does n't , uh , hold any allure for me at all .
and , um , i was not real happy when , uh , when they , uh , left to go , go there of all places .
that 's where i see most of it .
it 's ranked so much better .
as a matter of fact , uh , what we 've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a , uh , a blue
i 'm not sure how old you are .
what the controls are .
um , i worked at t i for a while ,
and my son was two in january .
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes ,
and , uh , i ca n't really talk too much about the problems with , uh , public education in detail because the school system i went to was , uh , really superb even though it was a public school --
but , uh , all the same it is connected to my attitude ,
and he said , sure , you know ,
not my a lot ,
uh , i never thought about someone robbing those ,
uh , elementary and special ed .
and then some of them are done in , you know , purely metric .
and , uh , the van we 're sor- ,
oh , i like it better doing it .
and it was very different
you could n't do anything .
this one was only forty-five dollars .
now that 's inside again ,
and , uh , i know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it --
and i , i just do n't feel like cooking .
i , we , i believe in unions ,
uh , and i , i recycle aluminum , glass , uh , newspapers .
uh , i 'm of the age that could have gone , although i did n't
i 'll drool over them .
some of the things we do together as a family , we like to play games a lot ,
but i do it because i have to not because i want to .
i told him yo- , if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a backpack .
and i said i did n't know what that was
and they 've got their electrical hookups .
and , uh , so she 's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the u s government in that respect ,
i 've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around .
i do n't know where .
so i do love classical music
but it 's almost eight hundred kilometers , you know .
uh , as long as i do n't have a major disaster where i have to use it again , i can , i can do that .
and some of those and get fajitas ,
and so now he 's at texas women 's university .
instead of throwing out the window , they , they keep the bottle
i remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something
-- master charge .
i just know , i know several single mothers who absolutely ca n't afford it .
well if you get a chance ,
well , um , i 'm , i 'm originally from butler
uh , but i , uh ,
showing my age ,
and , uh , it was kind of like just about their ,
i really , uh , like him a lot . which is why , dances with wolves was the last movie we had seen --
and then maybe camp another night and drive home .
now i do n't know what the current texas laws are
and i recently read an article on just this , that said stress today is so much worse .
and , uh , then have christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things ,
t i had a place ,
and i ran over and picked up her report card ,
uh , i do take care of my youngest granddaughter , uh , most every saturday .
you know , i 've made like little swedish meatballs ,
and we do that ,
uh , i like historical , uh , books , time magazine , newspaper , how , how to do it type things , uh , uh .
and their friends are driving mercedes
still had to cut it and everything ,
um , and i was very very fortunate in that i did n't have to do that on a full-time basis .
and i did , uh , had my own garden
so , it 's not really total retirement .
i , i ,
and i love it .
um , it goes back to the things like drug screening
um , my father owns a restaurant .
i just do n't have time any more .
i 'm sure there 's a lot . but i agree with you , there 's a lot in business .
-- uh , it , it is our big dream .
and they said , oh , but we need more in the middle school because that 's when kids are , you know , at a tougher and rougher age and all that .
they 're supposed to be coming out with all these desert storm movies ,
that 's what i , one thing i like about t i is that they are n't overly strict about what you wear
and it 's a , and it 's a salesperson , at least you can chat or whatever and say , okay , now , we want to go ,
before we moved to ,
but when i think about where i 'd want to go , you know , this is still the best
course , she grew up catholic
but i think i know what it is .
and up here the water 's probably about forty degrees right now .
and i have n't gotten over that from the north .
i am wanting bl ,
and then i was going to make other things like potato skins .
i think the last i heard was it 's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars .
but , uh , my husband is not a conformist at all .
i admire ,
well , uh , texas is a big state
i can just dump them at the other end ,
the next car i buy is going to be sort of a sports car .
like i talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized ,
and i came up spittering and sputtering for air
i know .
it 's , it 's been a while now .
but , uh , they really were helpful , i know , to our house .
and i do n't , do n't see it in them yet ,
well , and then , too , now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly . my water bill was high .
i spent one winter in north dakota ,
i 've never had random drug testing .
i do n't know how they 're going to do it .
and the doctor said , you did n't do anything .
they did n't , they only did it for , i think , two years .
the last few years just in , through december and january it , it really is foggy and , and seems to just , um ,
and that 's it , you know .
and that sort of thing ,
but , and , i do n't know , the problem is now ,
well , actually , it , if you , if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside , pretty much the end of may ,
and your defense attorney presents their evidence
i do .
all the brothers and sisters got together
i 've just used wordperfect and lotus and , the most .
and this was back in the eighties .
well , i used to .
well , we were from north , um , carolina ,
i would leave totally exhausted .
now , a ,
well , my cou- , uh , husband and , and his uncle especially , uh , grew up camping together ,
i know .
i mean , i 've , i 've probably heard him ,
-- i know it affected me when i was younger .
so , uh , i remember we were first married
and i learned all the health benefits of , you know ,
and , uh , i would have to , you know , put stuff away .
they , they spent more money ,
and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend
it was really terrible .
uh ,
i have n't either .
although i 've stayed in k o a campgrounds , uh , we 've never done that just to go around and camp .
it certainly is frightening .
-- and the way i was brought up ,
but there 's like certain types of country western i ca n't handle --
-- and , you know , they , they do n't appreciate my stand ,
and then that money is used during that month .
but the , the movie did not have anything to do with , with the story that i am talking about .
and we 're like mumblex .
he 's , he 's , kind of , he 's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing .
it 's in east ,
you know there are a lot of people around with ,
when my kids were real little and i was home , i watched ,
but it , it 's a very good company . that --
so i am keep having to scratch his back .
i have three kids ,
and i 'm on my ,
well , i think if we ever go , it will only be for a three day .
and the skunk was a good , a decent pet ,
but the thing that makes me mad is , uh , then they start getting , uh , other people ,
-- so i get it from t v a lot .
that 's good .
well , my family did n't necessarily like , like them as much as i did ,
and boy , it is really nice ,
it takes all my time .
i , i was about to call to get , to see if i could get on with somebody ,
i liked highway to heaven ,
and i 've always , uh ,
and then of course when that movie out of africa came out .
we got a whole bunch .
that 's the thing .
uh , i have a son that is in the fourth grade --
we 're just on a concrete slab , you know --
i , i guess i 'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather .
we 're almost in dallas .
and , uh , i talked to a thirteen year old last night who 's , uh , goes to , uh , one of the plano high schools or junior highs , i guess ,
i went from a , you know , a second rate institution to a higher rate institution .
we 've been lucky .
because , uh , well , like i say , we live a way
you know the kids just think it 's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or ,
and , and so i mean that 's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty-five dollars worth of food a month . so and , and pay for her like , like monthly fee like twen- ,
it 's like , we talked . uh , i do n't want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care ,
or ,
i have a cousin who is , uh ,
and then because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together , uh , in a car ,
we have this dream .
i hate that .
we 've got two bathrooms
and it 's brought to us by two things .
this is with u n backing --
we live out here by , it 's by ogden .
that is what they call them down here .
i 'm sure there is n't .
i , i really do ,
mostly snow removal ,
i had an argument recently with my boss ,
we 're in the sub- , i 'm in the suburb of cleveland
like our principal says , i want every child to be on task all the time .
uh , i , i glance at all newspapers .
as in , uh , martini .
thousands , and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs .
he 's in , in florida jail now ,
he was able to get it down .
well , you know , like some , w- , symptoms , medical symptoms , like when , how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not ,
uh , but in a , in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude
well , mostly right now i 'm a , i do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible .
and i 've always appreciated when she 's sat with them .
but it 's probably the best tasting ,
and it was just a total bust .
you --
but , you know , like , four , i mean fou- , four children is expensive , especially when you consider like , especially for me , which i 'm paying out of state tuition .
it was real kindergarten .
uh , but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your --
they generally were able to have someone care for them at home
i 've tried to get my wife ,
we 're in plano here .
whether companies want to do this
oh , since the beginning .
i will get --
i 've seen the sign that goes to there .
we could not , we could not get it together to drive .
i mean , and they stretched , stressed things like that too .
you know , they have those t v -s right ,
and i do like them .
and then , when they , when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter , it , uh , you know , to get the information and all ,
and he did n't want to listen to it .
um , we did n't have very much money
that 's a good mexican place .
but they were really , adequate ones were really tough to find .
i mean and you 're sixty some or --
and it 's just a hassle to go through it
and then later on the , uh , the administration kept getting worse ,
it sounds like it ,
because you can buy a month 's membership .
i moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio
i have n't looked at rents in a long time .
and then there 's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back .
and there was a fifteen day waiting period .
but , my main thing is space ,
and , uh , i know exactly what you mean .
-- and we use worms and shiners , which is pretty much like minnows --
well , a lot of parents fund their children .
my daughter ,
and you put everything in it .
your two fish .
i co ,
however , my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation . uh ,
i like the ice skating ,
and twenty percent would be one thirty .
or at least i did n't think so .
i was going to bet that ,
and it tore the ligaments in my knee .
parts of town ,
it was , yeah it was unimpressive to look at .
and , uh , it 's , it 's not that big that , uh --
-- i used it , uh , quite a bit when i was , uh , uh , looking at , uh , information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a , in fort worth --
and those are really handy ,
i have n't read it .
and then i , i took a tole --
i really would like to see them do well .
well , we , we keep a little note pad on a , on a wall .
and we were there , we were in new jersey last october --
uh , uh , it 's , it 's , it 's nice .
and i thought , you know , that really ,
we got free tickets because someone at our church , one of the deacons at church , um , parks cars at the mansion at turtle creek which is like one of the , uh , the places and stuff .
you 're , you 're certainly in the majority --
and one 's in the middle of the other ,
but we only have cinemax ,
i mean , i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes , and just say i bind you in jesus name ,
it is , it is interesting , that , that , you know we , we look at the exploitation
but , you know , they 're building the baseball stadium
my kids are involved in sports .
they call it the night of the howling ,
well , i listen to a christian radio station .
i have high blood pressure problems myself .
we , we really ,
so she 'd kind of lay it on occasionally , you know , .
-- but now they , uh , have a golf tournament on the saturday .
patrick stewart was in that .
and , uh , i stay home .
because , uh , there 's a lot of commercial vehicles out there ,
and , you know they have that hour that nine to ten --
and the two of them have played natural trumpets .
i had n't even thought about it being out of the area
-- and i took a novel with me , uh , and read it at thanksgiving time ,
that 's the word , float .
i just figure with the visa and --
uh , up to a point things seemed to be working ,
and this is very much home for me .
you know , you see , you see a lot of small colleges doing things ,
and we 're having a difficult time trying to train it .
-- and the people in virginia are complaining that he is , he 's using texas politics in virginia --
and then we get it and see it that way .
i do n't want anything too real anymore .
and the other thing we 're looking at is the saturns too .
uh , and everything was very convenient
off they go with your car .
well , i was pretty young .
you get these small little , uh , places like iraq and all of that , that might be something that i 'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses , uh , a small , uh , or as big country of u s s r .
so --
and i realize that hey , it 's nothing but four years of endurance
and , i do n't know how ,
and now , i think he barely makes it .
i 'm being a yankee , i guess i 'm , i 'm letting my yankee come out , you know .
i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they 've got , they c , they ca n't charge any more ,
but i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time .
i used to live in amarillo originally .
-- and i 'm taking care of his dog
and now there is no snow ,
i 'm calling you from work .
they have wonderful pi- , photographs and just amazing photographs that --
i mean , he 's , he 's so much fun now ,
but , uh , i personally have n't done anything .
we wore shorts .
but , uh , i 've found that i 've had a lot of luck with them .
but , then it 's experience .
well , you know , there 's this old , uh , jewish , is it , saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
and not only did i walk
we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or , um , doing research , looking at the speech signal and then doing writing , and also as a just as a terminal ,
that was so that he could n't leave her ,
um , i have to be at work at , at x hour , you know , at just , at , at a certain hour
it 's like slow .
and i ca n't find one that i 've done .
and , uh --
i 'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done .
that can help people like me .
it 's going to say , uh , edited by charlotte turgeon , editor of ,
they scream , you know , uh ,
here you do n't , there 's no occupational tax
but she is scared to death of thunder storms .
i really do n't .
and i do n't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore .
and we could n't , we just dismissed the case .
i mean , when i , when , when , when we came to san antonio it was just like , uh , you know , it just , just swelter
and it 's really going to lead the way , uh , for a lot of econ- , um , applications and , and development in the voice area .
and i have them all out
and every one of them have five or six kids . and most of them , you know ,
well they 're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas .
and , and you get out the , the , so many inches
and it was late at night and scary and , you know .
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff .
and , uh , so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it , uh , with his right hand ,
i show , i showed mine to my boyfriend
i worked for lincoln ,
i started reading the --
it was more --
-- and then i put me a little five gallon bucket ,
to tell you the truth , i 'm not even really from here .
real big
it was , uh , about a , a chinese lady and her generations down , her , what happened to her family through the years --
as a matter of fact , they had more trunk space than my , uh , sedan de ville had .
of all the sports that there are , that there is , i like baseball the best .
well , maybe there are some professionals out there .
-- and most of my friends that are my age do n't exercise
so all i have on my desk is my p c ,
plus , i have the , uh , the special lights on , on the outside .
people would come and say could y- , would you come over and make lasagna for me .
because the university makes me buy a small ,
he put up all of his ash trays .
directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty
they , they usually , get back for the , at least two of them for the summer ,
it is good .
right now i 'm busy chasing my kids .
and if you watch television , they usually have television in there or something , or if you listen to a walkman , it is pretty , it is pretty okay .
-- and coppell 's now about the size that lewisville was when , when i moved down here .
but that was , that was my only option .
i 'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one .
so --
i usually do n't intentionally . although i should , i do n't intentionally turn on the television to watch news .
i try not to use them too often .
i , i have , i have some friends who do expert wis- , witness testimony
well , in the , my department everybody gets the wall street journal .
there 's the iowa cubs ,
and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot .
um , but my wife has a real job .
but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore .
i believe you 're right , though .
and people would come from seattle to there and , uh , let 's see , nevada and in that area , washington and nevada to southern utah
the , the le mans is like that , too .
yet i --
well , see , we do n't have any room in our prisons
and that 's , and that 's another interesting question .
well , they , it , the , their , they do have an extremely good , such things as extremely good school systems , for example .
and there 's the history of yoakum county , texas there .
a review usually wo n't make me go see a movie i had n't already wanted to see .
and her character was good .
i 've tried it
so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to disney together .
and i ca n't say that i like a lot of the modern , the very , very --
but today i went to see regarding with henry .
i said so do i ,
and she said no ,
our last daughter , she did not want to go to school .
so , that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things --
by firing squad , as i recall .
so , i was very cut off from the , the press as i , you know , and be , was becoming an adult .
you always stand in line when you go --
that was nice .
there 's a t v and a v c r
but and divide those up between all ,
we still got some from last year .
so my spare time usually involves something with the kids .
that 's how i fe ,
and , uh , but on the whole i think it , uh , probably was the wrong thing to do .
and , you know , i had , i did that ,
-- we drive sixty-five .
and , uh , of course there 's another aspect of this , too , uh , in terms of invasion of privacy
he plays in the fort worth symphony and fort worth mostly .
so . anyway . i do n't know if our five minutes are over yet .
and there 's got to be trade .
now i 'm to the mumblex mother was --
and then he did , uh , he , he , healing the shame that binds you ,
and somebody that went with me bought a carton for , uh , ten dollars and something
i just read this in the paper the other day .
it 's like , wow , it actually fell on the right day .
but my ironing board is part of my decor
an , and a dining room is separate ,
well , i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom , but it usually 's holding clothes .
considering that spock was on an , uh , you know , couple weeks ago --
and they do the recycling ,
it is ,
we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it .
and when the cuts came , three of us got , uh , bounced back ,
they have not been too bad .
it 's funny , when you were talking about sewing , i love to do anything by hand with a needle .
i use , uh , uh , the black iron skillet to cook mine .
he tried to make bagels one time .
well , i , i , i guess if i was having a dinner party i , depending on the number of people , i might cook a , like a brisket or a roast or a , maybe a chicken dish --
we could , um , link in ,
ha- , we have a lot of people moving here from boston and , and different areas
the reason i say that is pretty timely because just tonight i went out and changed the oil in my car
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything .
and we just do n't want that .
his children will be out of high school before he 's forty-five .
there have been some things , you know ,
we deci- , we did n't decide to get one until i started working at home .
did n't have to pay any income tax .
health food , uh , restaurants that ,
uh , one of them is the university of florida golf course --
and i sure would like one ever those , uh , uh , within the next five years ,
and , uh , and , uh , i do the edging and stuff like that ,
uh , we can water , here in patterson , i can water on tuesdays , thursdays , saturday and sunday , four days a week .
uh , today , my favorites out of those guys were probably , um , lambert ,
but i need to see it .
and , of course , they 're , this one the women would be equally grabbed
it , it 's , um , eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here in new york .
so ,
so i found a outfit down here to rebuild it .
and that 's a legend --
but i see , i , i see so much going on that , that 's bad .
lots of their picture and life story and everything .
so , um ,
uh , she was probably the only person in the , um , whole nursing home that , uh , still had all of her mental facilities about her .
and i will find that thing .
an , but now , now , that he 's in this program and , you know , he 's , i guess okay ,
oh , you know i like what i 'm doing right now .
me , either .
my husband liked that --
and the dog never , you know , he treated it like a milk bone
and when our first child was , you know , an infant , um , of course , when i was around the house , i played that music , too .
and i ,
so there is a progressive path ,
it was a lot of sweat
and basically it was a , uh , repayment for , for , uh , high school education ,
and i will get , uh ,
and that 's real hard .
-- and i enter things in our little state fair ,
i avoid the sun .
what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers , this , you know , plus eighty to a hundred pound range .
and working in that condo , you did n't have to do anything --
but i 've never had any personal , you know , i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do with it .
i get a random reimbursement every now and then and do n't really --
i mean they 're a , it 's a small market
i , i 've seen the same thing
and there are cases when you do n't want that to be the case . um ,
and i have three granddaughters right now .
well , now they have those , uh , those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight ,
um , my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen mumblex
but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date .
uh , many of those tanned until the last couple when , uh , we had such an economic slowdown .
it 's just only was three more classes --
i did , i did also .
i do crochet and a lot of , uh , things like that ,
that 's what happened to this guy .
uh , and i also sort of worry that , you know , that sometimes people giveaway personal information .
i used to , uh , get into it and get out of it based on my schedule ,
it was sad , very sad .
and i , i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again ,
well , i certainly hope so .
and the cat would sleep on my husband 's side , you know .
and i said , well put it on because apparently nothing 's guaranteed
and so we , we were thinking we wanted to do , you know , we were going to try doing it ourselves ,
-- and that was the most boring place on earth .
uh , my , my dad 's mother is an invalid ,
and , uh , i had this wonderful recipe
sometimes i think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner --
i was thinking about camping and different i- , people 's ideas about it .
and i never saw him .
and it got so depressing .
and , and , and that was , that , that helped us sort of feel good about , you know , about ourselves and about mumblex one around us , in that at least , at least , if everyone 's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that , at least they 're still going to see the real good movies , you know .
and i went through a , a pretty , i do n't know , i went through a , standard drug testing thing before i , i was brought on .
but that 's it .
we generally just stay on one channel all , for all of monday night , just to watch those .
well , mark , our situation is that we do have a daughter that is , uh , in the situation of choosing college .
and , and , and that 's mainly people that have never had pets around their children ,
i want to see that .
i love gardens that are well tended ,
it 's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine .
probably , um , uh , let 's see , i like the looks of the lincoln town car .
and i just quit too .
-- uh , i 'm originally from the state of virginia --
different rice and ham and things that , uh ,
and they make more money if you extend your loan .
that 's one of my husband 's pet peeves .
and i 'd have to say , uh , i , uh , i do n't know .
and now , i did not go out a lot
that guy that was a reporter for c n n .
and , because , like i say , we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long ,
that , and plus , i mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt .
so i 'll be , i 'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because i 'm , i 'm , if i 'm going to be down on the floor messing with them , i 'm not going to wear nylons and , you know --
when you sat in the seats , they adjusted to fit around you .
but , uh , kind of had the feeling along that , uh ,
i mean , i 'm , i 'm , i can understand baseball , you know ,
and then they just sort of do like a little program or , you know , something like that so --
and i mashed it wrong , or i did something .
and we have one , of course , i say , in college driving . and one going to drive this summer ,
i have a twelve year old ,
that bothered me .
that 's why i said we , in kentucky , we ,
we 're also taking programming classes ,
a , a , it 's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house .
i , i , um , would like to start running .
and , um , you know , i 've watched him grow up
but i also love sports .
i was home alone .
we live next to a set of railroad tracks
the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty-two fifty for one bulb .
the high school is now called , in fact , it was called tulley high school
i 'm over forty ,
and it got shot down .
um , but , uh , i , i , i do like the orioles also .
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other .
but we did n't even have tents there ,
but , uh , just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby , yours sounds great .
when both partners of the marriage work , she feels that that 's taking more away ,
our friend , the president , right now , says no new taxes ,
mine is not as good as a p c , uh ,
take , for the twenty to , hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and , you know , depending on where it is .
but just the play on people 's emotions .
to these people who were on u s dive , the mexican diving , we went to the pool together , and watched them dive and all this ,
he was very dangerous ,
i used to go out of b w i a lot .
and , uh , i have , particularly enjoy the english comedies ,
i , i , you know , i like to , to know what 's going on .
i know a lot of people who may watch the t v news in the evening but do n't spend the time to actually read a newspaper .
and it 's funny 'cause if i turn them out on to a di- , i- , on to like a plate , for them to take what they want , --
we 're still paying --
but , then again i originally was from california
the water 's kind of ,
here in plano we 've got , uh , quite a few .
and , uh .
uh , major dad .
and just this last month we paid off my final school loan .
-- because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays --
and it stays low a lot .
uh , generally i get , uh , you know , most of my news , uh , in the , you know , weekly magazines like time , newsweek and , and , uh , u s news and world report . with , with occasional smatterings of , of , uh , you know , the wall street journal and , of course , the local paper .
they were saying , uh , you know , what new ways could y- , could it , you , you know , change the system .
so , i 've considered even becoming licensed to teach it .
that they take tours and things like that
and somehow --
that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year .
-- so that pays also .
well , when we first moved here , we moved here from lubbock --
i do n't know ,
and they have one at ten .
i do n't know ,
most of my vacationing in the u s has been on the west coast --
and uh , one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if , if you could believe a lawyer or if a ,
and he 'd been convicted three times before , you know ,
but , you know , it 's funny .
i , i crocheted when i was younger .
i hate having to leave the house clo- , you know , closed up all the time .
i 've been through all of that .
that 's another , uh , uh , thorn in my side ,
the whole lot i 'm sitting on is roughly half an acre .
and we got ...
so we 've got everything , you know , pretty much we know what our , uh , our fixed expenses are per month ,
but i have loved this car better than anything i 've ever driven , because you can go on the road and get there
-- the other guy delivered him --
well , my , my dog when i came home , uh , when i come home in the evenings , my dog greets me at the door .
actually i 'm a spectator ,
and i would n't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover , but flip through just for , just to get a good laugh .
one salad that we always like , my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners , is a ,
well i guess , i have to admit that i am .
i do n't know where i really come down on it .
and , she wanted that role .
i had to change the water pump in that , here about a year ago .
i 'll be fifty-seven in june ,
the other stuff is interesting
and i hope that , uh , if we 're successful that they 'll go in for some sort of profit sharing --
i 'd rather , personally rather watch , see a game on t v than fight the crowds at the stadium .
and i am going to try to help them financially
i --
i 'd , i 'd rather rent .
and the , the kids , they ,
and they get out ,
and , uh , it was , it was pretty wild .
none whatsoever .
i can do it in my car ,
and i- , that went on for months and months and months because ,
but , boy if someone did break in , i do n't , i do n't know that i could or would even grab it .
um , the last thing he chewed up was , uh , when we ...
mumblex we had an electrical storm too ,
i saw city slickers .
well , that does n't do me any good because i do n't have any place to burn it .
and taylor bit several times
i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening , some .
and , uh , we would like industry to do more before they build these big , huge incinerators .
so , we gave him up and tried .
so they do n't know who killed ,
and i could , i , i know , i know stories for sure that they just , they , they just , well , they ca n't take the proper care of them .
i guess we 're --
and i got in ,
and my parents live down there .
i do not .
but they did n't use it right , you know .
well , we do n't actually have a budget , budget per se .
but they 're so good about clearing the roads , that , you know , it does n't usually bother you very much .
i do , too .
and there 's a ring
and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time .
-- that has a great , i 've not been there , but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in dallas ,
i , i really enjoy it .
-- but by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed .
well , i , i do about the same , i guess , but in a different fashion .
but it 's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow
i call it my recession job .
so then when i explained to her , look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest , and stuff ,
well , i , uh , i understand what you 're saying ,
and so i try to take , you know , weekend papers ,
i , i use my , only use my credit card for , um , you know , when i , you know ,
but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars ,
i 've taken a cake decorating class
but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus .
but i am , you know , i am between , i am in my late forties --
and he would just dance around the floor
but i always managed to , to get near par anyway .
most of this area was developed ,
and --
and i think there 's a , there 's a real challenge there .
i forget what it was called , uh ,
and so we charged them all up again .
in fact , when my children were growing up , we always had horses
and , and that 's really what we 've learned about it .
-- and with his limited english they found out , thr- , you know , that , she was in student council ,
because baltimore will play more , uh , what might be considered m- , a little bit more progressive ?
then they had , they had the choice , you know ,
it 's mostly just the tunes .
oh , he 's a , richard dreyfuss is a , uh , psychiatrist
and , uh , when i got this one it did , a lit , it heated a little bit warmer
or , just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty .
you know , i have done some bow hunting
he 's , uh , a one owner .
control is something that i would n't want the federal government to have .
broa- , broadcast news , t v ,
it was like , you , you come after me , you 're going to get it .
but i know it has been successful .
and i have n't seen it .
but for me it was wonderful .
and the son was , you know , `` why ? ''
they 're both national level --
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue . which i would not , would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better . and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color . with little purple spots that it , it will fade into a solid purple .
and he buys all kinds of , um , china and figurines and statues and stuff .
because , you know , phone books are pretty ,
and they loved it .
i think there was four or five different people ,
i 've been to the galapagos islands .
um , you just never know when you might come into contact with one .
he is , he is pretty , uh , mobile in that area too .
and my mom had six kids .
i missed that .
actually , i like to read also ,
puts about two more inches on his waistline
the only one that we , we have that we kept was the discover card ,
i thought they were .
so when would go , and we would go to port aransas or then , on down to corpus or further ,
it said one pound
and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody .
well , they , um , i just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized one , these computerized machines ,
so she 's , she 's had about enough during those days ,
just came back from denver
it is .
but it 's got the hardest combination of , uh , metric
i said , i see at least two a week .
and i wanted something else to do ,
we get some killer winters up here in the mountains .
and , uh , nowadays the latest thing i 've , i 've read about in the paper here that they 're doing as far as , uh , crimes involving stealing cars is that , instead of stealing , uh , cars like at night , breaking into them or whatever , they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up ,
i 've seen that in the dealership .
it 's suppose to be a huge stadium
the utah jazz .
i , i grew up in new jersey --
-- and i 've told so many stories about the snakes --
they 're very light weight
but we 're trying , we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and ,
and we go quite often ,
and so i mean something real life , i just ,
i do news , mostly newspapers and , uh , plastic two liter diet coke bottles .
she had her own , still had her own little house and still driving her own car ,
parts of , parts of war of the roses was funny
we 're out in the country --
uh , my dad lives in the state capital , which is pierre --
so now only , i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing --
i ca n't remember what the name of the lake is ,
we see them once in a while , a couple of times a year at least ,
uh , and that 's what he would have liked to have seen regarding henry , too ,
they have scraped the , uh , plaster off the walls , you know , with riding their little toys through it and stuff . you know ,
and we thought , well , wonder how far off we are ?
and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced
and --
carpet cleaning .
. and , and , uh , you know , it was just pulling drag out .
i work with several that were over there ,
now that i do n't go to the grocery store much , it 's kind of moot ,
it is in america where it was hard
we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together .
but , uh , sometimes health care , uh , when you get into a universal system lacks in , uh , what would be considered , uh ,
and i , i 'm going to take it pretty seriously .
i 've only taken , uh , maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow- , uh , down to shreveport .
and so i , and i wanted her to put it into the computer ,
but i really admire people who can go and work out
hey , i 've got another clue for you for college .
i , i should not say i do not know .
i , i just do n't have anything , want anything to do with her any more ,
because , uh , one of the area supervisors , uh , in my area , as a matter of fact , took off , um , for a couple of weeks , when his wife had their baby .
there was n't as many advanced placement courses , uh , when i was a senior --
i do .
i feel real good if i water them
so they came to get it .
we 're on our way .
real tasty .
so , um , anyway , i have a new transmission ,
and i would put it in the sink
it is n't , really , it 's not really good for your knees .
the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time .
oh , i 'm in my paperwork here ,
certainly here they are .
but ,
that 's the girls i lived with
it 's great .
i do n't even have any of my recipes with me .
like , uh , one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby , um , any where between ten and forty hours a week .
the way , you know , you have to just keep reminding yourself that he 's an actor .
-- and i just ,
and so that was fun ,
or it makes an elegant wedding to have --
and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business .
it is real strange ,
and i said well where are the other three .
it 's been a while since i 've seen it .
and that 's the only thing that we do n't like about living in texas , is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall
i mean , i have been up until just a few months ago .
they ca n't get to the these centers .
but it 's still in great shape .
and , uh , as a rule , it sounds pretty decent ,
well , it 's really fun .
they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small , you know , four or five years old , up until they were well into grade school .
and once you 've established the fact that you 're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you 're not . i think they could , uh , save money by not doing that . you know , every time ,
actually , uh , i kind of like soccer .
it 's in johnson city .
our , our whole weekends are divi- , are devoted to our children except for we might go out , you know , one evening or something ,
it 's real easy
and it did n't cost any money .
but i was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since --
and if you keep feeding it until the light goes off .
it 's pretty hot here during the summer --
and that worked .
and i know people that are paying two hundred , three hundred dollars a month for insurance .
and it 's been , uh , it 's been really good for him .
almost got an owl once .
i was going to say , you , you know , you can find certain restaurants that are nice ,
and the lake is beautiful ,
uh , just all this roy tarpley stuff
and it , you know , like on a lake ,
uh , i play the piano --
you know , it 's a very small book
and i , you know , helped them get there as far as --
well , it was worth the buck i guess .
it 's just a suggested topic .
w- , well anyway i guess we 're supposed to discuss this , uh , subject ,
um , it , it involves , for instance , uh , creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium , and barium and , uh , other things from , uh , waste material in general . and , uh , and purify the waste of specific , uh , uh , nasty elements .
i do n't like that ,
i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had , um ,
and he came back .
that 's why i , i really miss it .
most of virginia is clay .
it is ,
it , it got to be pretty straightforward to understand
i spent almost three years redoing .
they just , uh --
-- i was afraid i 'd make the car overheat .
he , he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it .
it 's , it 's the season for them right now .
it was a comedy ,
it was his , like , his ,
there are those teams that play in professional , national football league
so really the plants that i brought over and put out here are just about all .
but , i 'm up at my daughter 's ,
it 's it 's an n b c affiliate down here .
but i do use my treadmill .
and that 's , that 's the food
i 'm a , a counselor and a therapist ,
i grew up in south dakota ,
the other thing i let them do some times is that i let them go through and let them tell me what , let them do the diagnostics .
i guess they 're called those pointed sale terminals where it 's like it goes in the minute ,
i did n't get ,
so --
you know , there 's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever .
and they have got the he man , uh ,
we were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it , too .
they 've got sixty or so of iraq 's planes .
he , he misses it .
but when i was , uh , in high school , it was the beginning of vietnam and so forth .
when this war broke out it frustrated me all thi- , the antiwar people and , you know ,
-- and , uh , mumblex approaches to low minimum mumblex both , both times --
they may have done it .
but it was with a certain list of , of doctors that , you know , participated --
i do n't remember hearing that .
i 'm not actually sure if it is or not
if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can ,
i drove from sidney down to melbourne and over to au- , adelaide .
i ,
and then there 's walrus and sea lion and porpoises , and oh , it 's ,
so it 's , it 's pretty nice , uh , year round .
i , i know for sure that that one about ,
and so i think that we 're going to try that .
i know just , uh , just with me , ten years ago , i was comparing the ,
but my , um , softball unit here is acting like he 's dying of tramane poison .
i was over in , in the research lab a couple , i guess , it 's been about a month ago
and he 's , you know , got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level .
but , i got to do more , more fun things .
so that was n't a question ,
and next week ,
i was up , i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend ,
i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water , two cups , um , broth .
i 'm , uh , thirty-three .
and i would like to maybe not take great long trips , but , but have your home base , where your home is --
and so she brings them up here from philadelphia and gives me all her extras .
i mean --
so that 's all you had to listen to was the ,
i really would .
the place i work at 's , health insurance is kind of expensive .
and linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup
but the makeup of the jury , uh , was truly a cross section of , uh , you might say a cross section of a country .
he was in c c c during , uh ,
and there 's all sorts of things down there .
well , because we have these tow- , uh ,
that was the television show .
and , and they 're wonderful ,
and , well , there is twelve kids in my family ,
and we probably take one of each every year .
and it sometimes does n't .
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that .
they turn it off when they leave .
now there 's almost equally predominant in women .
i always like dessert .
and some , some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active .
so we do n't have to have quite as strict , uh , a budget as we did .
and , you know , i agree with you ,
i , i 'm , i 'm leaning towards doing it --
now this one has been quite mild .
he rebuilt a aranca chief , airplane ,
well , we have n't really heard that much in the news lately , about , uh , u s involvement in latin america , since , uh , all this middle east crisis began .
-- and asparagus .
i 'm being single
-- or at least , that 's the way i look at it .
oh , i know ,
but --
and , and the boy friend thought ,
but this is great , because it was , i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something .
there 's very few i would want to see that many times .
you hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there
and the boy actually rides on his back
the grass was dead everywhere .
so that was four and a half hours a week .
but they did n't , they did n't strip it --
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in .
you know , and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any .
-- but that 's about all the exposure i have to sports .
um , i 've been lucky ,
it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago .
and my children , since i , uh , since they were very young ,
but at the office when i , you know ,
you just know them by the telephone ,
that 's the only obligation we have .
here in saskatoon at least , the majority of central , uh ,
i really do n't use it myself .
and i 'm thinking that this has been pretty , you know , rainy season ,
-- they kind of came out looking like gourds .
since your husband is , is , is , um , a t i -er
we call it service merchandise .
because it 's an association fee .
oh , that 's what ours is .
i started to s- , to knit a sweater .
see that 's the way we are ,
they 've , i think they have maybe two people a year go get , get their p h d .
my , my little boy has gotten so into it that
but --
and after three years of working at it , i 've , i 've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back .
since it 's more expensive , i think , okay , you spent that much money , you 'd better go .
and it will , depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update , it will give you , um , updated information .
in fact , thing has a big , much bigger role than he does in the series .
the first year we were living there , we had to replace the roof .
and he is still living by himself .
but he will not build a second one himself .
and then i was told by somebody that works for j c penney 's that , uh , ross , ross is just one of those places that sell , sells seconds .
uh , i know , like here in saskatchewan , we have our hospital care mumblex the care actually for the older people graded in level , in four levels .
so here , i know that , uh , last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state
because those things are selling like hot cakes .
and e- , i work for texas instruments .
and we saw one movie recently
and when --
i 've had two or three of those go out .
and they come back when they 're putting ,
and then they wanted some gray to do the , to do the trim .
yet there 's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think , oh , but , if we both work , we can get a really big house ,
well , it was with all of them ,
and , you know , i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and ,
uh , and she still drives , which we do , does scare us some , because she has dented a few things , you know ,
well , and a- ,
and i visited other areas ,
the colts still , you know , still to me are the baltimore colts .
and in that , and its properties were great , uh , with , uh , the machinery , did n't have to have lots of expensive machinery to , uh , get your heating and cooling cycles to work .
i consider myself what they call a full-timer .
fifty-five is the minimum
they have to water an incredible amount .
she 'd much rather be here with me .
she likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
three eight six twenty-five c maybe
i , i do n't judge any war as good or bad ,
we really liked it up there
my wife works in , you know , at , at , at the t i ,
and it 's , uh , near a little town called plano ,
in some of those , you know , they , i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about lebanese and , and , you know , and ,
i hope you can understand what i s- , .
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me .
-- and then , i was wondering why my mother always referred to , you know , his second wife as that hussy .
nothing .
and , uh , we are on the , we are third from the end on the electric string .
and , um , i have , right now i have the movie channel ,
that hit the fan like , uh ,
and , uh , you know , it was a group class , outside .
but what worries me is the fact that i do n't like the government telling me who i can see and who i ca n't see .
that 's what , that 's what happened when i , when i first , uh , met my husband .
and , uh , they , get together and just do , they they do all sorts of things
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend , plus after work .
i 'm not sure .
and , uh , you know , a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their , the real , uh , higher ups ,
just , you know , controversy --
i 'm fifty years old ,
and , uh , places like j c penney 's that they 'll reject the seconds ,
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves
you know , i could --
and yet he wants so much ,
i do n't know anything else that 's current other than the weather
uh , somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck .
but chinese is n't my favorite
so she was always , uh ,
he 's a black man ,
because , um , they do n't allow me to work since , uh , i 'm a foreign student .
there 's several guys from our church try to go up there .
i mean you ca n't do it for any compan- ,
we have a computer , here at the house ,
they 're kin- , they 're kind of like the bush roses .
and he , you know , he does n't really enjoy doing it ,
and they keep everyone else away from you .
just to air-condition it ,
but , i very rarely do things like , um ,
not a problem ,
some baby-sitting groups ,
and it may be eight pages long .
i mean , uh , i 'm out in , i 'm out in the wilderness . literally .
trying to remember we had a dog for a while ,
and that helps .
i 'm trying to think of anything else i do as a hobby . um . i do n't even watch t v very much .
but , you ca n't , ca n't ski up there any more .
they usually , uh , they have been happening , uh , just after the summer semester starts .
there 's a lot of things you do as a kid that --
and , well , l- , lot of times we take seventy-five
but , uh , i 'm not planning on doing that for a while .
i can see it now .
-- we do n't care about retirement benefits .
but , um , of course , i watch every saints game that i can watch .
but he ca n't learn like that .
or the wind came from the side
i had no idea that was just for the employees ,
i 'm really struggling with it .
i do not need a recipe to follow .
and we are in the process of potty training .
and the timer would run
i , i , i work for the f b i .
and the people that go to my church , you know
atlantic cafe is down on , i believe it 's on mckinney .
great , nancy .
because it 's a lot of things coming up here lately about her , you know , possibilities of he- , of where she mumblex ,
we , we , my sister uses probably a fertilizer .
and i found that a particularly useless way of studying .
drain off the oil .
that he looks at the things that he eats
i do n't have a boat ,
i do n't , i do n't think i could do that .
since they 'll be going back at the end of the month .
and it 's a mutant cat .
now , up here in maryland , though , we 're j- , just in a voluntary recycling stage right now .
well , see i , i have always used celery , i mean , i have used celery before .
we did n't know that when we bought the house
every , every dollar we , every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage .
so , when i went to physical therapy --
uh , every now and then there 's an error
oh , i think , i think that a woman 's role has come a long way .
but , uh , primarily mine is t v news .
i , i will take a look at the individual score , you know , in the individual stance in the n b a --
they have done a beautiful job .
but they --
i , uh , i just moved down , in fact , from south dakota in , in june ,
as you can see , i 'm inclined towards the mexican type of a meal .
and so we were , uh , very , very , uh , cognizance of , and aware of all these types of , uh , expenditures because it could get very expensive .
it 's , you know , it 's , it 's about the same , uh , same distance from here to s- , to san antonio as it is --
my daughter 's a temp at texas instruments ,
we lived --
but i ca n't remember who it was about .
that was the furthest and then kenyon in ohio which was about six and a half hours
but i 'm trying .
and ,
like the problems that michael and hope had in their marriage and stuff , i can relate to some of those things .
-- but , uh , other than that , uh , i just , you know ,
so he , uh , he manages a plant out here ,
there were parts that were sad .
uh , the other one i would n't leave unsupervised two minutes .
we 've had some sort of major emergencies come up , you know , where ,
i love to fish .
all the things that are against the actual space mission , uh , space ship , you know , how they fall away from it ,
now i have got some daffodils .
i , i cover texas and oklahoma .
and so it was n't so bad .
he said well ghost and turtles .
um , she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just do n't let her out of my sight .
my middle child needs to have , uh , orthodontic , he 's because his , his pallet is squared , not rounded .
but , you know , my dad had his own business
i , well mumblex i was supposed to ,
and they love it .
but , some of them we learned from a book --
my , my sister is very over zealous , too .
so he grew up like in the late fifties
and okay , now we 'll go look for one .
it was n't a strong issue , um , i guess it still is n't a strong issue .
but --
i got one from oklahoma city , and one from california .
and they would still come to our door --
but i , u- , u- , i would never be willing to send quite that much money for , uh , like , uh , uh ,
and they 're going to put ,
i had a , a friend that was administrator in richardson said if the parents read books , then the kids probably would read books .
i 'm not --
i 'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does .
and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree .
well , not that long .
the only thing i 've ever heard about hondas is that the breaks go out first .
but that was n't a real , you know ,
and he , he sometimes makes a huge spot o- , uh , pot of spaghetti --
it was a month or so ago .
they give it to race horses , uh , to get rid of , uh cartilage ,
so , um , she pretty much , you know , just assumed that i would know , you know , how to handle them .
and or they were all in the same ar- , geographical location .
i did , i did not say it was nourishing ,
it was , and then , you know , it was just overcast and rainy for , uh , the next two or three days straight .
they had , uh , a new chevy suburban ,
so let 's say , imagine they had kept going ,
i , i can go on and on about football ,
but i have all these friends that wherever you go , they , they sit down and the next thing you know , they pull out of their , uh ,
-- i mean , they are really in a crisis .
uh , that 's what i do .
and i got one of those jane fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend .
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid .
i 've done that
not that i do n't like reporting ,
so , you know , in seventy-eight , you know rock was starting to get really heavy , you know ,
oh , that 's when , that 's when they took , toured .
and it 's almost , uh ,
um , there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and , you know , crying ,
i did , i did n't give them away ,
-- because since i 'm an international student , they want to send me back to --
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint ,
he , uh , stayed at home as long as he could ,
i want to say garfield
so there 's plenty of room to hold things .
like they have that down there that ,
oh , you do n't have to spend that much ,
well let 's just say he was one of th- , those types that you would n't doubt that he was selling something .
we , in fact , we have gotten out on , on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much ,
i stayed as far away from those as i could .
we do n't get them till , till your seventh year of service till --
uh , it has around thirty-two hundred square feet .
mine is gin .
we 're going to get down , probably down norfork sometime this summer ,
i heard about that .
but it 's a bird sanctuary ,
uh , different , uh , a few different , uh , hybrid tea type varieties .
that 's your account to roll over .
i guess , my dad was hit by a , a drunk driver who was also high --
it 's , uh , it 's really a cost .
and we all held hands and hugged , you know ,
i , i know that because i was writing a paper about it .
i have picked up a show lately on saturday night that i 've really liked
but ,
the , the thing that , uh , uh , that karen , my wife , has , has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what , no matter how bad their teachers are ,
that came , it comes to the simple things like front end alignments --
you know , made it more difficult to get a , a , uh , a handgun .
i do n't ,
i just do n't understand that .
i 'm here .
now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars .
i , i do it on my own schedule .
that 's it .
well , that 's the thing my kids like to do that with , you know , on dates and stuff .
i find the joy of cooking to be a remarkably useful book --
-- but , um , i guess , um , the one time that i saw him there , you know , as far as the surroundings , that seemed okay .
and , i thought i would really miss that .
and sometimes i teach in the evening
oh , because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night , you know ,
well that 's about the way our weather is here also .
my last vacation was actually in morocco i guess
i am glad i raised guys .
when you do a lot of outside , like running and stuff , it 's just so much easier ,
they 're always willing to help you out .
and they said , well , bring them in this week for a free day
i looked at the mitsubishi galant .
uh , i do own a p c here at home
and this thing says that , that , you know , it- , people think , well , cow manure is good for fertilizer
you know , you get your little sousa book
um , we want to see godfather part three also
i did not want to call attention .
and we 've had a few of the health fairs up here
i 've even had some of them ,
and we usually serve fresh fruit and , uh , then make a dessert .
but at the same time it 's really not , it 's not like going to m i t .
designing women is on that night ,
-- and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
so , you know , they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and --
and yet i 'm proud to be an american
since kareem 's retired ,
and she 'll stay outside for , oh , thirty minutes to an hour , come inside and use the restroom .
and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months was n't the second two months .
well , we place a real high priority on education in our family .
the opposition will say this , this and this and ,
so we always , he watches that
i saw that with my cousin , just to see what , you know , what the kids are into --
and , and i mean , and there 's things that we 've gone metric .
they 're coming from the middle ages , basically .
but that , that tee shot , uh , it , you know ,
well , uh , and that 's an idea that 's been around for , kicked around for a long time .
but i did n't .
well , there are all different kinds .
east texas is recruiting for ,
when we moved here to monterrey it was a big change , because it 's such a small community ,
good , that 's great to hear .
because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and , uh , growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for o- , not only the people that are living today , but for the future also .
all the time . i got real used to it then .
um , and we try not to use them for --
my all time favorite is weekend at bernie 's .
see around , around here it 's like , uh ,
so i 've discovered that , uh , impatiens that tried and true is , turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus .
so we , uh , we look at the paper ,
i got her for christmas from my family , and , uh , back when we lived in nebraska .
but , um , they do that
one summer we , uh , we went up to new england
and , uh , seems like they have the local news and they have the world news .
-- it , it was enjoyable for a while , um ,
and , and i , i helped him when i was growing up ,
we do n't have too much industrial pollution .
it will be three years in august
he 'll , he 'll take them out just to be with them .
you know that some of the benefits , i would rather have , um , money .
i knew that .
and because the university , the university offers me two plans .
-- and i do , actually , hit the ball better .
um , it 's going to be a big experiment .
but it is more run off --
so if you were familiar with atlanta , uh ,
and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time .
-- but when i delivered ronnie , he was not on call --
well , that 's , we have done that .
it 's just a problem with learning .
other than the u s census , um ,
well , i think we 've done it .
i am , uh , not into novels at all really , oth- , other than historical things .
because i 've been doing a lot of fertilizing .
we bought a , we only had one car for a long time ,
you drive through burger king now and the bags are recycled paper --
you can , i know in the push up , at least , you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up --
and then detroit kept coming back
that will not do .
uh , i 've been a mechanic ,
i do n't know what kind of , i do n't know what g m corporate , kind of hit the , i do n't know what kind of hit they take on it ,
if it had , the seat belts on the door now --
i mean it 's really hard to find a place that 's going to offer water aerobics because what i 'm finding is that if they do offer it , you get the crowd of women that are , ,
i do n't like to get one of her books
they 're real fat little white things ,
uh , that does n't mean to say longer ,
seventy-fifth anniversary .
i 'm from here originally ,
and see , i 've had somebody tell me that regarding henry , you know , the harrison --
and it was , it was leaking inside the car ,
i know they do do some , they do have some classes in , um , high schools and things for kids to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like and the , uh , you know , and , uh , that kind of thing
i know my daughter saw that
otherwise he wo , you know , he has to take the physician that , uh , and the hospital that the company has chosen as their , you know , the one they have taken .
five hundred of them are good , solid kids
but , uh , uh , some fish steal it off the hook sometimes .
i know we 've had this one lady that was attacked , you know .
and i went , got to walk in the gas chamber --
and he 's got a lot , a lot of tools ,
i live in a motor home .
but i probably talked to seven or eight people .
i really am , a , am concerned about is that , uh , so many of these child care places are , are coming under , uh , uh , you know , investigation for , for , uh , you know , child molestation .
that 's the reason i said you know , there was such a big difference you know , in a little economy car ,
it did pretty well ,
that 's the name of it .
she was really terrific .
and , uh , finally we made it back to , uh , to carney
and then at the end i had to be too serious .
just , just every little bit does ,
and we 've got grandchildren now ,
and they got like several new color t v 's for the people ,
-- and when you 're in jail , they take you out just like they do in alabama or anywhere else , what they call a chain gang .
and it got hydrocarbons in there .
when i go back home to my parents in illinois in the winter , you know , and their grass is fairly green .
my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think .
i , i , i like , not just with the pittsburgh , i like watching on saturday afternoons when they 'll have like the plays or the , the best plays from ,
so it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains
uh , we had all our flu shots taken care of , our measles , mumps , rubella and all that other stuff .
say out , instead of out you say out .
they sent us a little booklet ,
so they just notify everyone by mail , and
you know , we 've been throwing paper out there away for years ,
and , uh , you know , so , it 's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be .
um , i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding , uh , child care ,
and , and --
but we do n't do much in the way of , uh , flowers .
it 's about two hundred people , maybe .
i 'm not , uh , i have one again at u t down there now ,
then he went out to s , to southern cal .
the wagon , the wagon driver .
and they come up every year
and , uh , this one , we bought by accident ,
the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman .
but , um , my , again , my mother back in indiana ,
and i use the celltrex .
and , you know , and specifically , nudity , things like that , uh ,
u- , usually you 'd see these big chain gangs out there , picking up trash .
uh , if sometimes , if you charge ,
i do n't , i do n't know what changed that pattern .
and i believe at the time that i was down there , that , uh , the government , uh , the salvadorian government mumblex you know , really gotten out of hand yet ,
well , actually i have four kids .
well there 's a couple scenes , at , at the end there 's , there is , you know some blood and everything
and , and one gal , she started a business ,
and we just started looking around .
the only real restrictions they have are , uh , no halter tops and no shorts , even the long walking short of the squirts , the , the split skirts ,
i , i do n't use , i , i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust , you know .
-- and , uh , so a lot of times they have the , the , the , international films downtown --
well , i think that 's about , uh , that 's about covered it for me ,
uh , two , actually --
but everyone else in my family does .
i never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock ,
but , uh , i first started camping out in the desert in california .
it 's usually when we 're out of town --
so , but , i get to come home at , on the nineteenth
my mom , used to go crazy , every sunday , until my dad like blew up , you know .
i do n't understand football .
and that was , you know , a big selling point too ,
uh , you get a president 's award if you 're , you 're in , in high school doing cer- ,
and , and then if i 'm lucky , i might be able to hear something through news wise .
and he came in , you know , and did the inside for us ,
she worked before she got married ,
we 've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late --
and she told me what she had requested .
we , we , consistently ,
and because i knew all along that 's what i wanted ,
and i , uh , uh , i moved to a t i facility that , um , had never had , uh , random drug sampling before ,
well , well , we live , we live really close to lake champlain , which is in the champlain valley ,
just chilling .
so , in my spare time , i love to sew .
old yeller . uh , big red .
when it was ,
i , i , i have friends with hamsters and gerbils
well , i guess since this time last year i 've changed , uh , jobs within the firm i 'm with --
one place i think i did n't take her .
and so we take it
and i think that , uh , got deep seated into me .
i 'm getting me , uh , i want a german shepherd .
so --
i have to find a place around here that has that .
i know now because i ,
like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed
i mean , i do n't know what happened last time .
celery and onion and ,
new york does not --
and i , i try to be polite ,
on some days , uh , it 's , uh , i do n't know
well , that scares me because if th- , that 's the way they are ,
uh , i never felt like it was mine or anything ,
we had cre- , i had probably twenty credit cards --
you had to be sure you left the doors open , you know ,
i 'm not talking about your isolated occurrences ,
we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number ,
and i 'm twenty-three ,
and now they 're saying what 's cholesterol ,
and i do n't have a problem at all with employers , uh , testing in the hiring process ,
there , there are tons of apartments down here , i mean ,
i , i , you know , i mean i think of the young girl in florida who ,
they have bins --
ours is a commodore one twenty-eight .
they have rolling hills around here
it was real interesting .
but i 'm really having questions if , if i can deal with that system and , and have a good conscience about , you know , what i do .
i , i saw , i see that a lot too , there .
i 've , i 've sort of always felt like with buicks it seems like all buicks to me look alike ,
i guess that 's what 's happening to me ,
and , and i liked , uh , aerosmith and --
and , uh , they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty .
it 's a heck of a lot different .
so my cat was trained to go outside ,
and , of course , they have the , um , dumpsters , uh , the , the igloos .
i mean it was a big one ,
and , and it just drove me crazy .
i do n't have time to sit , i know .
like they still get their allowance ,
that would be awful .
actually , well actually there is a , a way ,
it seems like it 's changed so much ,
so , i really feel that it is a real invasion , they 're invading my time and my space --
i did n't know that .
but i like the n b a play-offs ,
so it 's been good .
they made it to the playoffs finally
they say you kind of act how you 're dressed a little bit ,
i , i do n't work .
i , i try to refrain from their use as much as possible . um , for a number of reasons , one of which is the , you know , extreme interest rate on most of them .
well , nannies have been an option , uh ,
and , uh , actually bec- , beforehand they told me they were going to , uh , do drug screening ,
it was the one where he was a defense ,
and now again , i 've got three vehicles
but i was , i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
so that 's how we spent most of the time with him .
it 's full time work .
they do list , um , you know , list the fat ,
-- so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner ,
because i remember our family , well , we , we , we went everywhere .
it still echoes .
off , now , off the tee .
and it , it was a real good movie .
and since then we have lost , oh , well , just our grandmother .
but now that i 'm there , i mean , it 's , it 's a lot more convenient because there 's so many kids that doddle .
i mean it was great after growing up in michigan and not , and al- , you know , every day was cloudy ,
it was something like discuss pollution .
and i know if i go home and say , oh , let 's go camping , my --
we , we built a shed over the long way ,
oh , i did n't realize that actually .
and i be , i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our ,
tha- , i highly recommend that way to go .
i like the idea of , uh , being , uh , a mandatory thing for welfare .
and then they go into the fourth grade
and they say well , they 're trying to deduce what he or she is ,
it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings --
and it 's working well .
and i , i feel like i got a good college education
if the , if the , if people lose their jobs , then they become a load
and , and then materials coming in --
they 're s , going to start to see their return --
and , well , when we leave the doors open , they fly in the house .
i do n't have an ethnic maid .
but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her .
not that i think he was good looking ,
my other son is just as happy as a bed bug .
but you know , they , one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them , you know , you wo n't have a record because you 're under eighteen .
i ca n't remember what it 's even called now ,
and then they 'd pull it back ,
i , um , gosh , i ca n't even think .
we had fleas in our yard real bad last year ,
and it 's interesting ,
i 've done , um , little commercials and background singing
we went to one italian ,
so , unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together , it is kind of like .
sam 's is part of wal-mart .
and my reasons are based upon not only from what i read in the newspapers , what i see on the newspapers , but up against some of the , fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group .
this was a big one .
and last year was the first year we tried two new things .
now my older son was adopted
everybody else but one has been in texas .
but he needed the medical treatment
and then in the summertime you could put him out
um , and from that point i went to law school .
i do n't know ,
it 's gone .
i do n't , i do n't , i , you know , i 'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends .
act- , but , you know , i say that
i , i --
you know you can always make it hotter ,
but one of our favorites is pappasito 's .
well , i know , uh , uh , in michigan , uh , the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it ,
-- but plano , maybe five percent of the plano actually were from texas .
we just sort of lit them .
you know , and , and i mean , it was , i thought a lot ,
if i was in a public restaurant , seated at table with , uh , non smokers i would try to pick a s- , a , a my , seat where the smoke would blow away from them .
well , it 's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the humane society .
i mean , that beats any offer i 've heard in a long time .
like , we just bought a new house ,
but it got too expensive ,
he , like he , you know , like he wants to be best friends now --
on monday nights we set aside time where it 's called , uh , family home evening
and they , at that time , they had no testing whatsoever .
-- and i have a tendency to work late .
for a while i 'll ask people if they know what happened --
but she , she 's gone three mornings .
the draft age .
uh , most the time if they were , they were ,
and so people move out one more valley and ,
see , that was a rerun .
and they roll real well and maneuver .
they could n't put anything in it hardly .
oh , plus we watch a little t v together .
oh , that is , that is the most precious movie .
we 're expecting our first baby ,
but we have been able to find do- , dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays .
and the thing about it is --
it 'll save me a lot of money because i 'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition --
well , so many of us came from a long way that we , we 'd usually at a motel
so , if you are looking for a french recipe , that was good .
you know , there 's nothing in there that can wrap around the , the , uh , rollers or anything .
you know , uh , we paid cash for car .
i said the restrictions i would like to see on , for anybody , whether it being for handgun , a rifle , a shotgun ,
french cooking .
and then he got hit by a cadillac .
and he 'll tell me what a great day he had , and about this great shot he made and everything mumblex .
i mean , i , i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals . uh ,
and , uh --
because i have family there
-- uh , at least that 's one number for this range of numbers i have , i have heard .
here it says , uh , it says
well the last couple of processed foods ,
i learned because i , i just , uh , learned , you know
it is .
i was in the peace corps and , um ,
well , it , it , it went pretty , pretty quick from what he said .
i have n't tried any needlepoint yet .
so , i mean , it , it , it 'll , if it stands the test of time , we 'll see .
uh , not that i really think that they were perfect ten , twenty , or thirty years ago ,
and i had four non exempts , um , under me .
it looks complicated to me .
actually some friends of mine and i are planning to camp this summer , uh , for four days .
and , and , uh , i 'm not a jimmy johnson fan .
and besides that i , uh , you know , i have a set amount that i save every month .
i have a twin sister
we in the united states have more ties to europe and everything
and he said that he has never gone anywhere before ,
and , and then when we go to sleep at night , you know , it 's like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us .
and that was just trying to hold us ,
and the other will continue to swim in college ,
but those are pretty stripped ,
i 'm amazed by ,
i 'm not exactly sure what they 're burning .
i mean , i only heard portions of that
it 's just part , it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for .
and , you know , my children brought it to my attention .
and i 've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three .
because --
probably seven or eight years .
and ,
but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife ,
my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of m i t .
but out in the country , i mean ,
i mean they just go down the ice .
and , uh , we put him in amrein 's day care , after .
and dogs take a lot of , a lot more care than cats do .
because i , i work for myself --
you know , by the time the final came around , i was n't even where i could wear a shoe yet ,
we 're probably like most am , american families , i guess , that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got at the end of the month ,
i do n't too much ,
you know , i do n't see that kind of sand here . um ,
so i adopted the , uh , uh , the houston astros ,
uh , i 'm aware of other people smoking now .
so that was n't too bad .
and he asked me if i had any kids .
but he did not want to be in a swim factory .
i 've never heard of it .
what , in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the , the next generation or so , i guess i anticipate , uh , an increasing equality , uh , greater presence of women in management roles --
and , uh , it , it , i think that they 're , they 're much more comfortable there .
retired , but .
it 's like a fifth , like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange .
i pay for my own life insurance ,
we actually had a little baby --
and i do n't think it was my fault because i- , i , you know , i had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it
we talked about that one too .
and we put that in disposable bags ,
now my father 's almost eighty .
and it was --
that 's a nice area .
i really did n't care for the either two of them .
i do n't know exactly what that is ,
cause i know that skiing in utah is , is suppose to be great .
and he 'd saved up his allowance , you know , and picked him out a bird in a bird cage
we , we save most of our aluminum cans and glass --
he was , had an attention deficit disorder ,
well , i have n't noticed , uh , i have n't noticed richardson , you know , making that big a ,
i read quite a bit , probably do n't read as much as i would like to .
and all you have to do is just put it in a , uh , the sp- , spelling check mode ,
i could n't see him until like tuesday because monday night football , if i did n't ,
i can hear it at the , uh , uh , oh , the college town nearby when i 'm in stillwater , which is about an hour away ,
i have .
-- and , uh , i made some comment
they 're needing to open a new landfill , or to expand onto the old landfill .
and --
but that was it .
i love shark steak ,
and i 'm i 'm not a typical student .
i do n't either .
so many times .
but what i found recently is what they 've been doing is they , they poll somehow the area ,
so i can be at the , at the beach when the waves start coming in .
and so --
you know , and he said , i get a kick out of it , you know ,
there 's a lot of things that they do n't do in school anymore .
well , uh , i have two children ,
because i have my own .
well , um , i have gone to girl 's camp a few times , as a , you know , a chaperon or a leader , whatever --
it was a four day --
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months .
uh , one of the books that i bought , where it 's d , describing the sponge painting , said you can like layer different colors
and , you know , and you ca n't , uh , you ca n't afford , you know , a , a car payment now .
and he was a real , a real lovable type ,
and it takes them something like , thirty days to complete a house .
and i 'm just really not interested in --
well as a matter of fact , i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time , because .
so , uh ,
and now they have to clean those up ,
silence of the lambs kept me on the edge of my seat .
and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why , why it was ,
oh , ch- , see channel , where i am channel eight 's , um , like public t v ,
so they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars ,
probably seventies , eighties in the afternoon .
and , uh , i do n't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a fin , a financial application , all that information on there is really not necessarily ,
i mean i got in to it ,
we 're together a lot on special days
um , some of the , some of the rock stations now are the , i guess the top forty stations or whatever .
and i 'm just about ready to finish my master 's degree ,
in one part , the guy goes out of jail ,
-- you know , i said , this is absurd ,
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains .
maybe this climate is a little better .
and , uh , seattle is on puget sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains .
every time he left the enterprise , everything went to hell .
and so they told me about this project .
he manages the troops
it does improve the reception a little bit though ,
that 's something moves that slow .
i believe it 's tentatively scheduled for sometime in may of this year ,
i guess we were n't going ,
and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep .
but i always enjoyed watching them ,
well , we 're fortunate in that we , so far , knock on wood , most of us have been relati- , real healthy --
and of course when we were living in texas , it was real convenient with tom thumb .
graduating , uh , high school in sixty-eight . um , i remember when the peace corps movement first came about ,
they had , uh ,
when they call up and want to say , well tell me this , this , this , this and i 'll give you a free something or other ,
uh , well , just last weekend went to davy crockett forest --
and i did n't loose it until two years ago
i like a baked cheese cake , you know ,
i 'll be in town or something
but it does n't do anything for them .
-- we , we did n't have too good luck with it ,
um , and i think we choose very , very carefully the , um , alternative situations that we had them in .
they seem to , to last .
i do n't have a storm door ,
and i leased it on a twenty-four month program .
whether it 's drugs or any other kind of , uh ,
it was like john feinstein or something like that --
i mean , i , i- , i- , i do n't , i 'm not a , a big , um , pure power hitter anyway .
you would n't know that .
and i think , oh , it 's on sale i have to get it ,
i ca n't think of any examples
i do n't feel good
her grandmother lives there --
and i enjoy reading books about um ,
and i was going through here
i do n't know the infor- , i do n't know that much about it ,
it 's out in the country
well , my mom 's , um , parents , they 're both in their , in their , uh , eighties ,
this one went on a credit card ,
but , uh , they , uh , even for interns they , they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing ,
we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago ,
i 've , uh , i 'm kind of stuck on them right now , i guess .
i , i , i fi , find myself going to work knowing that , that there 's a job about half done at home ,
i 've voted in every major election since i turned twenty-one .
they are my favorite team , too .
i love , uh , i , li , i especially like instrumentals .
well , i like most of them except for country music .
uh , and i cook a little bit now .
and , um , so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and , and , um , how much , um , beverages we were going to need and this and that ,
and , uh , he only gets seventeen miles a gallon .
but , uh , i think we have one of the nicest yards in the , in the neighborhood .
and i , i had driven it a few times
it keeps me very busy .
and i , i make enough money by the hour to make up for that .
and then i find out that he helped rid the united states of the gablers .
and i said , gee whiz , for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a , a motel --
and we are really saving a lot of money .
they were able to sell it for some amount per ton
i do all the time .
and what 's really neat about it is , the shrimp is cooked in your , uh , like your rice steamer ,
i guess i have n't .
and our neighborhood is a planned development with , i think , it is seven hundred and fifty-five families .
uh , we have a lot of cotton mouth ,
then , uh , another friend of mine went ,
uh , one book that she wrote that 's good for both men and women is fine things ,
uh , i love scott peck and his road less traveled .
and they , they goofed up bad on my fir , on my very first bill ,
in fact , i have been real disappointed in the six years that i 've lived out here about lot sizes .
my impression of it is that it has , that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty .
th- , this love cuts like a knife .
and he said it 's a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations .
i work in mumblex .
what you find is sort of middle eastern foods .
-- at least her daughter ,
-- and , uh , we 're , uh , i , i 've kind of got my fingers cr , crossed .
and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i 'm interested in any particular one .
um , do n't really know ,
but , uh , that 's , that 's why i like the , the outdoor stuff a ,
well , uh , it 's similar to that ,
i do , too .
but the thing is , there 's like eighty-six home games per year .
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they , or just real talented i should say .
but i think his attachments at home
-- so i 've always been involved , you know , in one .
like , um , we- , i have , i come from a family of twelve children ,
so it 's not a new home ,
but i i wanted my front wheels ,
i also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents , um , children who will lie and cheat
but along here it 's , uh , very , very different from the texas type weather .
i probably watch television four hours a week , max .
i enjoy that a lot .
and i guess they were doing pretty good up to a point ,
if someone says , do you want to do this tonight , uh , and i got a mountain of things to do , it 's okay , you know , we do it .
and we save our newspapers ,
-- and then night court is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know ,
i would too .
and i just think , how can you do that ?
it 's , it 's just a , uh , c- , a cafe ,
uh , and , and i just could n't do that ,
disc brakes do n't seem to give me too much problem
and generally the people ,
-- and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program .
um , i do n't think there is any prohibitions .
-- and --
i remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns
um , i do n't swim much , neither .
it did n't , it did n't quite pass .
they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs
i know they s- , they 're coming out with some v eight now
the changing roles of women , how roles changed
you know , people --
but , you know , it 's funny ,
it was , uh ,
and mumblex , it has n't happened to me in the couple of years that , you know , it 's been in progress --
and we , we we 're never able to take vacations because there 's , there 's twelve kids in the family .
i think , i think they 're military .
we have , we could have credit cards running down our ears .
and , uh , i read a lot of science fiction .
they go , yeah ,
my dad worked there for years , and years .
so that was upsetting .
and my husband liked it better than he did hawaii .
it is ,
or slots is what it 's called .
and the got cross pollinated by the bees --
i mean , she , she reads all kinds of books ,
i drive a honda accord .
now i like , i like groups like that .
see a little bit of texas i 've never seen before .
and we were just kind of like ,
that was really the big deal in our household , was the ed sullivan show .
i , i wish they were n't role models for everybody ,
personally , i do not care for them . uh , although i find them a necessity in business and so forth ,
-- and they go out to the other , you know , the in-laws in between some of this ,
and i just at the time , um ,
i had four brothers ,
of course , if somebody in , in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions , well , i do n't know what 's going to happen then .
well , i 'm not either .
and then , i used to work for t i
i never thought i would get rusty ,
or i get bored pretty easily
because it 's just , it 's along the erie canal up here .
i do n't want that .
the , the first guy , you know i just assumed it was a guy , the first person ,
i was thinking of , like , uh ,
and you can call them culottes all you want
but , i mean , other than that , you know , there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses .
well , most of my camping ,
so i mean i 'm not , i have n't played in years
and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they do n't read or speak english .
it was , it was a marvelous experience because after that , then all i had to do was , uh , follow the instructions , you know and do .
and that 's about it , because otherwise i 'm reading so much for school .
i 'm in wisconsin ,
i 've never heard of that .
and you can always , you can always heat it up again , and save , you know .
s- , so moving up thirty-five , i stopped when i got to denton . uh .
and clean ,
i mean , i have my favorite things that i do ,
oh , stockton .
they 're both different people , too .
and i think that 's almost exclusive me , -ly my first of the news .
and they have subtitles ,
my sister lives in turkey ,
and , and i think that , and i know massachusetts has ,
i do n't care how fu , full she is ,
and i 'm fr- , originally from long island .
i do .
uh , i know some ,
sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the discovery channel .
and they did real fine during the summertime
uh , there 's not as many sea shells along there , uh ,
the , they 've , uh , uh , gone through a couple years ago here where they , uh , will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals
we have a , we do , uh , uh , middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually ,
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here ,
and i guess , uh , that was my , that 's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy . for people outside the family , of course ,
and their heads are always poking past the door .
how many --
i said , oh , they 're playing one of their ten --
and i should have been to two
well , i know our son and daughter-in-law live in plano ,
so we do a lot of things with perennials and , uh , also a few annual plants , uh ,
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom ,
i , i 've been working ,
uh , aluminum plants .
we , we 've seen that ,
we , uh , we 've gone through the same things with ours ,
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they 're in almost every shopping center ,
so they put up , uh , a quarter inch masonite , basically ,
i 'm paying , you know , three thousand ,
they can have paternity leave , as well as maternity leave .
i did n't rip them up .
and , you know , there was no way that was going to make it ,
see i have an unlisted telephone number ,
we never could get it declared a lemon ,
and they did have , uh , you know , the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems
i went there looking at a used car
and i have a sixty-nine cougar , which really is , i 'm saving because it 's , it 's old ,
well , i 'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is , um , uh , doing all right
actually , i do n't even know if i checked that or not , to be perfectly honest . um .
it 's like there ,
it would go on that
i mix it until it just tastes good to me .
i do think there is probably an influence there , because i noticed that even though popular music , the , the wilder stuff , was around when my older children were , were , you know , adolescents , early adolescents , when they first start listening to music on their own --
and he goes , human nature .
once a year i 'd say , here 's how you do the budget in case i get sick ,
i want to see it .
well , we , uh , left here in seventy-six .
and the guy around the corner is being transferred
but , you know , the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the , uh ,
but it always seems well , it just felt different like when we were in texas .
and i 'm always trying to ,
they have a fish that 's called an oyster cracker .
and it was really a lot of fun .
i 've never bought a new vehicle in my life .
it 's a , uh , ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater , cardigan --
i feel the exact same way .
and we go to on the border .
and if not we ca n't , because it 's cheaper --
and i thought , well gee , i 've , i 've never known it to lightening at that temperature .
you know , texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country .
oh , i love those ,
and i , i have to admit i 'm not as informed as them ,
so if the customers are willing to pay it , then you get a profit .
so . we try to ,
of course , get a guy like cecil fielder , you know ,
well , i have talked with a number of vietnam veterans ,
you know , they 're just real color , colorful --
i know it ,
-- but , uh ,
and , uh , it 's fine ,
so we --
i , i 'm glad ,
i figure all our c ds that we have what i really like .
i have that on my , uh , computer here
but they 'll let you look down the hall .
so this is like the first thing that 's written down
she 's twenty-one years old
the only thing i ,
but they keep complaining they do n't have the money to do it .
