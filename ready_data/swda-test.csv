31360,sw3203,sv,That 's important too .

183259,sw4133,sv,"Uh , and , you know , it certainly does n't seem to be a deterrent . Uh , for one thing because it 's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly do n't think the people that are committing the c- , crimes that would be eligible , you know , really care ."

161249,sw3332,sv,"because sometimes , uh , there 's times when you may , maybe could n't take advantage of something --"

110954,sw3805,sv,"Well , that 's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media , which takes a heck of a beating and , and deserves some of it , is telling us , you know , about the problems ."

149441,sw3343,sv,"I , it 's hard to say ."

42639,sw2839,sv,"We , we have said that , I 've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea- , two terms is enough for all of them ."

98133,sw2362,sv,"Well , I think , I think , I , I mean what we 've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers --"
164197,sw2436,sv,"So ,"
74889,sw2160,sv,"Because in the country , people still respect , uh , the property of other people ."
171216,sw2790,sv,and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
108450,sw3225,sv,"I think it 's like once a month ,"
23925,sw3769,sv,and I do n't think there 's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have .
151484,sw3047,sv,"It 's kind of interesting to , to , to talk up , you know , your ,"
194801,sw4129,sv,that would be the intent of it .

115334,sw3804,sv,The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor .
173615,sw4113,sv,a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms
169393,sw3099,sv,"And , you know , I just find that incredible ."
185435,sw4108,sv,and it 's beautiful
13201,sw3500,sv,"In , in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot , I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem ."
27741,sw3208,sv,"I mean , I think center day cares there 's so many people coming in and out --"
206765,sw3161,sv,"They , uh , you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they 're all so serious , you know ."
79788,sw2324,sv,-- the American family does n't need any more pressure .
25888,sw2898,sv,"they shoot so much ,"
28940,sw2834,sv,"I think now when both are working they have a more ch- , more of a chance of working together because they 're starting out that way ."

39229,sw2693,sv,"And it , it makes you more aware of what you 're eating ."
65936,sw4023,sv,so maybe that counts .
169582,sw3256,sv,those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment .
195589,sw4109,sv,"When you have the knowledge , you 're you 're not going to , uh , you know , be let go ,"
2307,sw2788,sv,"Most of the time now it 's a necessity ,"
200394,sw4019,sv,Otherwise they 're pretty smelly .
63163,sw2545,sv,but you have to have a need .
146113,sw2253,sv,some of those get very philosophical
97707,sw2648,sv,"it 's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just ,"
105596,sw2962,sv,"So apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person the , you know , any felony anyways ."
189396,sw2395,sv,"But they , they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories ."
156482,sw3375,sv,"And , unfortunately , there 's not many places to get that money ."
13652,sw2368,sv,"and now we say , Gee , Dallas really is big and polluted ."
105948,sw2616,sv,"I mean , and , and , the expenses , you know , of the war , you know , it 's like , uh , it 's like who 's gaining on this ."
165251,sw3296,sv,"It 's kind of a hassle when you have this ,"
127623,sw2180,sv,"and it 's just that I think they 're just tieing up the , um , whole judicial process ."
43070,sw3009,sv,So she was going on those two instincts .
186914,sw4325,sv,I guess --
114546,sw3330,sv,"They 've just gotten so huge ,"

194273,sw2451,sv,"in his , in the Congress they , they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned , which is , gives him more power overall , which I think is a good sign that there will be some , you know ,"
196318,sw4333,sv,"it 's really , it 's a hard balance . It , it definitely is ."
141969,sw3002,sv,And I feel like they sensationalize things that should n't be sensationalized .
39825,sw3250,sv,"unless you just want to skim through while you 're ,"
70987,sw4184,sv,"but also some poodles , uh --"
104064,sw3049,sv,"Plus , by the time you get a baby-sitter , and then pay to go to the movies --"
213904,sw3134,sv,I guess we 're both lucky .
59148,sw3489,sv,and we might be able to incorporate some of that .
90402,sw4071,sv,"it is n't ,"
188393,sw4339,sv,"-- and , uh , whatever I get , I want to have , uh , air bags , uh , both driver 's and passenger side and four door because it 's much more convenient if you 're carrying anybody to , you know , rather than have them stoop down to get over ,"
127823,sw4927,sv,"normally that would interfere with college , I would think ."
99126,sw2094,sv,"So instead , we spend billions of dollars going to war ."
103607,sw3666,sv,"they ,"
147420,sw2490,sv,"they 'd have that respect for what it does ,"
24343,sw3247,sv,"and um , you know , so we 're having problems in , in that way ,"
107354,sw3381,sv,It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me .
113029,sw2579,sv,"Well , uh , well here what they do and I , I contend that it 's certainly not the right thing to do , they spread salt ."
155024,sw2584,sv,"You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff ,"
77095,sw2734,sv,Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted .
155108,sw2584,sv,You 're not old at all .
51244,sw2576,sv,"-- and , uh , well , I , I think what 's happened , too , is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that , and there 's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up , aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day --"
168138,sw3328,sv,"And you end up owing , you know ,"
170626,sw3344,sv,"I 'm , I 'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it 's worth more to them than if you give it to them ,"
98931,sw2137,sv,"Uh , I think that , uh , really it would n't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service ."
147316,sw2490,sv,"And , uh , and I think it kind of took that uh , neatness away from it , you know ,"
86986,sw3150,sv,But the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
72219,sw2840,sv,And that 's not their problem .
125428,sw2631,sv,"and I bet if we trace back to their ,"
45086,sw2323,sv,and it 's legal in a situation like that .
71398,sw2041,sv,"Well of course in the cities ,"
151929,sw2012,sv,"because ,"
208657,sw4033,sv,"but other than that , you really do n't know what 's going on ."
51549,sw2610,sv,"and , and you 're , you 're lost ."
98146,sw2362,sv,"you ,"
4450,sw2168,sv,"and one thing , it 'll save us money , because we 've got the buildings sitting there ,"
179219,sw2568,sv,"Um , that was okay ,"
13666,sw2368,sv,"well we 're getting off the subject , I guess ,"
53785,sw2155,sv,"You know , maybe you lived too far away to care for them ,"
120924,sw4726,sv,"And so , you know , they , they would just ,"
24967,sw3162,sv,"and some of them do n't ,"
112645,sw2380,sv,it 's not so bad for the court system because the money there is n't being spent
12834,sw2776,sv,It 's something they do n't tell you about when you 're growing up .
201649,sw3140,sv,and if we do n't start making changes in the homes
137973,sw3870,sv,"But , by the same token some of these charges they make for well , minor endeavors , shall we say --"
182095,sw2554,sv,and they 'll try it again in a couple of years .
5931,sw3228,sv,"it 's , it 's a little different , because you see things from a different --"
119126,sw3898,sv,"must have had some interesting , uh , assignments for you there ."
134716,sw2875,sv,"it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again , you know ,"
43867,sw2995,sv,Maybe he drinks

14522,sw2888,sv,That 's all you have time for .
41111,sw2234,sv,"there 's some people are living pretty , pretty good life styles ,"
179973,sw4792,sv,I think that 's probably a good thing .
199578,sw2628,sv,Well you do n't just get ready .
174917,sw3320,sv,and nothing seems to change .
76899,sw3811,sv,"It 's phenomenal , the programming , the human operating system ,"

67329,sw2260,sv,"So . Uh , it 's , I do n't know , an urban area , I guess"

7861,sw2232,sv,I 'd say it is wrong to MUMBLEx

147804,sw4902,sv,"I think that , uh , we simply must start accepting everybody in the world ."

69241,sw2617,sv,"I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with , uh , kind of a different attitude ."
21310,sw4078,sv,"I think you save a lot of the cleaning service 's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to , to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step --"
179866,sw2640,sv,the judge might know
161789,sw2820,sv,"But ,"
131693,sw3535,sv,"uh , even if people have good intentions , I think uh , power corrupts or something to a certain extent , you know ."
107519,sw3596,sv,that 's true .
190848,sw4036,sv,It was a pretty wild experience .
41113,sw2234,sv,"And that 's not fair ,"
83810,sw4376,sv,And they go down the line ten years
89808,sw3081,sv,"-- if you get it on sale ,"
147707,sw4785,sv,"Well , I decided that , you know , you need that once in awhile . That you , you need to plan the quality time"
80264,sw2151,sv,"and they did , do , do do a lot of public service activities ,"
17810,sw3908,sv,People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in .
176150,sw4697,sv,"But I meant for some , when both parties agreed that yes , we 're going to have a judge here ."
91387,sw4159,sv,"So it all comes filtering down to us all in- , individually ."
187880,sw4353,sv,you have to keep up with them .
14869,sw2709,sv,it 's kind of scary because they 're so bright .
163421,sw2909,sv,"and maybe that 's a benefit to everybody , you know ."
196311,sw4333,sv,"And then , of course , the bottom fell out ."
6154,sw2684,sv,"I , I , think , you know , that the whole idea of , uh , the death penalty was invented for two reasons ."
214527,sw2611,sv,"Uh , they 're outrageous !"
196693,sw3133,sv,"gosh I 'm sure , not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas"
74895,sw2160,sv,and they rush to get the same thing .
101062,sw3364,sv,"I never have liked her ,"
12377,sw2594,sv,"But , you know , I think a lot of people , like I said , are more concerned ,"
135186,sw3563,sv,"It seems like Rolando Blackman and , and Harper sort of carry the team ,"
137750,sw3626,sv,"oh gosh , it 's worth your time to just upgrade ,"
141293,sw2221,sv,"serving on the jury would be definitely more respo , you 'd have to be a definitely more responsible person ."
22748,sw2353,sv,"And , and I just sort of think that 's ridiculous ."
28934,sw2834,sv,"I guess we 've gotten more of a ,"
79708,sw2324,sv,"I do n't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the , the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America --"
73869,sw2502,sv,"I mean , you know , I think the people in those country do want our help . The people that are under conditions that are , you know , not favorable to this their rights ."
93,sw3743,sv,"and it really , it 's affecting the families --"
188350,sw2184,sv,and that 's good .
140664,sw4840,sv,"But as far as writing checks out and paying taxes , I think it 's pretty high ."
176149,sw4697,sv,"yes , I would feel , uh , you 're right , that my civil rights had been violated ."
179984,sw4792,sv,quorums are to easy to get .
4539,sw2168,sv,we do not .
108919,sw3194,sv,"I , I know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just , um , get it into different categories like that ,"
81498,sw2434,sv,"And , I think they need that ."
208851,sw3801,sv,"Definitely that area , that , that 's big time ."
168217,sw3068,sv,"I , I think most employers would probably rather hire , you know , a , a three six in , um , in history , uh , to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration ."
139290,sw2630,sv,"and ,"
151044,sw4051,sv,and I know there 's a lot of pollutants we ca n't even see coming out of --
90677,sw4548,sv,-- but I do believe it 's necessary
212241,sw3266,sv,And they 're fun .
13315,sw3500,sv,Most of them do the --
3195,sw2125,sv,"there is , there 's an awful lot of things set up , you know , just any , anything you want to do ."
195386,sw2546,sv,"and the way it is now , it 's not ."
92792,sw4072,sv,"They kept just showing , you know , how great we were doing"
110963,sw3805,sv,"You know , there 's so much --"
70338,sw2792,sv,"It 's terrible ,"
188756,sw4060,sv,"whereas yeah in a smaller ,"
150117,sw2956,sv,"Most people , uh , a great number of people now work at various , at different jobs that , if a third of the people are shift workers , they wo n't be able to get to the , to the polls in any case . If they , uh , have to work late into the evening and not get up ."
191522,sw3445,sv,"It , it really just turned out nicely ."
137953,sw3870,sv,"and the reason is because the market place does n't seem to have performed adequately , uh , the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has , uh , provided some very good health care and , uh , much , I think inadequate health care . Uh ,"
178774,sw3550,sv,"usually , you know something breaks ,"
58259,sw2340,sv,"These people have given so much of their lives , you know , to , to America --"
155659,sw2488,sv,"We 're not going to say we 're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years ,"
27664,sw2723,sv,"you know , it 's a very common thing ."
21263,sw2675,sv,but it 's the best one we 've got .
21118,sw2675,sv,and you just might resemble somebody .
34354,sw3463,sv,or something the way they had the trial
79356,sw3342,sv,"So I think there 's a lot of people that have , you know , really , I guess that you 'd call it really sport fishing ,"
115394,sw3804,sv,everybody likes that .
157257,sw2571,sv,If it was presented to see .
97184,sw3697,sv,but I do n't much think so .
96132,sw3387,sv,"Our , our , our Senate and Congress and , and people that , that deal everyday and , and what 's going to be done with those monies --"
110955,sw3805,sv,"So the more we communicate , hey , look , we want a change here , because , you know , as it turns out , we 've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country ."
157224,sw2571,sv,"and I 'm sure they hit a few every now and then ,"
179691,sw4801,sv,"And it 's like , you know , that 's a big problem"
18589,sw3379,sv,"we always , we think of the K G B and we think such bad things , you know ."
143190,sw2405,sv,"I 'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations , you know ."
21753,sw2437,sv,I think that 's really good .
13857,sw2368,sv,and it 's just a hoot to watch them .
38750,sw2968,sv,"Th- , they , make conclusions in them that may or --"
154110,sw4720,sv,"Oh , and if you try to get it outside of your corporation , you 're going to pay an arm and a leg ."
199723,sw4123,sv,That 's pretty good .
139738,sw2376,sv,That would be much more convenient .
4889,sw2711,sv,"Uh , now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter ,"
27107,sw2821,sv,and I think that that would make them drool any way .
74966,sw2160,sv,"but you wo n't find me dealing in drugs ,"
34626,sw2293,sv,"Everybody loves their car ,"
164278,sw2436,sv,"But again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly , uh , commercials ,"
174928,sw3320,sv,"I do n't think anyone does , in fact ."
166957,sw3041,sv,so that 's kind of a --
107774,sw2992,sv,"So , uh , they had to have picked them up from , uh , the T V ."
12629,sw2594,sv,"I , I think that , I mean , I think that they really are doing a good thing now"
116100,sw2424,sv,"Well , gasoline , especially , in this part of the country we all use it all the time , you know ,"
23271,sw2959,sv,"And , uh , tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them , which is not bad ."
76640,sw2365,sv,"that 's , uh , this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting"
16901,sw3738,sv,"I mean if you look at the , the high unemployment rate right now"
2355,sw4774,sv,"But I , I , I would , I would probably go for , for going ahead and doing it , you know . If it 's got to be done for everyone ."
116590,sw3131,sv,but --
14932,sw2709,sv,And it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools .
70690,sw2460,sv,You ca n't .
17975,sw3282,sv,Then they have to negotiate almost everything
76381,sw3124,sv,"It seemed like , it was almost like you were living on an island"
174605,sw2910,sv,I really think .
55620,sw3518,sv,"but they 'd just have to mail it to you , I suppose , huh ."
149442,sw3343,sv,"Some , I think they more of their parts plastic , which , you know , makes things break easier ,"
119914,sw3926,sv,As long as it 's not used to delay the trial so much .
165660,sw2634,sv,and they 're going to fight with them .
22444,sw3788,sv,and --
154165,sw4720,sv,"Oh , I think , I think it 's just a crying shame , uh ,"
56357,sw3185,sv,It 's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes .
104272,sw4056,sv,It 's bigger than just the benefits part .
155307,sw2488,sv,"I mean , I think they 're doing their duty ,"
35009,sw2957,sv,"That 's interesting ,"
191837,sw4327,sv,"I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from ,"
4767,sw2711,sv,That would have been best time to go .
55316,sw4716,sv,"-- and I think maybe , uh , and that 's the type of , the thing that should be , you know , stressed ."
118332,sw3056,sv,the movie was nothing compared to the book .
112052,sw2989,sv,"and so , uh , it 's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn , you know , that , that they need to learn at the age , you know --"
20196,sw2478,sv,"We , as Americans were n't producing anything ."
133551,sw2755,sv,"And , you know , it 's a shame"
32915,sw3057,sv,"Now , see that is a nice attitude to go into ."
200555,sw4079,sv,and you got to put put stuff in them you know .
186297,sw4153,sv,They did not show them care to these small children who are being left .
180907,sw2667,sv,And it 's not as boring if you get several people --
198989,sw2539,sv,Children are so full of energy .
17998,sw2303,sv,"And I think the other thing is the news me- , media puts such a blitz on it that they we- , had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting , you know ."
78207,sw2609,sv,Maybe it should go with a driver 's license .
78977,sw3450,sv,and you do n't get the soreness .
47796,sw3118,sv,"making it unanimous sometimes might , uh , let , the only thing , it might let more people get off ."
24365,sw3247,sv,"Though I tend to be , we tend to be skeptical ."
50740,sw4681,sv,I think people are getting so fed up with it .
27547,sw2723,sv,"and instead of having a , a socialized pension , it just would be really money that you and your company ,"
88472,sw2039,sv,"It 's a scream ,"
40960,sw3570,sv,"and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more , uh , much better in many ways ."
136966,sw3050,sv,"golf is just ,"
18404,sw4037,sv,I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets --
16808,sw2379,sv,"Well , I 'd , I 'd say actually I mean as someone who 's involved in education I 'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the , role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society ."
70739,sw2460,sv,"It really does n't ,"
20310,sw2478,sv,"I figure well , if they claim that it 's going to cost us eighty-six billion , it 's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes"
159236,sw2526,sv,"Now , see , I would have never figured that , I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that 's limited edition ."
13387,sw2483,sv,You probably have n't either unless you 're a radio buff .
105671,sw2962,sv,"But I , I would think I , if I did anything , I would protect the juror from , from any sort of an inquisition after ."
126997,sw2952,sv,"So , I think that will be a lot of fun ."
21059,sw2675,sv,So many of us have led sheltered lives --
92933,sw2598,sv,"it was ,"
106131,sw2806,sv,"You know it 's funny how pets get to be so , uh ,"
213545,sw4175,sv,"well , I mean ,"
154483,sw2603,sv,"Then that would ,"
163385,sw2909,sv,"-- and I think that was just an attempt that , that Fidel Castro to undermine , you know --"
151570,sw3398,sv,"and it 's a lot of work , owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it ."
65373,sw2533,sv,"and a lot times people think , oh , well , I 'm not blessed"
184557,sw4346,sv,good teachers
110348,sw3449,sv,I guess when the veterans went to Washington --
50592,sw3151,sv,a lot of them .
58207,sw2340,sv,"-- you ca n't take care of them ,"
133736,sw2235,sv,"I mean , it does n't work , I mean ."
63916,sw2177,sv,that looks good .
25440,sw2495,sv,"I , I do n't know if you get into the mind set where you just say , Well , I 'll accept something , or you just really have to get on their back , I mean ,"
91841,sw3148,sv,"It 's just , you know , a possible solution --"
24354,sw3247,sv,"they do not have it in Europe , as I understand ."
15930,sw2953,sv,they would understand more .
147934,sw3636,sv,Nice and quick and easy to put up .
168491,sw2826,sv,"but whether they 're soon enough and fast enough I do n't know ,"
113676,sw2847,sv,"I , I seem to remember that , uh , little byline on a lot of things I 've read ."
57318,sw2237,sv,They 're beautiful .
123939,sw3065,sv,But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for --
520,sw2278,sv,"Well , the way I , the way I see it , is ,"
132414,sw2663,sv,"I think if the President can prove that he 's popular , you know , that he can do the job --"
34315,sw2190,sv,"on air pollution I , I , I do n't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really ."
89583,sw3728,sv,"Well , we have to keep talking , I guess ."
63607,sw3523,sv,It increases each year I think .
108770,sw2515,sv,"So , we got into it fairly cheaply ,"
128042,sw3556,sv,"He deserves it ,"
18192,sw2303,sv,but I suspect it would work .
188743,sw4060,sv,"I think probably in a small ,"
78369,sw3551,sv,so I probably ca n't .
204749,sw2749,sv,"it 's , it 's sad , though , that , uh , that the people , though , that"
185455,sw4360,sv,"Uh , the parents usually took out time , uh , you know , more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity ."
211188,sw3821,sv,that 's unbelievable .
73932,sw2502,sv,"I , I agree that , that the communication that now , that communication has ,"
58948,sw3121,sv,"and even , you know , people are , seem to , a lot of people seem to be engaged for a long time before they get married --"
210465,sw3304,sv,Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea .
19037,sw2543,sv,"But , you know , if you go two or three years without having that ,"
40105,sw3280,sv,"and with interest , you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different ."
44705,sw4655,sv,"But , uh , uh , so I think nursing homes are , have changed ."
177388,sw2062,sv,"If you never see it you do n't spend it ,"
190497,sw4318,sv,Which is a good deal .
67800,sw3458,sv,but it just has n't been what I thought it would be .
106477,sw3675,sv,"We 're fortunate that way , that I make enough to do what we want to do ."
95027,sw2435,sv,"and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both , you know , because I think , or directing job ."
50835,sw4735,sv,"so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled ,"
110580,sw2849,sv,"And , and so often when you , when you bring in the advantages , the resources and so forth , there , there is a trade ."
83420,sw4725,sv,"every one of us , most of us have our , have all four feet in the trough , you know . Plus our snout , right up to our ears ."
50659,sw4681,sv,"so they , they think well I 'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat"
142870,sw3515,sv,"You know , if it 's free , people will use it ,"
91623,sw2285,sv,"These people , you know , they bring their , their Johns home"
50392,sw3151,sv,"They , they call it an invasion of privacy ."
35919,sw2689,sv,So it 's pretty scary .
23007,sw2621,sv,they really do .
18009,sw2303,sv,"and , you know , if I , if we help elect a president who 's going to save us , then , then the whole country will be saved ."
21157,sw2675,sv,"Well , it 's not , the , uh , uh , it 's not the best system ,"
135401,sw2661,sv,That sound good .
70034,sw2486,sv,"because when you do have to be in front of people ,"
55758,sw2983,sv,"And there are some really , really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models ."
153028,sw4784,sv,"Uh , people are , uh , reluctant to pass , uh , school tax levies even , uh , when the money is needed or would be well spent because it 's , uh , they do n't have kids in the schools ."
104414,sw4723,sv,"I find that , uh , that the Corvettes are , are becoming really , really nice cars ."
177249,sw3168,sv,"but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , it 's kind of like what they keep talking about the , uh , the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things --"
147172,sw2490,sv,"If the gun shop owner does it ,"
197364,sw3467,sv,"It , they are just gems of shows ."
122648,sw4752,sv,"and they would not do these bad things , you know ."
17787,sw3908,sv,So they have one and three quarters jobs now . Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter .
1112,sw2040,sv,"but I 'm troubled by too close a clinging to , to the past"
108924,sw3194,sv,"It 's , yeah , it 's not a big deal ."
55750,sw2983,sv,"Oh , he 's interesting ."
121804,sw2452,sv,"I would think so ,"
80449,sw2461,sv,if it works at colleges it will work down below .
22888,sw2621,sv,they had such a super team .
69262,sw2617,sv,"But , uh , I do think we learned ."
44067,sw2955,sv,"Uh , monetarily too , I just do not think we have done enough for the , uh , Vietnamese people as a whole . Uh , in South Vietnam , in general , in helping them restore themselves ."
14642,sw2342,sv,"They may , you know , may be better if they give up just a little bit to settle things down ."
194536,sw4619,sv,"but it , it seems nice enough ."
57980,sw3414,sv,"So they must be collecting information about who does it , and how often ."
34377,sw3463,sv,you go through college
40653,sw3847,sv,"Um , those are nice ."
202853,sw2429,sv,"Well , um , I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party ."
106351,sw2806,sv,"But i- , it 's , it was interesting ."
137960,sw3870,sv,and it 's going to be a difficult transition .
167139,sw3041,sv,"and , um , you know , when the truth , oh , well ,"
74077,sw2502,sv,I mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all
24383,sw3247,sv,I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States .
198604,sw2061,sv,Since I imagine it 's fairly competitive .
156195,sw4013,sv,and it does begin with the families at home --
153066,sw4784,sv,"But , uh , the , uh , uh , now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is , uh , an economic enterprise to train people for jobs ."
51390,sw2610,sv,"I think the other thing that 's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we have n't ,"
114393,sw2431,sv,I do n't think they should do away with the seat belts now .
155592,sw2488,sv,It 's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids
190748,sw3658,sv,"It 's getting to a point that you have to have it ,"
1498,sw2325,sv,But it really gets down to the particular teacher .
189136,sw4329,sv,"they , they really do n't ,"
120949,sw4726,sv,"the way kids , the way kids are , you know , I mean , they can , you know ."
127810,sw4927,sv,"So , mostly , it 's just kind of one of those things that goes away ."
56347,sw3185,sv,"He , he always did such a good job , I thought ."
28498,sw2924,sv,"there are two people who say well he just looks guilty , um ."
120518,sw3143,sv,it 's pretty scary .
17833,sw3908,sv,It puts them in a very bad situation .
56316,sw3185,sv,"But then we started thinking , especially in Plano , the weather is so hot in August , that there really is n't a lot the children can do outside anyhow ."
172938,sw2525,sv,Especially if they 're found guilty of the crime .
144663,sw3082,sv,Probably lots of laughs .
205304,sw3476,sv,that would force everybody to use it . Or to quit selling tape measures in inches .
167481,sw2469,sv,"even , even a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something ."
31143,sw2754,sv,and that would be pushing it .
162167,sw2897,sv,So maybe that covers the topic then .
45866,sw2662,sv,he 's very good .
139623,sw3087,sv,That 's kind --
214366,sw3887,sv,"and in this country , uh , the , the solution that , that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable ."
20030,sw3054,sv,That is a really pretty state park .
149393,sw3343,sv,"I , you , I think there 's , there can be a lemon in anything --"
86900,sw3150,sv,"but uh , you know , but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gon na be , you know"
45688,sw4615,sv,You always find something a little extra that you 'd like to get that month
76981,sw4174,sv,"Well , that 's , that 's one of the , really , a valid point that people need --"
170284,sw3655,sv,That 's for sure .
171334,sw2439,sv,"Well , you can reduce that risk by , uh , having the car checked out ,"
45982,sw2662,sv,"I , I , it 's a little far fetched to ,"
156484,sw3375,sv,"Then if you do n't have qualified teachers in the different MUMBLEx ,"
128058,sw3556,sv,but --
136971,sw3050,sv,"either , um , either you have not played it , or , or you , you have played it"
111319,sw3651,sv,"It 's , it 's also a way of relieving stress ."
203026,sw2429,sv,It can it can be fun I if you have the time
196218,sw2775,sv,So you 're just the opposite from me .
192317,sw4316,sv,I guess it could be worse .
85987,sw2421,sv,but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want .
165517,sw2717,sv,"And , and that way we can be sure , you know ,"
189732,sw4340,sv,"-- you know , I mean , it is a rather final solution , though ."
27339,sw3271,sv,but you know I guess you 'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough .
23933,sw3769,sv,"and , you know , you just are tempted to give in to that ,"
25836,sw2898,sv,"because , uh , you know , not everybody plays of course , but they 're still ,"
194330,sw2451,sv,"That 's probably more true than ,"
41936,sw3454,sv,"that 's , that 's a , that 's a tricky one ."
45077,sw2323,sv,But that same person also has a family
168481,sw2826,sv,"so it 's , it 's not always the school 's systems"
162849,sw2921,sv,"you can have them in ,"
80246,sw2151,sv,"Well , I , I think it 's a pretty good idea ."
150877,sw3207,sv,"And so it 's a , it 's kind of a depressing topic though ."
93842,sw3023,sv,And the sacrifice is not that great .
174910,sw3320,sv,"And all these politicians make , make hay over , you know --"
26788,sw2064,sv,And you wonder why they ca n't just stop it .
151524,sw3047,sv,Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
159785,sw2504,sv,I mean it 's like they 're turned off on voting .
194321,sw2451,sv,"I think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him look , look worse that what his , um , what his ideals are ,"
90704,sw4548,sv,"I 'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and , uh , that , uh , uh ,"
154375,sw2603,sv,"And it 's , uh , oh , it 's just , I do n't know , it 's , it 's a total free relaxation ."
177521,sw2062,sv,"Well , I could certainly , personally stand seeing them go to a , a standardized compensatory time --"
73886,sw2502,sv,"we , we fall out of , uh , agreements with certain leaders"
106693,sw2024,sv,"that 's , that 's alwa- , well , that 's kind of a hobby"
195692,sw4320,sv,"and , uh , I think , uh , to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised ."
157193,sw2571,sv,there would probably be very few exceptions to that
2836,sw2038,sv,"In reality , I think , what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves ,"
68376,sw3333,sv,they just ca n't do it .
120341,sw4707,sv,Still 's that way to some extent .
132374,sw2663,sv,"He , he , you know , we know he 's a good leader ,"
149030,sw3983,sv,Every once in a while they come in handy .
110774,sw3190,sv,I bet .
204755,sw2749,sv,because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want .
44679,sw4655,sv,and I think there has been definite changes of nursing homes
64986,sw3406,sv,"Hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit ,"
108602,sw3359,sv,"Things that are kind of oddball , like , uh , Thai cuisine ,"
112905,sw2579,sv,"Well , the , one thing 's for sure we can always discuss the weather ,"
36232,sw2389,sv,because they do n't have the family roots anymore .
149601,sw2067,sv,"it does because you 're , you know , you , you 're , you know , you 're just co , costing yourself more money because you , if you ca n't make the monthly , the minimum payment , you 're paying interest ,"
54615,sw2879,sv,"I think everyone would ,"
30828,sw2794,sv,That 's a real neat idea .
109621,sw2300,sv,"It 's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semi-conductor firm ,"
46516,sw3747,sv,"well there are some of the few organizations that have the funds to , uh , you know , do like big big works . Uh ,"
185367,sw4108,sv,"I think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to ,"
59891,sw2418,sv,it is tough .
179811,sw2640,sv,And that 's not going to be good .
104118,sw3049,sv,"Even when he 's sad , you know , you great faith that he will get happy again ."
141399,sw2025,sv,"but , seems like the jury system does have it 's advantages ."
69692,sw3111,sv,"uh , so it 's effected all of us ."
23481,sw2959,sv,I think so .
16900,sw3738,sv,"There probably needs to be some training on how to , to , to adjust to these changes as they come about ."
196586,sw3133,sv,"and , uh , it gives you a little bit , uh , more a glimpse of the , the real world"
99085,sw2094,sv,"they , uh , really listen to"
108294,sw3537,sv,"I mean , as sorrowful as it is . Uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled from his license ,"
106967,sw3072,sv,"but it 's , it was really fun ."
149029,sw3983,sv,but they have been nice to have around .
177664,sw4826,sv,"Uh , and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done --"
199087,sw2539,sv,"Well , that , that 's , uh , is an advantage of being in the education field ."
91599,sw2285,sv,"it 's not , they do n't care about anybody --"
32001,sw2205,sv,"That 's , that 's what the T V stations do ."
173621,sw4113,sv,"Uh , the other , the other thing that , uh , bothers me about our system is just that , uh , in , for , for , in , in , in Congress the amount of power any , any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they 've been there"
168468,sw2826,sv,"You can as a teacher , ca n't hold a child accountable ,"
177339,sw2062,sv,"It 's just a , it 's just a miracle that how fast that adds up , you know ."
105376,sw3012,sv,"You know , they teach their children , uh , in such a way that ,"
129789,sw2736,sv,"once you realize how much money you 've got to spend , then you start looking around at , at what you can buy with it , where before I think you , you looked at the car you wanted ,"
210227,sw2370,sv,"They just , you know , just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down , and in a while get around to it ."
155669,sw2488,sv,"I think it would be worth it everybody wo- ,"
162076,sw3533,sv,and you seem to be making out all right .
157367,sw2407,sv,and I would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases .
160459,sw2427,sv,"they , they do ."
112518,sw3011,sv,it 's sort of unusual really .
176867,sw2998,sv,"but , uh , in terms of demanding , it 's just not caused"
91645,sw2285,sv,"or , you know , because it , they ca n't remove themselves ,"
179481,sw3015,sv,"Uh , national health insurance , I think , is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive ."
185217,sw4628,sv,"And , on a , a scale , I guess it 's still considered small ."
133524,sw2755,sv,"And , and that 's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself"
16894,sw3738,sv,"But I believe that , uh , an individual should really learn how to , to learn --"
46822,sw2552,sv,what a coincidence .
177778,sw4608,sv,it almost seems like they 're getting quite a bit smarter .
151335,sw3047,sv,"So , uh , you know , you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do ."
76270,sw3124,sv,"Normally we do n't have too much , uh , humidity or , or , uh , rainy time when it 's past June ."
213498,sw4175,sv,"Paper does n't seem threatening at all , you know ."
87483,sw3130,sv,That 's a lot of fun .
112689,sw2380,sv,"but , the likelihood certainly tilts it ."
153626,sw3541,sv,"They 're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around ,"
196446,sw2095,sv,"I mean you can only talk about , about the situation just so long ."
209740,sw2305,sv,"and it ,"
157857,sw2442,sv,"And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like , Well I 've done a good job because I got , worked myself to that point ."
53891,sw2155,sv,"and they just do , they do n't care as much ."
79849,sw4796,sv,"Uh , I suspect a lot of people , uh , uh , got , uh , turned on by watching , watching those go off ."
106805,sw2450,sv,"But , the , uh ,"
184657,sw4346,sv,they have to have guidance
185873,sw2945,sv,They really grow up quick . Especially at that early age .
104280,sw4056,sv,It 's kind of an interesting plan .
201650,sw3140,sv,and maybe part of that is educating parents better .
196934,sw4096,sv,"well , real interesting ."
5047,sw4799,sv,"that , you know , they say putting them out to pasture"
108513,sw3359,sv,but --
193012,sw3435,sv,That 's good .
46375,sw2413,sv,"they really make themselves look bad ,"
78220,sw2609,sv,"But actually it 's a privilege ,"
165652,sw2634,sv,That applies to anything as well as guns .
104408,sw4723,sv,"you know , it 's just necessary ."
208164,sw2759,sv,"And they are , those are expensive tests ."
172655,sw3085,sv,"but they 're going to learn it sometime ,"
123390,sw2482,sv,"Fathers do n't even like malls ,"
37672,sw3346,sv,but there 's a lot of other public service things --
107389,sw3381,sv,"I guess that 's another thing that to me is a , a real problem ,"
186760,sw4321,sv,"And , you know , they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this ,"
160032,sw2427,sv,"it just takes up , you know , like you say , a lot of your garden area ."
81787,sw2441,sv,You have to .
157459,sw2407,sv,You would have expected them to be the last ones to .
116370,sw2287,sv,"I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days , or you could mail it in , or something like , if you have , if you have real strict work hours , and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long --"
206210,sw3411,sv,"and I think a lot of , a lot of car manufacturers do n't really keep that into consider- , do n't take that into consideration --"
9487,sw3597,sv,"I think one of the thing that I notice a lot ,"
87922,sw2163,sv,"It 's one we all hold dear and near , I 'm sure ."
193847,sw4038,sv,"and I think part of it was they did n't , uh , they did n't like the fact that I do n't drink any more ."
201588,sw3140,sv,"It 's already ,"
108557,sw3359,sv,"seafood seems to be a lit , a little bit more expensive than , than other types of food ."
78368,sw3551,sv,"Obviously nobody 's smart enough to have figured it out yet ,"
15359,sw2707,sv,You 'll see that on the evening news .
133155,sw2301,sv,"It 's just , you know , too easy to do ."
162852,sw2921,sv,"You have more of a choice ,"
195672,sw4320,sv,and that 's what 's causing all the killing .
123976,sw3065,sv,"I mean , everything seems to be based on the same thing ."
76081,sw2334,sv,I mean --
137440,sw3591,sv,I think they would have to have some training .
168683,sw2650,sv,"Well , they 're companions ,"
80961,sw2121,sv,"well you might , uh , generate some --"
19460,sw2355,sv,"and it seems like everything is raising , every- , everything that can be , cigarettes ,"
123674,sw3092,sv,Eye care is good .
168334,sw3068,sv,"I , I guess another thing that concerns me is , uh , so many people , it seems like everybody today is still in that MUMBLEx job market"
74082,sw2502,sv,"and it 's like well , you know , they 're educating their people to higher degrees than we do ."
90883,sw2252,sv,"that 's very interesting , never thought of that ."
39786,sw3250,sv,"They seem just to be so chocked full of , of ads ."
153067,sw4784,sv,"And , uh , I 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is ."
150863,sw3207,sv,but --
167069,sw3041,sv,"because they made a big deal about how this , this film was such a big leap for the , the people who , who were the ancestors of the , this Indian tribe"
129380,sw2926,sv,"well that 's what I was going to point out , I think it mostly is that technical ,"
106790,sw2450,sv,"I thought , uh , I thought ,"
187350,sw4152,sv,That ca n't be good for Los Angeles either .
149057,sw3983,sv,after a while --
212489,sw3080,sv,something else has to go away --
60163,sw2773,sv,"and then I do n't think we projected what was going to happen after the war ,"
200337,sw4019,sv,You would n't want him to carry her off or something .
17467,sw3042,sv,That 's a little early .
82062,sw2441,sv,"You know . And they only did it because they , I guess they were embarrassed --"
86790,sw2302,sv,"that was sort of the beginning of , Ye shall be treated fairly ."
159601,sw2466,sv,it 's pretty tough to keep up with .
54889,sw2175,sv,"it 's so , it would be really hard now to have twelve children ."
173372,sw3354,sv,"kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds ,"
114628,sw3573,sv,"-- and very , very comfortable car ."
72226,sw2840,sv,they got thrown right into the total mainstream --
152678,sw3524,sv,"-- those are the two that can , that , that have the wherewithal"
189143,sw4329,sv,"it 's not as easy ,"
82004,sw2441,sv,"They do an absolutely necessary job ,"
8505,sw2528,sv,"I just thought they had some ,"
59959,sw2418,sv,"I think , uh , that that is a tough , uh ,"
9410,sw2871,sv,"You expect more out of , uh , Julia Roberts , though ."
10083,sw2716,sv,"I mean everywhere you , you look , you are getting something new ."
112766,sw2380,sv,"They are n't testifying really in their own words ,"
193250,sw3156,sv,"If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass ,"
91405,sw4159,sv,"and that can be part of continuing education , maybe for judges ."
48671,sw2149,sv,Substitute .
169375,sw3099,sv,"That 's , that 's wonderful for the child ."
79044,sw2835,sv,"Uh , I 'm not sure in the last ten years it 's been very different from before ."
21092,sw2675,sv,"But then again , so many times you get one or two holdouts ,"
191838,sw4327,sv,"Well , you know , uh , talking about the lawyers , you know what might very well do , uh , cause a , uh , a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases ."
111342,sw3651,sv,"And it , that 's works well because you can design it to , to suit whatever equipment you have"
177830,sw4608,sv,"it 's against the law to do a lot of things , you know ."
126412,sw3828,sv,"Well , I think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the , or a lot less of the ,"
38070,sw2426,sv,"we 're , we 're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out ."
183554,sw4158,sv,"and I think that , um , they might , you know , pay for that ."
133753,sw2235,sv,but it would be come back .
211760,sw3113,sv,"but , to me , when you do the crime , then you should pay for whatever you did ,"
22441,sw3788,sv,and --
168517,sw2826,sv,"some ways it 's rather frightening ,"
171317,sw2439,sv,the price already drops in half .
69591,sw3569,sv,"they , they get what they hear from ,"
116197,sw2424,sv,"I mean , you think about it now ,"
200877,sw3441,sv,"and you 've got , uh , all kinds of people knocking on your door and , who want to , uh , either direct you to the right path or , or want to , uh , sell you , uh , paper routes , uh , whatever ,"
1058,sw2040,sv,"Uh , I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now ."
168519,sw2826,sv,"it 's just , it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think ,"
183842,sw4334,sv,"But , uh , it 's getting , uh , uh , getting pretty big everywhere , as I see it ."
102045,sw3245,sv,-- you 've got to have something to --
112744,sw2380,sv,"and , you know , they just have n't done a real complete case here to my thinking ."
149107,sw3309,sv,"but , it could be put to more practical use ."
71876,sw2858,sv,"but , I think that 's for the , the few and far between ."
145959,sw2253,sv,"well , it was a political move ."
95144,sw2435,sv,You really truly do .
44027,sw2955,sv,it just kind of --
60691,sw2433,sv,"I mean , and I just do n't think it 's healthy"
108925,sw3194,sv,You get used to it .
147495,sw2490,sv,"and , and most people that , uh , break in or whatever , go to houses without the dogs ,"
90724,sw2252,sv,"It 's , it 's hard to , to know anymore if it 's a , a threat one way or another because , uh , it used to be s- , so , f- , much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell , you know , rank and file in behind it ."
31400,sw3203,sv,"For that reason it can stay the same ,"
50765,sw4681,sv,"And maybe that 's going to happen to America where they 'll say , hey"
160776,sw2262,sv,"And I figure we 're paying to take care of this toxic waste , no matter who does it ."
69485,sw3229,sv,"It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am ,"
153347,sw3688,sv,"But , uh , i- , it 's worth it once you get it ."
128629,sw2622,sv,"They do forget , it 's true , coul , because everybody ,"
182235,sw2554,sv,"we 're , we 've already been overtaken ,"
93191,sw2828,sv,And then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents .
28638,sw2924,sv,"and I 'm sure that , that , that there are some reasons for good ."
63185,sw2545,sv,"but , um , unless it is , I guess it 's kind of a waste ."
65559,sw2010,sv,"He wanted to direct it ,"
20311,sw2478,sv,"and so if that 's true , it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was , that went down the tube somewhere ."
143113,sw2405,sv,"and that was it ,"
153722,sw2005,sv,"Of course , you know , there 's not one on every corner ,"
160867,sw2262,sv,"You have grandchildren ,"
195507,sw4109,sv,but Sunday you 're getting ready for Monday .
179854,sw2640,sv,"but it 's not just , you know , horrible ,"
75713,sw3574,sv,but --
53584,sw3216,sv,"the population in those schools are , are , typically , uh , people that very much value the education and support --"
194338,sw2451,sv,"I mean , you ca n't change things overnight ."
36325,sw2389,sv,"A man can afford the necessities , a woman affords the luxuries ."
209619,sw2305,sv,"I , I , I think , uh , law would be a fine field , a fine profession , fine field to go into ."
99471,sw3850,sv,it was .
6265,sw2684,sv,"you 're , you 're really performing a , a benefit to society --"
43349,sw2767,sv,"I mean I think that would be , it would , it would strike one as strange if there 's no reason for --"
26015,sw2967,sv,"and I think that is , that is the point ."
22005,sw3255,sv,"-- uh , the other thing when you 're talking about freon with cars , uh , air conditioning , I 'm sure --"
41421,sw3204,sv,"And , uh , and I , that 's hard to be a caretaker I really believe ."
195375,sw2546,sv,"I think that 's what aggravates a lot of people , is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty ,"
5520,sw2944,sv,"if they 're going to do random , um ,"
212667,sw2018,sv,It 's kind of an easy thing to talk about .

19449,sw2355,sv,"that 's also a good reason why it , it ,"
28887,sw2834,sv,"they , they hurt themselves a little bit in that way ."
150329,sw2956,sv,because all the eligible --
83789,sw4698,sv,"the old-timers , even the people who are technologists do n't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot"
51248,sw2576,sv,"the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular T V programming and watch a lot of other , a variety of programs out there , as well as use of the V C R --"
131784,sw3535,sv,"I do n't think that they , anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government ."
105501,sw3355,sv,"but we have a , a marvelous band instructor ,"
96289,sw4138,sv,"And progressive tax , I think , uh , does not give people incentive to make more money ,"
105720,sw2962,sv,or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it .
204530,sw3174,sv,"and , and it would be , uh , you know , out of the question ."
88850,sw3159,sv,And then every so often you weed through them
62325,sw2051,sv,"because , uh , most likely that will happen , wo n't it , that , you know ,"
186733,sw4321,sv,"Well , I mean , I think ,"
120503,sw3143,sv,"I think they have them in Dallas because I hear them talking about in the schools , different things happening ,"
70044,sw2486,sv,well jeans are n't exactly professional
10112,sw2768,sv,"I think that 's one thing that I would look at if I was putting my grandmother or my mother , uh , in some sort of home ."
61239,sw2124,sv,"um , that 's what I want ."
26729,sw2064,sv,"If you , if you had to chose , I guess I would , I am sure I would take the lethal injection ."
28075,sw3665,sv,I thought that was wonderful .
143764,sw2157,sv,"at the end of the season , the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt , because , uh , Laufenberg just could n't ever really get it together at all ."
137502,sw2585,sv,"You know , you 're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever ."
45530,sw3946,sv,Because it is a difficult situation
198237,sw3083,sv,"if you do n't care about property and people , you know , you 're not going to care about , uh , about learning , I think ."
48850,sw2149,sv,They 're not worth it .
185044,sw4312,sv,"You hear the same , same tune over and over again --"
65120,sw2533,sv,MUMBLEx that must have been hard on him because he 's just a person
155791,sw2349,sv,"and I 'm not sure that tho- , those programs are available to do that ."
119158,sw3898,sv,"but , uh , it 's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals ."
87309,sw3130,sv,it really is .
183701,sw4380,sv,"now I think maybe it 's started changing in the past few years because , uh , they have of these , uh , sort of mandatory , -tory tests if you have to take before you get --"
155692,sw2349,sv,and there will be a lot of rebellion in that
178926,sw3382,sv,it 's hard to imagine what life was like without it now .
113896,sw2847,sv,"and ,"
76909,sw4174,sv,"it 's whether or not you 're a resident for that jurisdiction ,"
42767,sw2839,sv,-- but they do n't .
118095,sw2575,sv,"and the , you know , the thought that I , I see the , uh , the mall rats , you know , walking around the mall , nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long , when they could be doing something to help someone ."
138019,sw3870,sv,Government is going to have to change in this regard .
129462,sw2926,sv,"I think it 's , it 's probably the work that your , your children , your children are doing , uh , um ,"
36258,sw2389,sv,There is no need to have children if you do n't want them .
185237,sw4628,sv,"So it 's very much the same kind of place and , uh --"
195057,sw4181,sv,So that 's not too bad .
181651,sw2896,sv,"Because you might find that it 's beyond , uh , what you 're willing to put into it ."
47611,sw2774,sv,"Kind of depends on the quality of carpet , I suppose ,"
146839,sw3303,sv,It 's like last season was so long ago
102820,sw2102,sv,"and it was very , very funny ."
143278,sw3491,sv,"But I think the script was , you know , just incredible compared to the last one ."
49223,sw2228,sv,but I think there are some regular banks that will go down with it .
94252,sw2602,sv,"It all boils down to , whether it 's our side , their side ,"
122928,sw2647,sv,"but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of , sort of thing ."
162505,sw3662,sv,"if it 's a policeman and he 's working with , uh , the public and he has a , and has a gun in his holster or , or even , you know , if it 's a guy at McDonald 's cooking a burger , I think , they 're dangerous in either situation ."
176092,sw3246,sv,you always hear how good .
147084,sw3103,sv,"They are , they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower ."
5330,sw2981,sv,"But over here , where we 're promised the civil liberties of purs- , life , liberty and pursuit of happiness , then taking that away is a , a heinous act ."
135685,sw2586,sv,"It 's , it 's a total experience , you know , getting out in nature and ,"
22075,sw2960,sv,It can be very --
81269,sw2836,sv,but it does n't really feel like you 're in the country .
28063,sw3665,sv,"and it had such a good story , too ."
159890,sw2504,sv,"If they really wanted to vote Republican , they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat ."
103215,sw2197,sv,"and they have their own quirks and tolerances and ,"
121880,sw2452,sv,"I think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is Jordan 's King Hussein because he really kind of ,"
47746,sw3457,sv,"and you , you know , you just oh , it 's , it 's , kind of an eye-opener ."
69907,sw3539,sv,I do n't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere .
195526,sw4109,sv,"One , one of the problems they 're facing now , a lot of people now , is that the health insurance is that the small business ca n't , ca n't offer health insurance --"
167368,sw2469,sv,it 's the hard work .
199412,sw2628,sv,"I mean , they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby ,"
190570,sw4148,sv,"-- and in fact , I 'm not sure that that 's any more , uh , liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than , than anything else ."
103126,sw2197,sv,"it may be good for someone who already has self discipline , who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own ,"
192417,sw4316,sv,"Those are funny labels , see ."
82563,sw2131,sv,"I think , I think they 're a bit over exposed ."
212833,sw2018,sv,"Well I think we 've really come a long way in that because ,"
155648,sw2488,sv,"and they do n't seem to ,"
98548,sw3088,sv,"-- and I think that 's the only reason I have a problem with it , when there 's no , you know , there 's no reason --"
160397,sw2427,sv,"and , and ,"
86846,sw3150,sv,"We 'll have some interesting discussion , I guess ."
28842,sw2834,sv,but I really do think that women have made a contribution --
156026,sw3487,sv,"if , if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the , they were unused to their , that , the way they run things ,"
5410,sw2944,sv,"I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is , is , uh --"
10958,sw3985,sv,"I do n't think anyb- , any --"
44260,sw3703,sv,"Well , there 's a zillion of them ."
159181,sw2526,sv,"I think ,"
143018,sw2405,sv,"It 's just a matter of , like you say , are the advantages , does it justify the cost , if you 're using it strictly for personal business ."
47305,sw2830,sv,and then man she 's really porked out again I guess
83832,sw4376,sv,"if you do n't terminate him , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person ."
31876,sw2205,sv,and that 's why it 's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions .
112764,sw2380,sv,"it 's really kind of , uh , choreographed ."
24506,sw3231,sv,"well , it 's amazing ,"
163645,sw4858,sv,"and actually when you think back on the big events of the war , it was , uh , it was almost a personal struggle among these three , uh ,"
57461,sw3855,sv,I mean it 's just a precaution for everybody .
163298,sw2842,sv,"but there 's no thinking involved , no motion , you know ,"
164331,sw2436,sv,no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it .
98825,sw2275,sv,same thing .
128900,sw3429,sv,"Maybe a people are a little o- , more open-minded than maybe they used to be ."
62035,sw2597,sv,"but really we did n't think about the people that he was going , tr- ,"
43646,sw2263,sv,"It 's just , so , it 's a lot of work , too --"
4982,sw4799,sv,It is expensive .
36322,sw2389,sv,But then it got to be a point where they got some independence .
42684,sw2839,sv,"They , they 've given that away for fifty years ."
6035,sw3265,sv,"If you can find one that 's r- , uh , you know , reliable ."
80319,sw2151,sv,"uh , I 'm not , I 'm not so sure that overseas help , helping overseas would be such a hot idea for , for , uh , a lot of young k- , people ."
132972,sw3095,sv,"And it seems as though we are , uh , giving the criminal the benefit , more than the victim ."
105309,sw3012,sv,"they , they understand violence ."
28661,sw2924,sv,"we- , you 'll help out a little bit ."
179878,sw2640,sv,"obviously what we are doing is not working , you know ."
196208,sw2775,sv,It wo n't hurt them .
116465,sw2287,sv,you 'd really open a can of worms .
187593,sw3135,sv,"but they were so , seemed ,"
156497,sw3375,sv,And that causes a lot of trouble .
106115,sw2806,sv,"And I think that 's true ,"
93368,sw2120,sv,"so many , uh , women are heads of state"
208511,sw3763,sv,And I think this is absolutely ridiculous .
194346,sw2451,sv,"but you know , that 's , that 's what happens when , you know , the cork blows"
10895,sw3985,sv,"it 's been my experience , most people want , uh , to feel like they 're participating in something that , uh , that is not a drudgery , you know , that they --"
65872,sw4023,sv,I do n't think it 's as bad as L A either .
44599,sw2950,sv,"But you , you know , it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot ."
59306,sw3107,sv,"and , and the added costs get passed on to you ,"
140706,sw4840,sv,"But you 'd think that we 're still in , that"
147146,sw2490,sv,"But , I guess I believe , I think the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way . You know ,"
151926,sw2012,sv,"ev- , more harmed or something ."
155693,sw2349,sv,"and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place ,"
90887,sw2252,sv,"you know , in , in the , in , you know , I hope that what 's happening is exactly the way it appears ."
114261,sw2431,sv,"but you know , I like to know more , I mean , hear about more people that have things like that you know ?"
62674,sw2499,sv,Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film .
55150,sw3624,sv,"and ,"
60165,sw2773,sv,"It got over so fast ,"
105504,sw3355,sv,our junior high band is just wonderful .
206832,sw4519,sv,That is a hugh difference .
9918,sw2716,sv,"Everybody makes mistakes , unfortunately ."
46711,sw3064,sv,"Now , those are very handy --"
173503,sw3275,sv,"Of course , we would n't have the retail market we have either"
22809,sw2621,sv,he 'd be good at it .
165752,sw2634,sv,"And all these people come around ,"
82666,sw2131,sv,"And the ones you buy ,"
165792,sw2634,sv,"the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying , well , I 'm going to mug this guy right here"
67051,sw4022,sv,"and we 're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of , you know --"
91918,sw2566,sv,It 's hard to find people like that .
71091,sw4184,sv,"Well , the --"
22797,sw2621,sv,"It was n't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys , I 'll tell you ."
191606,sw4336,sv,"So it 's not really lucrative to take chances like that , you know , even though it , it does exist ."
56011,sw2994,sv,that would be a real good motivation for people .
128689,sw2622,sv,tough topic
29067,sw2834,sv,and she does n't know who she is
100939,sw3364,sv,it 's a good show .
117772,sw2514,sv,"Which I do n't think we are loaning anymore now ,"
18661,sw4703,sv,"Uh , so , you know , they kind of have gotten into the idea that let 's drug test them and let 's put them through rehab ."
150284,sw2956,sv,And maybe
30910,sw2794,sv,"I mean , they tax American imports quite heavily ."
153017,sw4784,sv,"and , and you can influence the way things are ."
6112,sw2684,sv,It does n't do anyone any good .
48079,sw2744,sv,"I mean that 's the point we all should be at , is like finding some solution ,"
199490,sw2628,sv,"I guess it 's always not , not being able to picture one more ,"
183299,sw4133,sv,"but , you know , you know , I think , you know , the , the price , you know ,"
59546,sw3723,sv,"and there was a point to it ,"
20188,sw2478,sv,but there 's got to be some control
151732,sw2589,sv,"they were great men ,"
71850,sw2858,sv,"And not a , and not a very good one at that ."
162563,sw3662,sv,"So , and that cost us , the country , you know , billions of dollars ."
162311,sw3175,sv,"I mean , you can look businesslike in , in a pant- , the same pant suit you would , you know --"
159189,sw2526,sv,"anyway it 's the only car that says , you know , sporty and class , uh ,"
129428,sw2926,sv,I mean that 's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube .
167706,sw2615,sv,"when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much , you know , trouble . Because the three fifty with all the , you know ,"
44012,sw2955,sv,"The only difference was that the government said , okay"
153428,sw2669,sv,"The , uh , I think maybe there 's where the problem came in , you know ."
111436,sw3097,sv,Everything has changed .
176686,sw2510,sv,but they 're going to do it anyway because they know they 're not supposed to .
174050,sw3040,sv,"Well , at this stage I think we 've taxed property almost to the limit because ,"
118772,sw2900,sv,"People , um , you know , just go on and on and on ."
178325,sw3259,sv,and they have these really corny radio commercials --
93248,sw2828,sv,That 's more than a lot .
78037,sw2609,sv,"Um , it 's a problem if those voting do n't represent the population demographically , or in terms of their opinions ."
121575,sw2027,sv,"I , I am ."
90750,sw2252,sv,"Well , it 's amazing just because of the drain that 's been on , you know , both economies that our economy is , of course , been able to , uh , withstand that a little better ,"
126536,sw3464,sv,That 's a real good show .
109939,sw3283,sv,"But then they 're , they 're also entitled to drag it through the courts --"
160932,sw2262,sv,so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else .
124751,sw2793,sv,"But , uh , I do n't believe they accept you after you , you know , after you 're married"
105886,sw2616,sv,"Well , th- , it , it 's an advantage ."
162391,sw2915,sv,-- then they should pay taxes then .
116427,sw2287,sv,"or , you know , they 're both just as bad ,"
60198,sw2773,sv,"They can talk a good game ,"
176881,sw2998,sv,"There 's the lead pollution has , that problem , essentially I guess because it was at crisis proportions was ,"
5997,sw3265,sv,"I think that if I were really serious about looking for another car , I would take into consideration the price naturally ."
117066,sw2105,sv,So that should help .
173636,sw4113,sv,the world does not revolve around West Virginia --
161413,sw3693,sv,"but like you said , you tend to go more for the other one 's side --"
160277,sw2427,sv,"you , you have to work on ."
150160,sw2956,sv,"Uh , th- , that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every ,"
183066,sw4358,sv,"But more importantly , it 's recycling reusable materials back into , uh , manufacturing ."
54916,sw2175,sv,"-- so you , you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself ,"
118847,sw2537,sv,"It , it , uh , I guess it all comes down to , uh , you know , a , a definition of , uh , how much out , outside activities affect your work"
136895,sw3050,sv,"Miniature golf is great ,"
73843,sw2502,sv,"Well , I think that , uh , as a whole that the , being that the drug problem , the drug industry can , uh , bring so much money to a country ."
40106,sw3280,sv,"And that made you even feel a little more kin to , to what was going on ."
23252,sw2959,sv,"It has affected the culture of this country , uh ,"
127143,sw2952,sv,It is not too hard .
155749,sw2349,sv,"and that would upset a lot of people too ,"
201551,sw3140,sv,"And they 're not , um , th- , they do n't have the self-esteem that they need to have"
69171,sw2617,sv,"I mean , they were n't there by choice"
104881,sw2938,sv,"Well , that 's a good idea ."
20439,sw2812,sv,"I think that , uh , you know , you can just look at home life and see , I 've been talking to a lot of people a- , about education and things ,"
59796,sw2344,sv,"And , and they 're very dissatisfied ,"
58823,sw3121,sv,you went visiting .
85323,sw3367,sv,"but , but they , they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal ."
74920,sw2160,sv,"I mean , they 're going to want the money ,"
46339,sw2413,sv,"-- MUMBLEx and , the , the , the , uh , at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker --"
81344,sw2836,sv,"Uh , I think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty , you know , in a lot of cases ."
71826,sw2858,sv,"it 's always that way unti- , until it 's too late ."
58313,sw2340,sv,"it 's easy to say , Oh , yeah ,"
61591,sw2279,sv,Well maybe something will open up for you .
3356,sw2614,sv,"we see it , you know , once a month . I 'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that ."
116727,sw3096,sv,"Uh , I guess there 's more women in , uh , what would be classified as a man 's job ."
109367,sw3399,sv,"maybe some day I probably wo n't be alive to see it ,"
205218,sw2708,sv,"And , uh , you know , to start even that out we need to continue to , you know , at least threaten that , you know ,"
119900,sw3926,sv,but I think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision .
45247,sw2578,sv,It 's handy .
84497,sw3223,sv,"like I said , the risque stuff , just I guess they think that 's what people want to watch ."
33515,sw3077,sv,"And that 's when it really starts to add on ,"
170539,sw2559,sv,"The only thing really that can be changed is for us to , everybody to say , we 've had enough of you , out you go ."
29297,sw2292,sv,"in a smaller company it 's a little bit easier for them to say , Hey , you know , this person did a wonderful job , give him a big bonus kind of thing ."
109233,sw2893,sv,it 's dangerous .
86982,sw3150,sv,it 's not that bad of a life as it should be --
211744,sw3113,sv,"and so , when , uh , you or I as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what 's what because we see the headlines , uh ,"
128977,sw3429,sv,"and it always will be ,"
46951,sw2552,sv,"Oh , definitely motherhood is devalued in this s- , society ."
177304,sw3168,sv,and too many people are just dying .
52249,sw3428,sv,we maybe want to overthrow the government .
124033,sw3065,sv,"and we 're supposed to be , you know ,"
188009,sw4353,sv,"and it 's so much easier ,"
84506,sw3223,sv,"and when he left the show , you know , that , it seemed to be missing that part of it --"
22885,sw2621,sv,I think he was .
98612,sw3088,sv,"-- so it , I mean , it protects us in the long run hopefully --"
49304,sw2228,sv,"and I think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until , you know , late , you know , in the future ."
154800,sw2584,sv,"The rest , the rest of that is re- , really not the same ."
66379,sw2521,sv,"Ca n't ,"
116462,sw2287,sv,"I , I sometimes think that that should be limited more ."
110551,sw2849,sv,"I probably would say the something if I knew that inte- , intellectually that it was good"
20124,sw2478,sv,and I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks .
98797,sw2275,sv,you always kind of sit there

56143,sw4745,sv,"and I thought to myself , how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks ,"
208026,sw2759,sv,I guess so .
199160,sw2539,sv,"though we 've had such a breakdown in the family structure ,"
119392,sw2797,sv,I think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system .
679,sw2741,sv,"Uh , it 's just an economic need now ."
167831,sw2111,sv,"but , people are really concerned ,"
78669,sw2053,sv,"I mean it is relaxing to do , once you find the time to do it ."
98533,sw3088,sv,-- just a little --
148088,sw4077,sv,"if you are looking at like you know country that , uh , where they do have a lot more gun control , like England and places like that , you know"
153402,sw2669,sv,"As long as you can still buy a product in the English units , that 's how you 're going to think of it ."
72049,sw3576,sv,"Oh , the wild flowers are beautiful ."
109602,sw2313,sv,"but apparently that 's why the , uh , the , uh , the , uh , grocery stores are reluctant to do that , because their volume , that is quite high ,"
163381,sw2909,sv,"There , I do n't think there 's much of , much of one , because I 'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in ."
61738,sw2619,sv,things like that are a good start
9762,sw3979,sv,"and there are certainly benefits to its doing so ,"
17121,sw3319,sv,"and , you know , it 's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses ."
74083,sw2502,sv,"So , you 're going to have to expect it ."
45111,sw2323,sv,"and when you want to get out of the country , that 's what you want to do ."
59419,sw3692,sv,"You know , maybe you gain a little bit of local fame ,"
92961,sw2598,sv,"that was pretty good , though , really ."
120297,sw4707,sv,"I , I actually do n't think that we , uh , pay too much in this country . Uh --"
155662,sw2488,sv,"It 's just the system has just ,"
145163,sw2641,sv,"and , you know , they , you know , they , they make their mess in the cat pan which is ,"

117769,sw2514,sv,It 's just not good .
38387,sw2692,sv,"Maybe you 're right ,"
188734,sw4060,sv,"uh , the , there is not much incentive for innovativeness --"
199733,sw4123,sv,"their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than , say , your major network news and that kind of thing ."
119789,sw2283,sv,I think that 's how they measure dirt --
182583,sw4649,sv,"and you have to get a feel for , uh , how they treat the kids and , uh , uh , what kind of staff members they have and --"
39714,sw2935,sv,Maybe next year they 'll do better .
150275,sw2956,sv,and if there needs to be a change in a period of time .
191338,sw3075,sv,"and that 's , that 's kind of fun ."
196681,sw3133,sv,that 's something that I think that has been lost in families
189609,sw4830,sv,"But I think a lot of , all of the whole criminal system is messed up in , in that regard ."
90859,sw2252,sv,"so . That 's a ,"
137674,sw2585,sv,"I , I think it 's a wonderful thing to do ."
188988,sw4177,sv,"And there 's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist ,"
145762,sw4565,sv,that 's for sure .
183483,sw4048,sv,That 'd be just as dangerous .
20442,sw2812,sv,"and I think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore ,"
22981,sw2621,sv,"that 's kind of funny too , as a matter of fact ."
107251,sw3473,sv,"Well , that 's why --"
31047,sw2754,sv,"But it 's funny that , uh ,"
46955,sw2552,sv,"and , and a mother is n't an important --"
49407,sw3028,sv,What they use is roast beef .
2328,sw2788,sv,the basic family is not there anymore .
134842,sw2875,sv,"I mean , it just ,"
60192,sw2773,sv,it should be a mess .
70621,sw2460,sv,"I 'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people ,"
83419,sw4725,sv,"I mean there 's too many ,"
149453,sw3343,sv,"everything is so automated , uh ,"
144966,sw2372,sv,"It 's remarkable the things we can do now , and compared to , you know , a few years ."
22996,sw2621,sv,it 's funny some of their necks do n't get broken .
77637,sw4733,sv,and they 're --
49704,sw4644,sv,"And , and , of course , when it 's a small corporation , it also wants to expand"
51487,sw2610,sv,"and you do n't know which set to reach in , American or metric ."
83808,sw4376,sv,To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street .
36845,sw3061,sv,"they 're very ,"
127676,sw2180,sv,and money .
208084,sw2759,sv,if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers --
22515,sw3788,sv,"And , uh , without the Lord , they ca n't do it ."
76695,sw2365,sv,"but I ,"
176909,sw2998,sv,"we , we 've taken the intermediate step"
63849,sw2177,sv,"Well , I guess I will have to see it then ."
130168,sw2110,sv,"That 's good , especially since you call that one eight hundred number"
2015,sw2788,sv,"You know , I think it 's out of sight or out of mind ,"
93310,sw2828,sv,"That 's good as a , a , a teaching aid ."
153512,sw2669,sv,if it 's more than thirty it 's just hotter than all get out .
159898,sw2504,sv,"Well , you know , they 'd have to start when they 're real young ."
68840,sw2645,sv,"but , God this is much better than west Texas ."
23114,sw2621,sv,"and with age comes ,"
18595,sw3379,sv,I 'm sure they do .
181782,sw2896,sv,I may just be flat painting over it .
43034,sw3009,sv,"and , um , coming from , you know , that background and the background as a parent now , I think the reason that people do n't ask a whole lot of questions is a , a lot of times baby-sitters ,"
121580,sw2027,sv,"but I , it 's I do , I can , I can get so much more done if I 'm dressed comfortable , you know ."
102556,sw3279,sv,I really think the biggest problem
164320,sw2436,sv,"they do have a good , they do have good writers for that ."
155683,sw2349,sv,I think probably two years is too long .
194797,sw4129,sv,"Well , I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people ."
27522,sw2723,sv,"and I 'm saying that pensions , say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away , which it probably will ,"
210276,sw2370,sv,"but sometimes , it 's just , it 's baby-sitting ."
21532,sw2929,sv,"You really are ,"
23265,sw2959,sv,"A lot of shops are , are operated by southeast Asians ."
25887,sw2898,sv,"Because they , they start ,"
154701,sw3345,sv,but it 's still been bad --
154782,sw2584,sv,"That 's , that 's pretty average to me ."
151263,sw3062,sv,"And , and , uh , so that , that creates a problem ."
12641,sw2594,sv,I think it 's a good idea to make it mandatory .
55658,sw3518,sv,"Uh , but I think a person needs a way of defending themselves ."
116321,sw2287,sv,and I think it could get worse .
15386,sw2707,sv,"your , your trees grow up so well up there ,"
7855,sw2232,sv,"and I think that , I think we need to , a little more justice at home ."
21722,sw2437,sv,"it 's got to be with a very , very good agency ."
3295,sw2614,sv,"We do n't think of any one else but oursel- ,"
59001,sw3121,sv,Pittsburgh 's not quite so bad .
66767,sw4659,sv,We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing .
205481,sw3595,sv,Sounds like something she would write .
75516,sw2870,sv,And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved .
165518,sw2717,sv,"we can find out the truth ,"
132382,sw2663,sv,"it 's interesting how they say that when they 're usually the top dogs , you know ,"
63722,sw3523,sv,"I 'm sure , in Dallas since you 're big places , a lot more women are , uh , working right out of their home with their P C 's or with their lap computers or whatever ."
98777,sw2275,sv,"Well , I 'm afraid that 's what they , they really wanted to do , um ,"
53142,sw2934,sv,It 's really strange the way it does that .
105339,sw3012,sv,"and , and , you know , and , it , it 's almost like ,"
38543,sw3496,sv,That was .
117175,sw2105,sv,I guess it 's too early .
105929,sw2616,sv,"And , uh , it 's just that , you know , people , people take advantage of that ."
135464,sw2661,sv,well that makes a difference .
47988,sw2744,sv,"if , you know , in a democracy where , you know , people have kind of , uh , a freedom to sort of do what they want ,"
76061,sw2334,sv,"Well , they 're dangerous ."
16888,sw3738,sv,It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession --
148158,sw4077,sv,"And you know , you 're pretty much dead you know ."
190449,sw4318,sv,"but it , you know --"
82097,sw2724,sv,That 's pretty impressive .
117799,sw2514,sv,"It makes , you know , pressure on the nation , and on the people , and on the leadership , and makes their inflation go up ,"
137957,sw3870,sv,and they 're both inevitable .
92831,sw2598,sv,"I , I could n't see it worth getting a nomination for , uh , best picture ."
156054,sw3487,sv,"And , uh , uh , uh , they could , they could work and earn money towards college ."
126449,sw3828,sv,"but I do n't think that 's going to happen because , just like you said ,"
19298,sw3774,sv,"and , and that 's pretty much what it is , is --"
133309,sw2387,sv,It seems like every week they pick ten
203001,sw2429,sv,That sounds right I
85741,sw2472,sv,"So , I , I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find , find really good recipes where you would n't even think about it ."
108265,sw3537,sv,"It should n't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that , you know , reasonableness ."
61377,sw2279,sv,and that must be the thing .
30462,sw3226,sv,and that still goes on .
73738,sw2092,sv,"we 've got a , several credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time ."
167722,sw2615,sv,So it 's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things .
114081,sw4080,sv,For me I would much rather have a bow anytime .
192712,sw2109,sv,That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people .
41520,sw3204,sv,that would be devastating I 'm sure
48131,sw2744,sv,"they 're going to be on everyone 's mind for quite a while , too long ."
43258,sw2767,sv,"But they may not go into teaching ,"
49248,sw2228,sv,like my since is it was there to try to protect small investors
108001,sw2065,sv,"That 's , that 's been interesting , though , the kids that have been over , you know , coming back right now , you know ."
35359,sw3257,sv,"I just , I love that , all those , that two hours --"
103863,sw3504,sv,"It 's just going to effect on the , the team , you know ."
68035,sw2032,sv,"That 's , that 's ,"
116687,sw3131,sv,"So , it 's difficult ,"
42762,sw2839,sv,"and , uh , ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in , you know ,"
95206,sw2435,sv,"And I think it 's an excellent movie for ,"
62301,sw2051,sv,"and you know , what frightens me , is that , you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert --"
80531,sw2461,sv,That 's all you can do .
21605,sw2929,sv,and it does n't seem to matter .
150325,sw2956,sv,Now everybody is available .
113442,sw2969,sv,"Oh , I bet you those are , I bet you what those things are , uh , is a Dutch iris ."
112655,sw2380,sv,"and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes , you know , the juries come down with a result and you go , gee ."
86725,sw2302,sv,"But the way our system , our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time ."
166499,sw2860,sv,"but it 's funny ,"
128039,sw3556,sv,"but , uh , you know , this ring of honor thing , you know , he needs to be there --"
91582,sw2285,sv,"that 's good , that sounds like they 've got a lot going on there ."
75259,sw3425,sv,"It keeps going ,"
131360,sw3063,sv,"it 's going to , it 's probably going to be a generation or two before ,"
54132,sw2780,sv,and and both of them
212805,sw2018,sv,"I think it 's great ,"
101164,sw2073,sv,"and whether you vote for one person or the other person , the issues is what , you know , what you believe in ,"
130298,sw3036,sv,"Well , the big key is that , I think you 've already stated , that all music is rooted in the classics"
53329,sw3046,sv,"They have a lot of vegetable to them ,"
71254,sw2041,sv,"California gets , you know , tends to be a bit faddish ,"
13252,sw3500,sv,Just to prevent a --
160021,sw2427,sv,and it takes up your whole space .
150397,sw2078,sv,Not lately though .
128618,sw2622,sv,"and they are controlled , or pretty much do what they want to do ."
155660,sw2488,sv,"we 're really going to do it , you know ."
28382,sw4822,sv,"We ca n't live here ,"
118345,sw3056,sv,"and ,"
125735,sw3071,sv,so --
72202,sw2840,sv,"You know what scares me too , is that we have yet to see other , the biggest effect of the crack children --"
171131,sw2790,sv,"You know , it 's going to kind of kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway and , or in the garage or whatever ."
83409,sw4725,sv,"Oh I , I 've got all four feet in the trough , you know , being a federal employee ."
50669,sw4681,sv,"And I know a lot of , uh , corporations now are looking at their amount of money that 's being spent"
109963,sw3283,sv,"I think that needs to ,"
51182,sw2576,sv,"well , it started spiraling down , I suppose , in the seventies ,"
36384,sw2389,sv,"Well , if they do , they do n't know it , you know ."
41234,sw2234,sv,I feel like you get what you pay for
60266,sw2773,sv,That 's the major thing .
13770,sw2368,sv,"I mean , I think everybody just lives under an umbrella , the uncertainty with housing --"
103674,sw3666,sv,"Well , there is n't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes ."
119922,sw3926,sv,"and , uh , what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand --"
186013,sw2945,sv,"I think it , it really , it really helped to have that time together ."
189814,sw4340,sv,"-- and , uh , the premeditated murders , the ones where the person plots and plans , when you catch those , those individuals , I think that you , you end up with a , uh , uh , how do I want to , you end up with a s- , you end up with someone who 's more dangerous to society --"
144285,sw2249,sv,They do n't mash .
137871,sw3681,sv,"the Lions are pretty good , I 'm afraid , they pro- , a lot better team than the Cowboys were today ."
99575,sw2226,sv,"oh , they 're good ,"
147250,sw2490,sv,"I mean , there are a lot of kids who when they 're ten look like they 're twelve ,"
196567,sw3133,sv,"I think everybody should , should , uh , put in their time so to speak for the , for the good of the , the nation and for the good of themselves ."
43845,sw2995,sv,You ca n't force them to be .
134374,sw3039,sv,and --
193858,sw4038,sv,"although in my case I might have been more , uh , sympathetic with the person who got caught ,"
14880,sw2709,sv,"And , and that might be the solution ."
41643,sw2942,sv,"That would ,"
73865,sw2502,sv,"or , you know , why , why , why intervene in another country 's , you know , problems and things like that ."
170260,sw3655,sv,"Well , and you know their , kind of their schedules"
198168,sw3083,sv,"and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society ,"
162691,sw2921,sv,"-- and , uh , of course , most of the homes are , you know , fairly nice ,"
172029,sw3325,sv,"and they just , they just wreck things"
99106,sw2094,sv,People also have to realize they ca n't have their cake and eat it .
79940,sw4796,sv,Now let 's --
117348,sw2642,sv,"I wish that they would come up with some other way to , you know ,"
92444,sw2676,sv,and you very seldom see it though .
48107,sw2744,sv,"But you know , you can counsel a kid eight hours a day"
156972,sw3052,sv,"And that , I think is what is scary ,"
194564,sw4619,sv,"It , it 's possible ,"
33167,sw3057,sv,"Care for the elderly and care for the children ,"
80530,sw2461,sv,"and ,"
42721,sw2839,sv,"I think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens , we 're going to have to bite the bullet ."
178155,sw2658,sv,"But if you do a good job , you feel enough satisfaction ,"
193736,sw3798,sv,"Uh , course , there 's so many things in the world where , if you solve one problem , you may be creating another , you know ."
111840,sw2476,sv,you 're not too surprised on much of anything .
20689,sw2812,sv,"and , um , it 's just individual choices ."
158841,sw3663,sv,"so we really do n't have , as long a cold season , I guess as people up north ."
173111,sw3417,sv,"and out of each pay check so much comes out of it ,"
43425,sw2767,sv,"I think we , uh , are programmed to just take it --"
163108,sw2874,sv,but all they 're good for is the fight .
76840,sw3811,sv,"And if it 's ,"
47844,sw3118,sv,"I think he can be , you know , I , I do n't know if it 's the way it is in real life ,"
110400,sw3449,sv,"it used to ,"
192286,sw3227,sv,"-- the drummer plays a certain beat ,"
162692,sw2921,sv,"they 're , uh , done up fairly nice , uh ,"
108605,sw3359,sv,"that 'll , that 'll literally blow your head off ,"
66978,sw3294,sv,"and then you , you know , you go down a path --"
13721,sw2368,sv,And they do n't have to worry about yard upkeep if they do n't hardly have any .
205089,sw2708,sv,"Well , see the other way I 'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting , like , uh , the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons . Anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves ."
102208,sw2549,sv,"but I , I guess , uh , when you have a whole bunch of , uh , professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody 's got great hopes ."
78002,sw3988,sv,"I mean , some people sing ,"
121825,sw2452,sv,because it 's a world thing
123001,sw2647,sv,"and so , you probably come out of it knowing , and by friends , I mean , like contacts for when you get out of school , um , you know ,"
91328,sw2540,sv,"But I , I think definitely ,"
197191,sw4877,sv,"But it 's really , it 's really , really very difficult"
15962,sw2953,sv,"To me ,"
18571,sw3379,sv,"and all the republic is trying to gain their independence ,"
141233,sw2221,sv,"has nothing , you know ."
31201,sw2754,sv,"That 's something , you know ,"
195399,sw2546,sv,"And you can ,"
42230,sw3751,sv,so you use a credit card .
117815,sw2514,sv,See that broke out a revival in Mexico City . That C B S news and A B C never told you about .
81315,sw2836,sv,"I think they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use ."
59869,sw2418,sv,"Oh , I think that 's a ,"
49168,sw2228,sv,or --
205267,sw3476,sv,no one knows what that is .
22119,sw2960,sv,"this is terrible ,"
105637,sw2962,sv,"Anyway , the deterrent ."
95581,sw2819,sv,"that 's just , that 's one thing I see , I see a lot more , you know , double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that , I guess ."
116253,sw2424,sv,"Well , that 's my problem too ."
65326,sw2533,sv,You probably ca n't afford to eat if you have more than two of them .
206131,sw3411,sv,but they 're supposed to be just real smooth .
168572,sw2826,sv,but that 's the same
47768,sw3457,sv,"And , uh , they expect us to , you know , have , create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers --"
188296,sw2184,sv,"So I think some place , you know , places like that , it should be like mandatory --"
17197,sw2191,sv,that can be awful .
54151,sw2780,sv,But I I guess actually I believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag I guess that 's their opportunity
90420,sw4071,sv,"and , uh , she works as a waitress"
129874,sw2736,sv,"but if your door comes open , you know , it 's not going to do you any good ."
160321,sw2427,sv,"They 're pretty neat little ,"
170614,sw3344,sv,"I , uh , I think that , uh , for once , we should , we should n't even be at , at these Mid East talks because , with the exception of our hostages , we really do n't have too much of a , uh , real in- , we should n't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is ."
192842,sw2109,sv,"Well , I 'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them ."
184110,sw4319,sv,"and , uh , benefits were just amazing --"
182219,sw2554,sv,"It 's , it 's like our car industry ,"
83461,sw4725,sv,They do n't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards .
111953,sw2476,sv,"so ,"
199044,sw2539,sv,or they 're stuck in a day care .
46169,sw3104,sv,"and then , then start looking for schools ."
37685,sw3346,sv,"-- and I think that art of giving is something that , um , we do n't have very much any more ."
134864,sw2875,sv,"somebody 's finally woken up , you know ."
161824,sw2820,sv,"Those are just to get , probably to get some sort of , those are to get the shock value out of you ."
26039,sw2967,sv,I think one is enough .
156164,sw4013,sv,"and then if you want to play something on the little kids ' level , then the older kids get real bored ,"
21050,sw2675,sv,I think I agree with that very much .
170347,sw4347,sv,"But , uh , that 's the way it is ."
163457,sw2909,sv,"and that 's , you know , one reason that I did it --"
195671,sw4320,sv,"Uh , there 's no way they can stop the drugs ,"
35954,sw2689,sv,"Well ,"
179694,sw4801,sv,"-- and it 's really , you know , it 's , it gets to be a r- , a big problem ."
42696,sw2839,sv,"but the government does it ,"
205220,sw2708,sv,"But , uh , it 's just that , uh , they 're , eh ,"
32917,sw3057,sv,"Uh , it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity --"
29018,sw2834,sv,"and , and the way you are also has changed , though ."
2419,sw4774,sv,"And a lot of times , those are the things I do n't like to disclose to an employer because then they do n't want to have anything to do with you ."
110961,sw3805,sv,We only see the tip of the iceberg only .
30631,sw2982,sv,"It would be more convenient , more productive --"
151493,sw3047,sv,"situations like that , you do n't realize , you know , until you start thinking about it , the kinds of MUMBLEx advantages you school may have over others ."
157513,sw3021,sv,They have got them outgunned .
182149,sw2554,sv,It 's religion couched as politics .
89107,sw2599,sv,I guess you keep those things you grew up with .
37667,sw3346,sv,but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps --
85958,sw2421,sv,"it would be unfair ,"
15796,sw2953,sv,"Well see , that , that is the spirit of the sixties ."
132966,sw3095,sv,Those that should be in jail should be in jail .
105992,sw3557,sv,"So I think that , uh , they need to look into it"
213291,sw3142,sv,"So , uh , just a , just a change of pace --"
54123,sw2780,sv,and next thing you know MUMBLEx somebody 's trying to take more .
75547,sw2870,sv,"Which I guess if you got turmoil in your personal life , you 're going to let it come into work"
109585,sw2313,sv,"and I think that 's where ,"
4592,sw2168,sv,"-- and that is , that 's what makes ,"
199778,sw4123,sv,I guess that 's true .
131250,sw3063,sv,that 's probably a major one .
118774,sw2900,sv,"or , and it just extends with i- , if it , w , what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on"
103968,sw3504,sv,"It 's going to be depending on where the , what they do with Ruben Sierra"
174783,sw3320,sv,"but our crimes up here , uh , as I think it must be in most cities now ,"
103974,sw3504,sv,"I mean , it 's time to , to either , you know , put out or shut up ."
171290,sw2439,sv,"Of course , they 're fully loaded usually ."
193515,sw4356,sv,It 's comfortable to drive .
33199,sw3276,sv,Everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits .
163388,sw2909,sv,So he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us .
119428,sw2797,sv,"And so it , it works out nice ,"
169272,sw3099,sv,"and you just miss the little things ,"
120528,sw3143,sv,that 's scary .
49855,sw3167,sv,I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality .
109930,sw3283,sv,"maybe it should be , uh , well , it should be given , you know , I , I wo n't say sparingly ,"
128628,sw2622,sv,And generally it does work out that way .
148487,sw4154,sv,"but on the same token , you know , Israel has lost a lot of their , you know , value to the U S in being , you know , the foothold of capitalism ."
25802,sw2898,sv,that 's where it 's at .
94856,sw2485,sv,That 's really neat .
56477,sw2227,sv,"Trying to write an essay , you start talking about , you know , like , IN LIVING COLOR or something ,"
64092,sw4363,sv,"It 's kind of , it 's kind of strange ."
162468,sw3662,sv,Yet --
96228,sw3387,sv,That 's what you pay
124896,sw2793,sv,"And maybe if we instilled the work ethic , you know ,"
5107,sw3233,sv,so even if it 's the country that they 're from or anything like that .
80893,sw2121,sv,This country seems to be a little behind on that .
177959,sw2658,sv,They probably did n't know what they were talking about .
81996,sw2441,sv,That 's wrong .
59639,sw2344,sv,"I mean , if we were to , if , if something were to happen , I 'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of , for the sake of , uh , of , of unity against us or something --"
135941,sw4856,sv,It does n't have any real impact on them .
190824,sw3658,sv,but I 'm sure that there were people that do n't .
48628,sw2149,sv,I think it 's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two .
45282,sw2578,sv,"that , television , it gives you everything ."
193374,sw4127,sv,"It was n't bad ,"
9797,sw2716,sv,"I feel like there should be some kind of coverage made ,"
185101,sw3506,sv,That sounds good .
111415,sw3651,sv,It 's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day
181620,sw2896,sv,and you get some beautiful effects with them .
158878,sw3663,sv,and they 're not too pleasant .
170054,sw3070,sv,"all , it 's a home centered , you know , it 's all family centered anyway ,"
209830,sw3862,sv,"And another thing to think about , uh , on the positive side of the nursing homes here ,"
78158,sw2609,sv,"I mean , you , I mean , it 's , it 's funny because technically you do ."
147080,sw3103,sv,Men have a lot of trouble with that though .
70079,sw2486,sv,"because maybe they , those are not the clothes that are the most , uh , appealing to you , or the most , uh , complimentary to you ."
172494,sw3085,sv,"and , uh , I , but I think that would , but as far as looking for a place , you know , I , the criteria , I mean , I think it 's very important to have very caring people , you know --"
114061,sw4080,sv,"I guess , I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I 'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon ."
6190,sw2684,sv,and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work .
61249,sw2124,sv,"but , it seemed kind of boring compared ,"
182064,sw2554,sv,"You know , I mean you ca n't please them one way or the other ."
165427,sw2717,sv,everybody 's got that .
2831,sw2038,sv,"Uh , starving to death is not a , not a whole lot of fun either"
205131,sw2708,sv,But that would come down .
209548,sw2305,sv,"I mean as far as selecting , selecting a school , I , I , I feel that , uh , a lot of it depends upon the major ."
16840,sw3738,sv,"not very , not very long ago , seemed like the whole world , not just the United States , but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in , uh , you know , a very comfortable position , so to say , even though the , the cold war was , was in full swing . You know ,"
17412,sw3042,sv,And it 's just causing chaos
76801,sw3811,sv,"and , uh , there are a lot of things to think about"
178165,sw2658,sv,"I think they underestimate how much , how much value the satisfaction"
104391,sw4723,sv,it was like a big marshmallow .
91101,sw2818,sv,"Well , you sound like you 're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about ,"
30804,sw2794,sv,"but Lord knows you sh- , one should n't say that ."
133935,sw2999,sv,it would be ridiculous .
129793,sw2736,sv,Or how you could afford it .
167643,sw2615,sv,"I 'm convinced that the small V eight like the , the Mustang 's original two eighty-nine or some of the Chevy two eighty-threes ,"
188348,sw2184,sv,"peer group is the other way now instead of ,"
186634,sw3351,sv,something giving you some affection as well .
103261,sw2197,sv,"But , uh , having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there , uh , is investing in the Air Force ,"
90275,sw4603,sv,"MUMBLEx and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially . As , as an instrument of U S policy ."
86491,sw2657,sv,And the young people are overly impressed .
200954,sw4342,sv,"Uh , if there 's something you want to know , it 's , it 's in the TIMES and then , and in detail ."
117975,sw2575,sv,"I think it 's , uh , a good idea ."
132478,sw2663,sv,But they 're still fighting about it because of the --
45257,sw2578,sv,you have to work at it .
83623,sw2672,sv,You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf .
76882,sw3811,sv,"I think that , uh , my own interest in , in development , human development --"
189631,sw4830,sv,"and if , they should pay for it with their life ."
153509,sw2669,sv,"and if it 's ten and twenty it 's not too bad ,"
212859,sw2018,sv,but at least the wheels are moving forward .
186370,sw4153,sv,you do n't see that much .
30370,sw3852,sv,"Well , that certainly would be a wonderful , comfortable machine to take on long trips --"
29615,sw2854,sv,"So , I think that 's som- , th , something that couples need in going --"
174458,sw2910,sv,"but it 's , it 's coverage , you know ."
153396,sw2669,sv,"You buy a quart of milk ,"
22757,sw2353,sv,"Not enough people want to do that to ,"
194363,sw2451,sv,"what we consider just , I do n't , normal everyday things to them is real luxury ."
30711,sw2982,sv,"-- and that , that would be great ,"
150268,sw2956,sv,"Oh , he , he he gave it ,"
110922,sw3805,sv,they pull the strings .
174573,sw2910,sv,We almost have too much .
76085,sw2334,sv,"Well , and you 're tempted if you 've got cash , a little bit of cash , and you do n't have enough for the purchase , right ."
105247,sw3012,sv,"I really do . In , in a major way because they just , um , that whole region over there , I think needs to settle its own differences within itself ."
121884,sw2452,sv,"You know , he was n't necessarily for Iraq"
77489,sw3074,sv,"I think that it has to really hit home before ,"
148089,sw4077,sv,the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much .
17812,sw3908,sv,a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that 's what everybody else assumes they are going to get .
96936,sw2314,sv,"Well , they might tell you it 's random ."
130779,sw3340,sv,"-- I think , I think , looking at athletes being drug tested --"
58203,sw2340,sv,"If you just have people your own age , you never get a chance to see kids or anything --"
23447,sw2959,sv,"And he just , he did not want to be in it any more than , than what we started out in August with Desert Storm ."
204645,sw2749,sv,"But , if there are some people who do n't agree --"
2914,sw3034,sv,I guess I 'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football .
100283,sw2397,sv,That 's funny .
116146,sw2424,sv,"I , I could just picture wha , what 's going to happen here in the not to distant future ."
50808,sw4735,sv,"you know , i- , it , they should have , they should have the same rights as anyone else --"
96978,sw2314,sv,"the , I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it 's across the board from , from the janitors to the executive management ."
27831,sw2557,sv,"But once they get established , then it 's a money saving thing ."
12193,sw2827,sv,that 's always the way to do it .
72212,sw2840,sv,"Too many times students get diagnosed as mo- , slow learners ,"
46333,sw2413,sv,"Oh , um , I think he 's got good intentions ,"
38801,sw2968,sv,"well , not everything"
148459,sw3300,sv,"But , uh , I think once you 're set in your ways , you 're set in your ways ."
160626,sw3419,sv,"Well , Taco Bueno 's good ."
7749,sw2232,sv,"but it 's in spiritual kingdoms , and that the real warfare is done , you know , in your prayer closet , on your knees ."
3305,sw2614,sv,"but I do n't think that they 're going , they 're going to change that ,"
24193,sw2471,sv,"but , but , with the Persian Gulf , as you said , it 's just , uh , been very quiet ."
95682,sw2819,sv,"I guess if this is the only place you 've lived , Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas ."
208100,sw2759,sv,I guess if you 're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences .
127686,sw2180,sv,"but I 'd , I also feel , as you said , that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup , uh , back , uh , in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today 's standard of living and the , the , uh , level of education of them , of so many people now , uh ,"
131781,sw3535,sv,"Boy , it is a big problem ,"
84942,sw2527,sv,I think we fulfilled our obligation .
46651,sw3064,sv,"And but it , but it is easy to get into a credit card problem ,"
116290,sw2287,sv,"and , uh , there 's usually nobody running against , you know , the incumbents ."
24211,sw2471,sv,"and so , uh , there 's a lot of money to be made there ,"
134727,sw2875,sv,"now the Lexus are very nice looking cars ,"
1062,sw2040,sv,"well I guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory ,"
80959,sw2121,sv,"Uh , but you know a proposal to , uh , uh , I guess the proper authorities ,"
172532,sw3085,sv,"They are to be there ahead of time , you know ,"
91597,sw2285,sv,"It 's just , it 's the morals of the people which , I mean , I guess we , everybody 's responsible for the society ,"
114821,sw4147,sv,"and I think that 's one of the , uh , the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is , you know , do you have the room for this dog to run around ,"
68386,sw3333,sv,"I think that 's where it stems from , is that and , um , you know , you 've got a lot of , a lot more women that are working nowadays --"
183325,sw4133,sv,"I think it 's mainly , people , like , they get the vengeance of it ."
61780,sw3746,sv,I think that might be true .
159998,sw2427,sv,"And especially when the weather 's not too hot or ,"
64431,sw4691,sv,"and they , uh , uh , and they have a good time and everything"
67120,sw4022,sv,"and they , in my opinion , do n't do a very responsible job --"
109557,sw2313,sv,"-- you know , they 're convenient , you know ,"
174036,sw3040,sv,everyone thinks taxes are too high I 'm sure .
205697,sw3781,sv,"Uh , but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when , when you start using more than a few --"
63106,sw2545,sv,"so , you know , it was n't really worth it to him to do , to do it ."
165140,sw3720,sv,"People are ,"
119255,sw3845,sv,"Well , you know , if you 've ever gotten anything , you know , in your life , your , your name is somewhere ."
185607,sw4362,sv,But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid .
205397,sw3561,sv,"in the longer term , uh , we , we , we 'd do well , I think to make , to make , uh , reductions there ."
189783,sw4340,sv,"I mean , just general society to ,"
155390,sw2488,sv,"then it should happen ,"
31202,sw2754,sv,"but , uh , wh- , whether they plea bargain or not , if they 're guilty of murder , they 're guilty of murder , you know ."
7943,sw2770,sv,"They just give it ,"
116186,sw2424,sv,There should be some sort of a control on it .
191625,sw4336,sv,"but you 'd be surprised also how , much people watch you that even not , uh , participating in any type crime ."
108249,sw3537,sv,"I mean , doctors routinely send people in for anything ."
143675,sw2157,sv,they 're going to get better .
162206,sw2897,sv,and how much profit they 're making
178007,sw2658,sv,"I think , uh , uh , there 's a lot not to be said for credit"
181163,sw2247,sv,"I think that 's when you , you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have ."
29315,sw2292,sv,"Well , I was going to say , it sounds like you , you picked out a lot of good things , you know , for him , to , to , uh , to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it ."
59063,sw3489,sv,"And I think , uh , overall that 's an , an excellent opportunity"
887,sw3426,sv,"They say MUMBLEx is really frightening , too ."
41096,sw2234,sv,"and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and , and things like that"
165488,sw2717,sv,"the only consolation is so many of the murders are , you know ,"
20104,sw2478,sv,this is going to be fun .
141806,sw2393,sv,"Oh , it 's awful the first house ."
163295,sw2842,sv,"but , I think that 's that is a big problem . The television"
30660,sw2982,sv,certainly something like day care at the work place --
174655,sw2558,sv,"And , and I suppose that there is , uh , justification for taking everybody if you take anybody ."
140483,sw2690,sv,I think that is just a hoot .
169628,sw3256,sv,"well , and too , you know , they can always be blaming the other person ,"
192893,sw3435,sv,I guess that 's the best I ever got was lousy .
43861,sw2995,sv,"Of course , he 's breaking the law all the time ,"
166056,sw2231,sv,-- and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system .
88,sw3743,sv,"-- and , and they 're contributing to the income besides ."
86952,sw3150,sv,"and I , I think there 's a , a shadow of a doubt , you know , like with this , this guy in , in Milwaukee ."
116204,sw2424,sv,but you might be right .
119243,sw3845,sv,that 's also an invasion of privacy .
87577,sw2020,sv,"seems to be the hot one of , of today ."
81890,sw2441,sv,Well just ridiculous .
168368,sw2826,sv,It 's interesting
114059,sw4080,sv,it 's one of things
55804,sw2983,sv,"But it is a good healthy , wholesome lifestyle , uh ,"
166241,sw2784,sv,"I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways ."
159102,sw2526,sv,"well , that 's probably influenced maybe a little bit ."
74913,sw2160,sv,"I mean , the thing is is that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right ,"
169590,sw3256,sv,"And the parents are saying , Hey , wait a minute ,"
81961,sw2441,sv,"Well , you know , you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house ."
105272,sw3012,sv,"You know , an , an , I , I think that , um ,"
35094,sw2957,sv,Really sad .
102414,sw3232,sv,"-- so depending on what your major is , or medical , you might want to atteck , some , um , attend somewhere like Tech --"
26053,sw2967,sv,"But , I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched ."
76209,sw2334,sv,Get you a little MUMBLEx plaque .
104444,sw4723,sv,"It 's not like , like driving a little sports car ."
22943,sw2621,sv,they ca n't survive .
173703,sw3809,sv,"and they 're , and they 're doing the same , uh , or carrying the same job responsibility --"
184119,sw4319,sv,"Uh , but , uh , it could be better ,"

170481,sw2559,sv,"Something that I feel is a , is a , pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that 's really so common that it 's accepted as the norm now , is the op , the open office concept ."
165599,sw2717,sv,"but it , it 's not worth somebody getting executed for ."
79642,sw2130,sv,"and looks uh , that the joining of forces for this , uh , uh , Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing ."
13742,sw2368,sv,"you know , if it 's going to get me , it 's get me ."
140670,sw4840,sv,"You know , that , that 's , that 's scary too ."
110528,sw2849,sv,"I , I do n't , I do n't think it 's really to their best interests ,"
49156,sw2228,sv,"I think people just started , you know , no- , not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever , you know , whenever they gave them out ."
104052,sw3049,sv,That was a really good movie .
156084,sw3487,sv,"and , you know , there is just , I think it 's just trouble waiting to happen ."
38838,sw2968,sv,the photographers just got --
74610,sw2445,sv,"that would , that would be much ."
141427,sw2025,sv,Well this has been an interesting conversation .
198943,sw4090,sv,That --
182463,sw4682,sv,Service is more of a problem .
166192,sw2784,sv,"why I , I 'm , I 'm a little concerned about today is that this , uh , rather , uh , quick and , and easy , I do n't know , I should n't say easy , rather quick victory in the , in , in the , uh , Mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , Iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe ."
198166,sw3083,sv,"but whereas like in , uh , a person that , uh , stud- ,"
169052,sw2316,sv,"You know , there 's no point in , you know ,"
147233,sw2490,sv,"I mean ,"
123952,sw3065,sv,"And if they kept it up ,"
72168,sw2840,sv,it 's interesting
83312,sw2703,sv,I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED
211652,sw3925,sv,You can make laws against corruption .
70591,sw2460,sv,"but when you get two strikes on you , you have a tend- , you know , you should , you know , shorten your swing a little bit , you know ,"
204933,sw3171,sv,"And really , for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent ."
110904,sw3805,sv,"and in our society , uh , there 's very little full employment ."
30914,sw2794,sv,It seems only fair .
33192,sw3276,sv,"I think it 's time that we start looking at , uh , getting into that ."
21163,sw2675,sv,"and they try to solve them and everything ,"
57438,sw3855,sv,and then --
56830,sw3076,sv,"-- I mean , it 's just , I think that eventually , you know , the better people have sensibilities"
35027,sw2957,sv,"Scary ,"
16323,sw3059,sv,"You were n't sure exactly how it would get there ,"
28890,sw2834,sv,"they sort of threw the thing back another , you know , ten years ,"
170264,sw3655,sv,"I do n't know how , uh , people , uh , that have young kids working work full time and , and do it , really , without being stressed out all the time ."
67776,sw3458,sv,"Uh , it 's just , you know , does n't seem to have enough story to it ."
123438,sw2482,sv,"and , uh , kids eat funny ."
64640,sw3443,sv,That 's another consideration .
168107,sw3328,sv,"no big elaborate laws that say , uh , you know , call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review ."
194287,sw2451,sv,"So that 's a good move , on , on Gorbachev 's part in doing that ."
67950,sw3628,sv,"It 's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity , and --"
157434,sw2407,sv,"It 's pretty sad to think , uh , about those who , even today , are graduating from school"
136597,sw3000,sv,"Well that 's funny ,"
14285,sw2930,sv,There 's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere .
33507,sw3077,sv,"yet , your absolutely right ."
94285,sw2602,sv,"So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils ,"
122142,sw2181,sv,"and it would have make it , uh , broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for , I thought --"
84048,sw2465,sv,but it 's a lot to put into one .
160278,sw2427,sv,"You ,"
65601,sw2010,sv,"But I thought , it 's good that , you know ,"
190324,sw4341,sv,Might make you feel better
14641,sw2342,sv,"And , you know , in some sense , m- , the moderates may be right ."
67063,sw4022,sv,"but with this peace dividend , it seems like you could set up some kind of like --"
169171,sw2316,sv,support the church instead .
59360,sw3692,sv,"I mean , it 's just the amount that you 're overspending ,"
165134,sw3720,sv,"and I 'm not , um , totally innocent of that because ,"
130345,sw2265,sv,"today 's , uh , means of communication , we could , a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information ."
51489,sw2610,sv,"and , and , you 're never quite sure ,"
33395,sw3198,sv,and they get together
74017,sw2502,sv,"because I think that they are pretty vocal about it in , in , uh , Africa ."
2073,sw2788,sv,"we should have discussed this earlier ,"
46316,sw2413,sv,"I think it 's , I think what 's interesting is that , uh , the political activists , Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating ."
112092,sw2989,sv,"because if , uh , kids do n't look up to you , or , or , ca , ca n't feel they can spend time with you , they 're going to find someone else --"
55490,sw2844,sv,"Well , the only thing that we can do as citizens is , you know , like , uh , watch groups that they 'll have ."
81965,sw2441,sv,Parents are n't parents any more .
20191,sw2478,sv,and the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich .
166511,sw2860,sv,"you just felt , gee , if I were n't here ,"
88568,sw2039,sv,"You can look at it , you know ,"
179614,sw3015,sv,"so they ,"
87639,sw2020,sv,I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer .
17706,sw3158,sv,"I , I would n't if I did n't have this car time ability probably --"
140837,sw2178,sv,"You know , Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be , uh , a bit of a variety actor , you know ."
124389,sw3029,sv,"and there 's probably thousands of holes in that theory ,"
86962,sw3150,sv,"Well , I have a hun- , I have a hunch that , you know , the other prisoners are n't going to be too happy with him anyway . Either ,"
1483,sw2325,sv,"That 's the hardest thing I think , you know --"
131338,sw3063,sv,"We really have to do more ,"
115905,sw2620,sv,"I thinks it 's a marvelous activity for younger families because , uh ,"
156060,sw3487,sv,and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is .
199423,sw2628,sv,"And , uh , because if you have , you know , two , well , if you go to work , you 're , just working to pay for day care ,"
119898,sw3926,sv,and they 've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage .
51501,sw2610,sv,It 's a hundred meter .
103071,sw2197,sv,"So , it 's , it 's really kind of crazy ."
45068,sw2323,sv,I do n't believe that anybody should die --
204253,sw2406,sv,That sounds like an interesting concept .
147833,sw4902,sv,and so they can almost always find room for someone like that .
17272,sw2191,sv,"but you , you 're doing it for fun ."
180565,sw3311,sv,I think . It 's very cold .
166478,sw2860,sv,but I think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours .
99725,sw2226,sv,"But , uh , most of the time they do n't with , when , follow books very well when they make them into movies ."
97947,sw2362,sv,"but I do n't think they could cover everything that you could teach ,"
50720,sw4681,sv,"Put people into , you know , January or February which is always suppose to be ,"
79599,sw2130,sv,"today the Turks , uh , agreed to support the Kurds , which is something they 've never done before"
115683,sw3030,sv,"or anyway it was , it was difficult ."
3263,sw2614,sv,and I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too
6159,sw2684,sv,"But it , it really does n't take their pain away ."
2541,sw2289,sv,"Oh , they should definitely get , um , the nickel returnable ."
131345,sw3063,sv,but there 's not enough .
62009,sw2597,sv,but we 've kind of driven these people out .
51840,sw3363,sv,but --
6105,sw2684,sv,"And then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs ,"
69730,sw3111,sv,they have induced it themselves .
85802,sw4311,sv,"well , you know , the , uh , uh , the world is changing f- , uh , from instit- , from , uh , industrial , uh , base to , uh , information base"
182194,sw2554,sv,"Well , I 'm not real sure that 's , that 's appropriate ."
58652,sw2467,sv,"It , and it does n't seem to get much better for the exempts either , unless you 're twenty-eight or above ."
49188,sw2228,sv,"because they were like oh , well , we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it ."
77656,sw4733,sv,and say just do this .
102555,sw3279,sv,"they do n't , they do n't seem to , well ,"
92464,sw2676,sv,"and then , I think , you know , all that falling would warm it up and melt it ,"
141346,sw2025,sv,"it 's not just like one instance , or something , it 's just , uh , horrifying , some of the murders that go on ."
141229,sw2221,sv,"but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from , or beat to death"
51849,sw3363,sv,"Well , the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the --"
156636,sw4064,sv,"Uh , I think that , uh , in such cases , uh , they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased ."
39157,sw3170,sv,"I , I ca n't see paying an annual fee for it ."
49967,sw2862,sv,I guess it 's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy .
102075,sw3245,sv,because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you --
167123,sw3041,sv,"Maybe i- , well , maybe that was , um ,"
5688,sw2944,sv,"Well there 's , there 's all sorts of scare tactics , I guess , to , to invade our privacy"
138001,sw3870,sv,"and it does n't allocate resources oftenly because there is a tendency , uh , at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills ,"
176109,sw4697,sv,"Uh , I , I think that in some cases that 's considered to prejudice the current case --"
18306,sw4788,sv,"With kids they do n't care , you know , uh , a l- , about a lot of things ."
66439,sw2521,sv,"Any t- , any team that , tha , where the owner would fire Tom Landry , you know , is like one of the greatest coaches of all time ."
162201,sw2897,sv,but I would think they would get a much greater turnover
206110,sw3411,sv,they have been .
104956,sw2938,sv,"So , maybe that 's part of the reason it 's not so bad down here ."
159127,sw2526,sv,it 's just such a huge expense
169806,sw2868,sv,"You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy , too ,"
75160,sw3155,sv,I thought that might be kind of fun to do .
64667,sw3443,sv,it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country .
46285,sw3104,sv,"Uh , but I really think it 's important to put these children someplace where , in addition to , you know , them getting an education , they really need a , you know , a socialization away from what they are raised in ."
76875,sw3811,sv,"-- and I think this is b- , really --"
82499,sw2131,sv,"and , uh --"
121577,sw2027,sv,"I get things done faster , than when I 'm in a dress and heels , you know ,"
208039,sw2759,sv,"And , you know , the , the problem in the work place is that , that people are ,"
24911,sw2623,sv,"Well , it puts a strain on everybody , your wife and your family ."
5162,sw3233,sv,"I think that , uh , we , we ,"
114220,sw2431,sv,"so really if your sitting in the back seat , your better off not not to have your seat belt on , if it 's just a seat belt ."
177385,sw2062,sv,"And it 's probably not a great investment ,"
15983,sw2953,sv,"I mean , you know , I , I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the children of today ."
210263,sw2370,sv,"And so , basically no one was taking the responsibility --"
111654,sw3097,sv,and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people 's responsibilities .
47765,sw3457,sv,it 's what 's happening in the families .
156528,sw3360,sv,"Uh , sometimes when I hear what , what they 're , even what , even what the politicians are making , you know , when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that , uh , I think that 's just a bit too much to be paying them , uh ,"
151968,sw2012,sv,"It would , it would be pirated"
147583,sw3784,sv,"As far as capital punishment , I think that , uh , ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment ."
24259,sw2471,sv,"There 's really a disparity between the , uh , what a e- , I would call civilization of the countries , you know ."
104035,sw3049,sv,The characters played very well off one another .
5377,sw2981,sv,I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen .
174048,sw3040,sv,"so I 'm no- , I 'm , uh , think that the , we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that , uh , for Texas"
73319,sw3750,sv,"but it 's , it 's a lot like camping ."
172202,sw2330,sv,"Not , not a real in depth topic , but --"
121574,sw2027,sv,but I am more productive when I 'm in pants .
145250,sw2641,sv,"you ca n't take them for a walk ,"
50380,sw3151,sv,"I , uh , I think if somebody 's not on drugs , they have no reason , you know , to be afraid of it ."
51247,sw2576,sv,"T V watching has sure has n't gone too much out the door because T V is still , well ,"
106792,sw2450,sv,"and I thought it was pretty normal ,"
162209,sw2897,sv,"I mean , sure , the payroll is lower that way ,"
4864,sw2711,sv,"Of course , you have n't lived until you have been to San Antone , to the ,"
168459,sw2826,sv,"uh , you know , they 're constantly ,"
137985,sw3870,sv,and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it .
114727,sw4147,sv,"we suspect that he was hurt in an accident , you know , got away from somebody traveling through , and hurt in an accident --"
163680,sw4858,sv,"a , a , the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who 's good and who 's bad"
204482,sw3174,sv,I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it .
169568,sw3238,sv,"so , I do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor ."
199506,sw2628,sv,"There is n't going to be any of this , you know , very few people will ever stay home ."
116126,sw2424,sv,"Well , I think too ,"
61834,sw3746,sv,Lessons are expensive though .
14973,sw2709,sv,"Oh , that 's really sad ."
148587,sw3236,sv,"so , I guess we 're old timers compared to some people ."
41203,sw2234,sv,"There 's something about , um , the industry in the state ,"
106039,sw3557,sv,"It 's what many people have done already , who were just less famous ."
156491,sw3375,sv,And they do n't know a lot about that .
157100,sw2571,sv,"I think it 'll only make them worse ,"
191331,sw3075,sv,But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer
169126,sw2316,sv,"I just think it , it 's , it 's a duty of the parent to do that ."
175092,sw2970,sv,"And I do not think , I do not know , I think today a lot of parents , um , are ruled by their kids ."
150262,sw2956,sv,"But I mean , but --"
157184,sw2571,sv,"if I do n't think see , if I do n't believe that there 's not a character change and the authorities agree , that this person needs to be excused , I believe for murder , uh , rape , I even believe incest , things ,"
115661,sw3030,sv,"And it 's really , really kind of a neat thing to do ."
189053,sw4329,sv,They seem to be having a real good response .
158956,sw3663,sv,"I , I thought the fall was really nice ."
63679,sw3523,sv,more women in upper management
144169,sw2249,sv,And it 's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things .
54959,sw2175,sv,"and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad ,"
26644,sw2064,sv,"It 's a tough , tough question ."
45357,sw3642,sv,"because health care insurance for , for everyone is skyrocketing"
180051,sw4792,sv,"And it 's like the , the truth is n't really important anymore ."
10414,sw2768,sv,"You know , they feel like they 've lived life"
66846,sw3294,sv,"Uh , you know , it invades my time ."
29792,sw2854,sv,"Uh , it 's just , you know , it 's so low"
180066,sw4792,sv,people do n't want to take responsibility .
51760,sw3025,sv,"So , it fills you up"
45755,sw4615,sv,the interest is so low .
140987,sw2178,sv,this is kind of neat .
115574,sw2085,sv,I know we could .
79417,sw3638,sv,"Uh , football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world ."
64052,sw4363,sv,"You know , it 's all , it 's all money now ."
8172,sw2534,sv,"Well , if nobody , yeah , if nobody complains you 're all right ."
86764,sw2302,sv,"and if ,"
189389,sw2395,sv,I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably does n't .
115889,sw2620,sv,"I , I think our experience of camping is ,"
82274,sw2724,sv,"I mean there are some people ,"
23127,sw2621,sv,"that , that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game ."
157456,sw2407,sv,"And I keep thinking , you know , it 's not , it 's really not too late at any point to do , you know , some- ,"
186983,sw4325,sv,take a long time to find the right place
165995,sw2231,sv,"he 's just there to serve his time , and get back out on the street ."
209749,sw2305,sv,"I mean , they , they find out whether , just how much of a people person they are ."
56341,sw3185,sv,"you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat , because they 'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we 're melting ,"
10845,sw2090,sv,"but , um , I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes"
202019,sw2477,sv,"they just did n't seem , they seemed to think they were better than everybody else"
173638,sw4113,sv,"the world does revolve around D C , you know --"

7771,sw2232,sv,"Still have a problem with , uh ,"
71927,sw3680,sv,"But as it was , the politicians ran the , the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing ,"
19222,sw2543,sv,It 's kind of sad that I 've let that slip away .

3255,sw2614,sv,"I think it was Campinas ,"
138525,sw2713,sv,"But I think that was an actu- , actually a good thing that happened , uh , I never considered it , I guess , it 's an invasion of your privacy"
115236,sw2887,sv,"I mean it 's just , it 's that mind-set ,"
204185,sw2406,sv,A lot of those are really violent type movies .
73770,sw2092,sv,once a year you go out
105347,sw3012,sv,and they abuse that .
7824,sw2232,sv,"Uh , the communists are the , all alleged democrats . Uh ,"
15736,sw2953,sv,You just assume .
32004,sw2205,sv,"And I think ,"
79628,sw2130,sv,"I think that is a , a positive thing for them after , um , uh , thousands of years ,"
71931,sw3680,sv,"Uh , as I understand it , and I , uh , do n't know a lot about it , uh , we got in there because of France --"
160791,sw2262,sv,"Well , um , individual companies and things are so selfish ,"
179548,sw3015,sv,once you find the doctor that you like it 's not a problem .
214522,sw2611,sv,"but that , I mean , that can really benefit ."
204172,sw2406,sv,"and it 's a matter of your taste , uh ,"
80771,sw2121,sv,I notice locally a major problem is Kodak .

97126,sw3697,sv,"and I 'm sure that any of them would have cost al- , or charged me almost the same amount ."
37749,sw3346,sv,"because that 's one thing that 's hard , with young people , you , you ca n't tell them how things are --"
173611,sw4113,sv,but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up .
107748,sw2992,sv,"and I think maybe with DALLAS , as far as , they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first ."
164998,sw3727,sv,As long as you do not have to drive in it .

145681,sw4565,sv,But I do n't think it 's too good .
52117,sw3709,sv,"And it also builds too much mass if you just , you know ."
166310,sw2784,sv,"fees that , that fund these things , I guess that 's trickled down to the states"
177531,sw2062,sv,"Uh , and , and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one"
138369,sw2713,sv,That was a good one .
113958,sw4080,sv,well I know how you feel .
10052,sw2716,sv,and they need that .

208099,sw2759,sv,I guess so .
158030,sw2241,sv,"but , um , it looks like it would hold the soil"
115650,sw3030,sv,"and I mean all guys , I think , like to barbecue ."
166111,sw2231,sv,"Some of the things that would make sense to , to tell the jury , that this , this guy has a , a prior cri , criminal history , you know , where he 's raped ten women --"

169498,sw3238,sv,"-- I do n't , I do n't think that you can have , I mean , there 's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be --"
90245,sw4603,sv,More --
48122,sw2744,sv,"You know , kind of like the Bermuda Triangle ,"
165883,sw3206,sv,"I do n't know why we are so complacent ,"
164328,sw2436,sv,Ten years ago was n't so hard to stay up .
35069,sw2957,sv,"But I think you put your finger on it , when you said that they 're not respected if they do n't work , because it seems to me that a lot of people I know , women I know , are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense , certainly financially --"
122655,sw4752,sv,and then they shoot someone else
118891,sw2537,sv,"and , uh ,"
160308,sw2427,sv,It would be handy .
177193,sw4886,sv,That 's a lot easier .
166023,sw2231,sv,"There 's should be , you know , this , for this crime , this is the penalty ."
18627,sw3379,sv,"I think the problem is , you know ,"
19549,sw2355,sv,"And I think , you know that ,"
94105,sw2877,sv,"Oh , well , at least you know you did your part ."
103117,sw2197,sv,But what you do n't forget is the growing up .
96971,sw2314,sv,"and , and it 's --"
182135,sw2554,sv,"And then , uh , we , we go on from there"
184062,sw4319,sv,so that 's kind of a pain .
195221,sw4378,sv,but --
127133,sw2952,sv,"If you are doing a lot of things , sometimes you have conflicts ,"
80933,sw2121,sv,I mean I guess you could take those off too
66574,sw2521,sv,"You know , they could n't even take handoffs ."
183493,sw4048,sv,"Um , well , they must ,"
132983,sw3095,sv,"And , uh , that 's not the idea ."
161720,sw2820,sv,"You know , if you 're , you 're drinking or on drugs or whatever , you 're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands ."
40343,sw2954,sv,The cleaning up can be a mess .
82319,sw2724,sv,"That 's , uh , motivating ."
110883,sw3805,sv,and --
12854,sw2776,sv,"If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that , it works out fine ."
162180,sw2897,sv,"And , and , maybe arriving late or something like that , you know ,"
168336,sw3068,sv,"Oh , go , in going to school , you get taught the things you learn in school ,"
50866,sw4735,sv,"-- and then when they get out , they ,"
112304,sw2519,sv,We 're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager .
49003,sw2446,sv,"like sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things , Americanism , um , consumer products , T V , the whole works ."
23131,sw2621,sv,"but , they 're retired , you know ,"

45213,sw2578,sv,"it seems like , uh , older people have much better , uh ,"
103245,sw2197,sv,"Uh , so they p- , they , they want , you know , they want the best"
9553,sw3597,sv,-- I think it was too extreme .
67622,sw2383,sv,"I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people , you know , special interest groups can blow up ,"
92319,sw2676,sv,At least we found something different .
191622,sw4336,sv,it could still happen then .
206715,sw3161,sv,"The AIDS issue is , is a bit of a problem ."
146621,sw3269,sv,I think they 're doing pretty well this year though .
196797,sw4688,sv,They do n't like to be absent before a vacation .
106831,sw2450,sv,"so it 's real hard to ,"
3335,sw2614,sv,"and , uh , uh , so they 're not exactly business men ."
132501,sw2663,sv,"but those are the ones that are complaining , I , I think , a lot ."
109944,sw3283,sv,So --
147885,sw4902,sv,"But , uh ,"
86845,sw3150,sv,we can have a debate .
210069,sw2370,sv,at least for a lot of women --
102095,sw2549,sv,I guess we 're on .
183045,sw4358,sv,"and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably , believe it or not , is just to get the extra nickel at the , uh , the store and not , uh ,"
153059,sw4784,sv,And one is education for civilization .

137956,sw3870,sv,"It is just a matter of , uh , time and mistakes"
163740,sw2653,sv,But I think you you really hit the nail on the head .

35487,sw3272,sv,"And even in that situation , uh , the , it seems like to me from what I 've read in , in the history of Russia and , and you know different authors , uh , there has always been a paranoia ."

182152,sw2554,sv,And there 's a big difference .
173152,sw3417,sv,"I guess this does n't really have to do with taxes but just money in general , and , and , um , wondering if you 're going to have enough when you retire to live on ."
154185,sw4720,sv,Especially in this day and age .
181847,sw3633,sv,"Well , uh , I guess if they 'll replace them , then they assume they should n't have broken ."
14684,sw2342,sv,and it 's going to be worse .
182145,sw2554,sv,"I mean looking at it from the Am , the American public 's standpoints , they do n't understand the Middle Easterners ."
86662,sw2657,sv,"I mean , and that 's not really the answer , I mean , because if they 're alcoholics they 'll just go out and spend ,"
9007,sw3956,sv,That might be a step in the right direction .

193192,sw3156,sv,it just really was n't worth it .

160103,sw2427,sv,you can have it come on just early in the morning .

42010,sw3454,sv,"I mean , that 's tough ."
157264,sw2571,sv,"I feel like that might be better , if it was run on a more scriptural basis , which would include , you know , you know , and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with ."

207344,sw3796,sv,There 's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for .
155380,sw2488,sv,"Well it goes all through the st- , it goes all through the state supreme court system before they 're ,"
145703,sw4565,sv,I guess that 's not a big surprise .
59344,sw3692,sv,The Gramm Rudman Act did n't solve the problem .

157169,sw2571,sv,"we 've just been taken out from under , under a law ."

25730,sw2898,sv,"and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points , you know , MUMBLEx hundred twenty-two , you know ,"
56148,sw4745,sv,It 's a little bit financial type thing
48630,sw2149,sv,"I , I , I 'd force them ."
187273,sw4345,sv,"One of the things that I found interesting last year during the , uh , the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against , uh , Peter Arnett , who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting , uh , some of the things that were available ."

54135,sw2780,sv,there 's there 's always that difficulty

82291,sw2724,sv,"it 's , it 's , it 's , it 's pretty good ."
73950,sw2502,sv,sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that .
119544,sw2797,sv,"but , you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off ."
101905,sw3254,sv,or you go you know --

126748,sw3736,sv,I know we use them for trash can liners and --
175524,sw2331,sv,"You know , it 's , it 's pretty nice and friendly out there --"
189790,sw4340,sv,"and , and it decreases the prison population ."
117851,sw2514,sv,"that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray , because that does affect that things , you know , in your background ."
185592,sw4362,sv,"It 's , it 's a complicated issue ."

116205,sw2424,sv,I do n't have any idea .
121696,sw2452,sv,They get so much of our money from oil anyway .
189281,sw3902,sv,In Colorado it 's interesting .
152242,sw2171,sv,That 's like forcing someone to donate to a charity .
63712,sw3523,sv,We just function differently .
72476,sw2295,sv,"-- but then , you do n't want to go do that when you do n't have to --"
126539,sw3464,sv,it 's great .
68426,sw3333,sv,"-- it 's just , you know , another killing ."
164680,sw3334,sv,"And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing ,"
58875,sw3121,sv,they do n't do as much .
118803,sw2900,sv,"I mean , it does ,"
9866,sw2716,sv,You do n't get those .
148645,sw3236,sv,"I feel guilty we do n't recycle our , our milk containers because they seem like a big waste ."
59613,sw2344,sv,"and , uh , given the , the , uh , military powers on both sides , I think it 's always a threat ."
146845,sw3303,sv,It 's a little early .
112030,sw2104,sv,You ca n't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well .
14916,sw2709,sv,"You know , I , I , I think there 's something about being able to , to claim , um , imminent danger"
133119,sw2301,sv,"But , you know , the instant thing may be , may , may be the way of the future to , you know , to replace checks and every other thing ."
21471,sw2929,sv,and I think they should be voted on by the public .
85894,sw2421,sv,"And I think , personally , the drastic step has to be that , um , that you ca n't work if you continue taking drugs ."
33084,sw3057,sv,There has to be consideration taken on everything .
186830,sw4626,sv,It 's one of the problems .
205290,sw3476,sv,I think so .
141286,sw2221,sv,"It might be more ,"
186470,sw4617,sv,"and if not , you know , do n't , do n't let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years ."
191377,sw3075,sv,"And it , it is a beautiful country ."
161722,sw2820,sv,"And then if you 're a computer operator and , uh , there 's really no big deal ,"
153144,sw4130,sv,"and , uh , I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level , you know , rather than just in the places where it 's , you know , where it 's predominated so far , because it 's , you know it 's --"
55618,sw3518,sv,"and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun , if that five day waiting period were in effect , you would n't be able to purchase one at that gun show ."
151301,sw3062,sv,"and it 's interesting to see them as they get older , uh , then that is the type of adult they are ."
140132,sw2570,sv,Well that takes all the work out of it .
139182,sw2630,sv,"-- and it 's , it 's , well , it 's a little bit , I do n't want to use the word wilder , that 's not the word I want . Um , more diverse ,"
194862,sw4129,sv,"I think that 's one reason we have problems in schools , uh ,"
23474,sw2959,sv,and I think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times .
67272,sw2260,sv,"but I do n't think , uh , anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they 've been messing it up for many years , now ."
813,sw3426,sv,"I think that 's why a lot of people go to see him , though ."
28510,sw2924,sv,"that , that , that , that , that 's , that 's the way it works there , um ."
42660,sw2839,sv,"Well , it 's so much money"

6454,sw2308,sv,"It 's really , it 's a bad thing ,"
114360,sw2431,sv,"it 's , it just practically do n't get any ."
187193,sw3876,sv,Then we will be forced to .

26615,sw2064,sv,"maybe it just depends on , you know , how closely the crime , you know ,"
183734,sw4380,sv,I think it 'd be interesting --

122318,sw2071,sv,"I think they have a really good , uh , quality ."
31867,sw2205,sv,and it was interesting that they think that they 're basically impartial .

15467,sw2707,sv,you 're just going to have to talk to it --
118796,sw2900,sv,"The young people are n't getting the proper care that they need , and nutrition , I think ,"
147047,sw3103,sv,"So we have to , uh , face that reality also ."
109539,sw2313,sv,"It 's , it 's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car ,"
8185,sw2534,sv,"You know , you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property ."
69310,sw2617,sv,"Yo- , you have to support the people that are there ."
101468,sw2710,sv,"So , I mean , it 's , it 's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards ."
173029,sw2525,sv,"You know like people that are in prison , I mean we did n't put them there ."
70741,sw2460,sv,"Well and that , I think that 's maybe part of it that , that the , um ,"

167137,sw3041,sv,"they sort of candy coated the western story for many years ,"
28871,sw2834,sv,"and , and that , I think has been the downfall of the last ten years ."
20554,sw2812,sv,"And that , that has to do with , you know , the women getting out and other women seeing , uh , women seeing other women , you know ,"
25522,sw2991,sv,"And you have to , you know , be familiar with it ,"
147202,sw2490,sv,"I , I just think it makes honest people more honest"
148018,sw3636,sv,"Well , I guess that 's God 's place , too ."
47687,sw3457,sv,"It 's an adjustment to make , also ."
51571,sw2610,sv,"You got to have , uh , six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars ."
75994,sw2334,sv,That 's the way they suck you in .
98711,sw2275,sv,Which of course he needed .
45723,sw4615,sv,"but as the years go on , if you 're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better"
35506,sw3272,sv,and there might be a revolution within the people .
147328,sw2490,sv,"I think that 's a lot of it too , is that people need to teach their kids ,"
108003,sw2065,sv,"You wonder if being exposed to that for a while , what percentage of them would actually say , Hey , that 's not a bad way to do it ,"
183095,sw4358,sv,"Well , part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper ."
76641,sw2365,sv,"because it , uh , it seems like everybody has a , you know , to go in and do ,"
162205,sw2897,sv,"the- , they should be able , they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are"
62559,sw2499,sv,He 's a very good writer
105655,sw2962,sv,I mean it would be --
57561,sw3694,sv,I know --
37724,sw3346,sv,I agree with you .
18748,sw4703,sv,"I think clearly , the person who is the line own- , the line manager --"
123986,sw3065,sv,So all the dieters would be happy .
185390,sw4108,sv,And you need a special nursing home for that .
156578,sw3360,sv,"but there 's probably at least about twenty-five to , to thirty cents of different taxes on , on our gas ."
196667,sw3133,sv,"but I think by the time they 're , oh , early teenagers anyway , I think it 's too late now . At least around here ."
183359,sw4133,sv,"So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say , well , the problem is you , you 've got an endorphin imbalance"
94214,sw2602,sv,"Actually , they 're showing remarkable restraint ."
109985,sw3283,sv,We really have .
157383,sw2407,sv,Maybe there need to be some radical changes made .
104038,sw3049,sv,"but the story was a very dramatic story ,"
201545,sw3140,sv,"Um , I think that , and I think that involves social changes a lot ."
127779,sw4927,sv,"and when someone is say , out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they 're not committed to huge amounts of debt , that 's the best time to be able to do work that does n't pay very well ."
126545,sw3464,sv,"and , uh , uh , it 's a really good show ."
48551,sw3734,sv,that is cute .
205176,sw2708,sv,"But see , that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people . At people , per , at high school level ,"
127030,sw2952,sv,Seems like sometimes hobbies do that .
153395,sw2669,sv,"but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages , you know ."
154734,sw3345,sv,"-- but I think the quality of our , uh , our news is just , uh , I do n't believe it could be better --"
511,sw2278,sv,"-- uh , uh , you know , I guess , I guess when you start pitching real well , well , move them up . Bam MUMBLEx ."
146805,sw3303,sv,"But , I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again ."
133260,sw2387,sv,It 's funny .
4438,sw2168,sv,"I know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school , then it 's like they 've lost so much ground , we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up , reteaching what they had the year before . You know ."
85368,sw3367,sv,But there 's a greater chance that he 'll be back out on the streets in twelve years .
79747,sw2324,sv,"and if I have a hard time , you know --"
5299,sw2981,sv,"Well , Cathy , I think that , uh , capital punishment certainly has a place in our society , um , maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just ca n't afford to have repeated , even in the remote chance of repetition ."
64437,sw4691,sv,"I think that , uh ,"
149793,sw2587,sv,"I 'll bet that was the case of the , the war in the Middle East ."
85325,sw3367,sv,They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years .
127866,sw4927,sv,"When in doubt , do n't trust the government at all ."
126641,sw3464,sv,Sometimes you 're in the mood for it even .
51170,sw2576,sv,"and , um , I , I guess they would , would be more conservative , some of them I guess ."
43038,sw3009,sv,And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you do n't ask a whole lot of questions .
37100,sw3270,sv,"but , uh , during that time I 'm sure there 's hundreds of , uh , thousands of people that are , uh , spending money that does not belong to them ."
157250,sw2571,sv,"and it was really an integral part ,"
186710,sw4321,sv,"Well , I was , I was , uh , originally chosen primarily , I think , because I was a young fellow"
147858,sw4902,sv,And it would have nothing to do with political situations .
55655,sw3518,sv,not an Uzi .
22955,sw2621,sv,"but , I , you know , you could n't deny that ."
41130,sw2234,sv,"and that it 's mostly sales tax ,"
111884,sw2476,sv,"I actually think that I 'm , I 'm somewhat encouraged by that trend , because after all people live longer lives now ,"
85351,sw3367,sv,"it is a deterrent in the , in the sense that that person will never do it again ."
157157,sw2571,sv,"we do n't have speedy , um , punishment"
189298,sw3902,sv,It 's frightening .
29063,sw2834,sv,"It 's dangerous for the woman , too , to think that she can do that"
184934,sw4364,sv,it kind of makes you feel MUMBLEx from doing it again .
204019,sw3495,sv,"Well , I think you hit on one point there is you know each other ."
153049,sw4784,sv,The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter
201584,sw3140,sv,"like you said , I mean , there 's , they might be saving money ,"
213482,sw4175,sv,"The hostile planet , I think ,"
74387,sw2800,sv,"Especially , you know , if you catch yourself short on cash or if you 're on vacation ,"
58937,sw3121,sv,People marry later .
70871,sw4114,sv,"It 's not , not a real good one actually ."
117840,sw2514,sv,"you ca n't really tell ,"
23712,sw3214,sv,"and uh , you 're right , the leaves are beautiful ,"
78714,sw2053,sv,"Uh , they 're just too nice ."
4317,sw3433,sv,"I , I agree with you that they 're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren ,"
129954,sw2110,sv,"or it could be like the draft where , you know , before they draft you , they ta- , uh , you get a physical anyway ."
84713,sw2113,sv,"Oh , I thought it was awful ,"
28935,sw2834,sv,"in , in terms of that , I think we 've got more of a sense of humor about each other --"
74734,sw2445,sv,"you can talk about that a lot ,"
99,sw3743,sv,"it 's , it 's difficult ,"
75449,sw2870,sv,"they have to kind of take a stand on some things , like abortion and things like that ,"
153436,sw2669,sv,"but , you know , it 's like somebody said , okay as of such and such a date , you know , anybody caught talking in the English , you know ,"
120363,sw4707,sv,I guess that 's all right .
79578,sw2130,sv,"and we , uh , I think we over estimated it ,"
116158,sw2424,sv,"Well , another thing now they keep decontrolling different things ."
153881,sw2005,sv,"But , I guess as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation --"
88672,sw2336,sv,those were not good cars .
83672,sw2672,sv,we 've all got to do it right now .
89434,sw4728,sv,"That thing , that thing will last forever I mean ,"
161388,sw3693,sv,"-- um , it 's not the same ,"
16618,sw3136,sv,Oh sure I 'll be more then glad to pay him --
164251,sw2436,sv,you 're missing an awful lot .
140725,sw4840,sv,"I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it 's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to be , uh , as far as cash flow , a lot , uh , have be , tend to have a much slower cash flow --"
159197,sw2526,sv,and those are fun .
78045,sw2609,sv,"I mean if you look at the break down of those who do n't vote , they tend to be , you know ,"
183444,sw4048,sv,"So , it , you know , it 's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos ."
196897,sw4096,sv,"-- and , uh , I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days"
160854,sw2262,sv,Seems kind of old to me .
179013,sw3382,sv,"And they are doing it un- , you know , unconsciously ."
153172,sw4130,sv,"-- and , uh , I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand , you know , try to understand what they 're going through and everything and try to understand that --"
33092,sw3057,sv,"you would look into it thoroughly and ,"
27553,sw2723,sv,"you do n't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own , you know ."
107680,sw2992,sv,"and you know , they , especially boys , I mean , they 're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff --"
66849,sw3294,sv,And that just really does aggravate me .
163087,sw2874,sv,it 's a big problem .
13243,sw3500,sv,"If , if they have complications and ,"
62064,sw2597,sv,"And it , it 's just too bad that we could n't see that ."
133628,sw2235,sv,"It would n't be perfect ,"
194534,sw4619,sv,"And it seems , uh ,"
3972,sw2506,sv,no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much .
145791,sw4642,sv,They 're really good cars .
98563,sw3088,sv,"that 's , that 's just the way it is ."
111746,sw2476,sv,"it , it 's funny ,"
122654,sw4752,sv,and they 're back on the street
159146,sw2526,sv,something 's wrong .
9060,sw3956,sv,so --
35018,sw2957,sv,"my complaint would , would be , um , that I think that , you know , the kids in the neighborhood run wild ,"
118087,sw2575,sv,"they do n't have anybody to depend on ,"
41898,sw3181,sv,"Well , I think that 's great ."
63616,sw3523,sv,That 's changing .
197656,sw4831,sv,"but , uh , you know , sometimes you do n't get tuned in to what 's going on ."
196442,sw2095,sv,"Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics"
47662,sw3457,sv,"It was much , much harder when mine were young ."
67564,sw2260,sv,That 's been a real big plus .
55834,sw2983,sv,"You know , you can go to the country club together ."
131416,sw3063,sv,their little minds are like sponges
169849,sw2868,sv,"So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes ,"
213362,sw3142,sv,"Oh , that 's good ."
149396,sw3343,sv,"you , you pretty well know what you 're getting ahead of time ,"
11648,sw3841,sv,"I do n't think the teachers get enough support , quite honestly ."
62762,sw2499,sv,When they 're so cheap too at the video stores that you can .
7107,sw3019,sv,"anyway , so you might as well not ,"
126458,sw3828,sv,"and , you know , to , I 'm sure he gets to watch a lot of T V"
109847,sw2300,sv,"You know , there are so many rip-off artists here in this town ."
181565,sw4092,sv,Cause they look pretty rough .
19816,sw3001,sv,"but , you know , that 's not always a real , for sure kind of thing ."
121871,sw2452,sv,"Well I do n't think Iran is under the same type of madman type leadership ,"
7837,sw2232,sv,"I think socially , it really destroyed a lot of the people that , that went over and saw these people ."
135346,sw2661,sv,"and , and there 's big differences , of course ,"
174107,sw3040,sv,"Well , this , this is a thing"
106840,sw2450,sv,"and all the trees are pretty ,"
192290,sw3227,sv,"Well , that 's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes , too , I guess ."
11053,sw4721,sv,"It 's more motivating that way , I think ."
16796,sw2379,sv,"the perceived decline , has to do with , uh , um , the attitudes and the educational system , uh ,"
110502,sw2849,sv,"And they can make , as you said , uh , so well , the , a , a few can make it so miserable for everybody else ."
109361,sw3399,sv,"they just , um , make their , uh , circle and come back again ."
154894,sw2584,sv,"and , and I mean , there is just no way I 've not picked one up ."
207462,sw3838,sv,"Well , if you 're from Iowa , you must be very artsy crafty ."
112763,sw2380,sv,"Or if they would allow them to , uh , give broader answers , they ,"
126134,sw4917,sv,"Minivans d , do pretty well ."
123944,sw3065,sv,because I think our generation could make a change .
75105,sw3155,sv,I guess maybe it would have been better if we 'd have been at the theater --
211562,sw3925,sv,"Well , I suspect that it is possible ."
59798,sw2344,sv,"and I do n't think it 's that different from what the Baltic states are , are going through ."
104864,sw2938,sv,supposedly that 's supposed to catch it .
197870,sw2145,sv,"That 's okay , too ."
150916,sw3313,sv,"and it is really frightening , uh , to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety ."
25701,sw2898,sv,"He only has twenty , twenty-five , whatever hours he has to spend on practice ."
45644,sw3770,sv,"In fact , just , uh , just , uh , sit and chat with them for five minutes and , and be interested in what they have to say --"
51431,sw2610,sv,it is a mental thing .
172296,sw2139,sv,"but it 's the phone calls ,"
89628,sw3728,sv,"-- and then , you know , if it 's , uh , if they 're satisfied ,"
203889,sw2604,sv,"And if you look at history at all , you see that , you know , uh , we go from one side to the other on just about any subject ,"
147200,sw2490,sv,He 's going to do what he wants to do .
8438,sw2528,sv,"I do n't , I do n't see any difference though ,"
190166,sw4166,sv,"And , you know , even there you have to watch out for , you know ,"
111870,sw2476,sv,"the other big change I see in , in woman 's lives is , um , to remain biological"
92282,sw2566,sv,Now you understand .
96939,sw2314,sv,"Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries ."
73505,sw3586,sv,"Fifty-five gallons , you 'd hope it would never do that ."
59810,sw2344,sv,there 's more than one group fighting for the same place .
124881,sw2793,sv,we have .
114846,sw2887,sv,"Well , I think health care is real important , and dental coverage ,"
21262,sw2675,sv,"But , uh , like you said , it 's , it 's not the best system ,"
87680,sw2020,sv,"music is kind of in a weird , it 's in a very weird position right now ."
12930,sw2776,sv,"And a lot of the , a lot of the myths they 've been passing around , people are starting to realize are n't true ."
67280,sw2260,sv,"and I think that sometimes it 's too easy of a , I do n't know , to easy of an answer ."
95846,sw3235,sv,"I , I have a feeling we 're going to go more and more ,"
17836,sw3908,sv,and I think I see some change in attitudes there .
160457,sw2427,sv,"you do n't get , seem to get that much for the space ,"
62008,sw2597,sv,"we ca n't get involved in their civil war , um , unfortunately ,"
196931,sw4096,sv,Well it 's interesting .
184927,sw4364,sv,Whenever you donate money to someone ?
73627,sw2092,sv,you ca n't do that very often .
69817,sw3111,sv,"But , that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking --"
108791,sw2515,sv,I mean you look around
30772,sw2982,sv,"-- so it stands to reason they should really ha , have more benefits ."
57273,sw2237,sv,"and your , your , your neighbor gets them ,"
51372,sw2610,sv,"I think it 's interesting you we- , you know , when yo- , you go out there"
37777,sw3346,sv,"and , uh , you know , having that , that , uh , gung ho plan --"
166637,sw2860,sv,a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs .
162510,sw3662,sv,"I think it 's , it 's more frequent now ."
115566,sw2085,sv,"but , on the other hand , I do n't think it , you know , that someone that teaches , uh , say shop , for instance , should have to have degree at all ."
128535,sw2622,sv,I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits .
160608,sw3419,sv,If you want a really special night out and fish food --
119932,sw3926,sv,That 's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem .
198670,sw2061,sv,"Whereas if you try something different , they 'll --"
22103,sw2960,sv,He has to do something positive to help them .
55606,sw3518,sv,"and in the heat of the moment , they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people ,"
45155,sw2578,sv,but that one just sounded like gossipy .
55919,sw2983,sv,"you , you get a little taste of it"
183315,sw4133,sv,"and , there , there , they seem that the profit marg- , uh , drug dealers , the profit margin 's so high that , yeah --"
134058,sw2999,sv,because people think it does n't really cost them anything to pay .
162488,sw3662,sv,"and this is why , I mean , uh , drugs are the biggest problem , I think to face America today ."
90218,sw4603,sv,and you have to do a public service project .
212013,sw2107,sv,they do .
10415,sw2768,sv,so they need to share it .
128571,sw2622,sv,but instead I think it 's going to the wrong places .
94264,sw2602,sv,The situation down there is weird
145985,sw2253,sv,"You know , they were n't a state"
87722,sw2020,sv,"I mean , when you listen to it , it 's um , uh ,"
35135,sw2957,sv,"and in the past , maybe the same percentage got them ,"
183340,sw4133,sv,"I mean , my thought has been , once the guy has been imprisoned , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed , it should n't make any difference to the , uh , the victim 's family ."
74773,sw2445,sv,"it 's like , oh , my"
25845,sw2898,sv,"It , it 's , it 's real amateur sports ."
98780,sw2275,sv,and then they went away from it --
116301,sw2287,sv,or sometimes they do n't like either of the choices --
6136,sw2684,sv,"And for two people to be out in the world like that , I do n't , I do n't want them in my world ."
38064,sw2426,sv,because we just do n't want to send our people there and make them stay .
162050,sw3533,sv,"The only problem is , it keeps you pretty busy , keeping everything going ,"
142983,sw2405,sv,She could just as easily do those things by hand .
179374,sw2568,sv,"I mean there was n't any part of it that you really felt like , no , this ca n't happen ."
116380,sw2287,sv,the hours are good
159991,sw2427,sv,It 's cheap entertainment .
192776,sw2109,sv,It 's amazing .
194980,sw4646,sv,you ca n't always get in when you want too
66489,sw2521,sv,Because look how good we did without a quarterback this year .
211152,sw3821,sv,"I mean , it , it 's easy ,"
116224,sw2424,sv,"Well , I , I have another thing that I thought about too , for instance , when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is"
112242,sw2519,sv,"You know , during , when you 're sitting watching T V at night ,"
106767,sw2024,sv,I think it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk
205286,sw3476,sv,"but even if it 's english , they should just have one ."
206853,sw4519,sv,"Well , that , that 's a system too ."
166520,sw2860,sv,"Uh , but it has been , um , it 's been interesting and particularly I , I think because the society in which we live , families are separated ."
162924,sw2921,sv,it 's real nice .
10182,sw2768,sv,"And it 's like , it 's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just , uh ,"
116022,sw2620,sv,"That 's neat ,"
41930,sw3454,sv,That 's social change .
150253,sw2956,sv,and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance .
185438,sw4108,sv,"I , I think , I think the , uh --"
19002,sw2543,sv,"and it gets kind of old ,"
132524,sw2663,sv,"I think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead ,"
41737,sw2942,sv,"It certainly means that we do n't have to experience everything ,"
185840,sw2945,sv,"it 's really nice , uh ,"
147568,sw3784,sv,And you 're the minority
104964,sw2938,sv,But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially .
157048,sw3052,sv,but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there
148500,sw4154,sv,"That just seemed to me to be a , uh , a phenomenal , uh , demonstration of restraint ,"
117831,sw2514,sv,and that 's pretty of heavy duty .
90261,sw4603,sv,"and they , they at least have , now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline ."
71945,sw3680,sv,"You know , before she , before Jane Fonda did , did what she did , I thought she was a wonderful person ,"
181784,sw2896,sv,If you do n't like it all you do is put on another coat .
49927,sw2862,sv,They 're consistent .
52276,sw2803,sv,"I would think that for , like people that are just filthy , filthy rich ,"
207640,sw3146,sv,It really is a great place .
47450,sw2830,sv,"you hear about something that somebody else talked about ,"
149860,sw2587,sv,"and he 'd have all these people jumping down his back , even though I 'd agree with it ."
61979,sw2597,sv,"Now I would , now me not even knowing anything about Houston , I would think that it 's a pretty calm city ."
208770,sw3801,sv,"and I think ,"
36925,sw3061,sv,They say MUMBLEx ruined them .
106658,sw2024,sv,Wonderful touch tone telephone there .
199628,sw2628,sv,"I think you 've , you 've earned that though ."
69990,sw3539,sv,It does make you feel better .
170951,sw3045,sv,"it 's , uh , Wordstar was never very intuitive to me ."
33393,sw3198,sv,"I , I think that 's , the gap is coming closer a- , as , um , what I 've learned in , uh , just , just being out there ."
123591,sw3092,sv,"I think any , any , even if your insurance policy is not the greatest ."
198019,sw2028,sv,"Well , you are not from that area originally , I can tell ."
212730,sw2018,sv,I think that would be a wonderful way to do it .
154720,sw3345,sv,"I think it 's pretty darned good ,"
149656,sw4812,sv,They are n't that sensitive .
48058,sw2744,sv,"I guess today that would be , uh , some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing ,"
160914,sw2262,sv,"And it 's also , it 's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer ,"
197471,sw3467,sv,There 's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that .
2762,sw2038,sv,"and we stole it fair and square ,"
23155,sw2621,sv,"But that just may be , you know , perceived ,"
183285,sw4133,sv,but --
143755,sw2157,sv,"And the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb- ,"
171169,sw2790,sv,"um , ther- , there was n't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and ,"
49281,sw2228,sv,but I feel likes it 's on an individual basis .
205581,sw3595,sv,"it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND , I guess --"
12460,sw2594,sv,"Uh , but that does n't mean that they do n't ."
194293,sw2451,sv,"and I guess that 's where Yeltsin steps in , so far as his politics of government goes , uh ,"
41187,sw2234,sv,they 've earned it .
56408,sw2227,sv,"Oh , he just , like , totally sarcastic and hilarious"
175312,sw2970,sv,They should have been in there longer .
71356,sw2041,sv,"They do n't have that perfect look ,"
72196,sw2840,sv,"you ca n't really expect that parent who 's , quite frankly --"
107832,sw3196,sv,"I just find it so easy to , to charge something when I do n't have the money to pay for it ,"
214377,sw3887,sv,It 's a lot of waste
156593,sw3360,sv,"but they changed the , uh , deductions on you ,"
210715,sw3138,sv,"I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really , kind of gives it a --"
85327,sw3367,sv,That they are going to write a book .
72335,sw2840,sv,"I mean , they 're manipulated by their children ."
85963,sw2421,sv,"because it makes a bigger problem . Um ,"
189864,sw3086,sv,"I guess it 's twenty-five ,"
64435,sw4691,sv,"It , it 's good as , in terms of , in terms of , uh , of a contest ."
141604,sw2448,sv,"So I , I do n't think they are too ,"
38948,sw2968,sv,"I , I guess that is a , tha- , that is a source of reading ."
122708,sw4752,sv,"I mean like even , even going to the grocery store ."
119600,sw2797,sv,and it was great .
8885,sw2354,sv,"I mean , she 's , you know , she appeared to me to be very petite"
12772,sw3815,sv,"and actually it 's probably safer on , you know , at long trips because it keeps you more active ."
186725,sw4321,sv,"But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly , I think in civil cases ."
14996,sw2709,sv,"But in , in the long run maybe that 's going to make a better world too ."
99587,sw2226,sv,it is .
140980,sw2178,sv,"people like us , you know ."
82809,sw2503,sv,"Well , you do n't own cats ."
3900,sw2506,sv,"Because they 're always ,"
43190,sw2767,sv,That 's the best status .
81841,sw2441,sv,we 'd learn service to other people --
54873,sw2175,sv,"Well that 's it then , I think ,"
164610,sw3334,sv,"We , we do n't know , half the time we do n't know who to support ."
30866,sw2794,sv,and really receive some revenues from .
118729,sw2900,sv,"And , uh , I do n't know exactly how we 're going to cover many of these people , because I 'm sure that some of them do n't , uh , do n't have the wherewithal to do it themselves ,"
98552,sw3088,sv,that 's enough to make anybody paranoid .
196238,sw4333,sv,"so , uh , I know the politicians , uh , are n't , are n't straightforward ."
57519,sw3694,sv,but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home --
112791,sw2883,sv,"The other thing , I , I think if you do get overextended a little bit , you need to be sure and pay it off , uh , more than one at a time , because I think you could run forever paying what they require ."
146799,sw3303,sv,"Kind of like the Cowboys , I guess ."
201871,sw4765,sv,"Uh , and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that , uh , things like drug laws seem to come and go ."
35006,sw2957,sv,"I mean , there 's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the , if the wife is going to actually be a mother ."
154013,sw2154,sv,"Well , Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold ,"
34613,sw2293,sv,"-- and , with , uh , I guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff , that would have a lot of air pollution in it ."
153663,sw3541,sv,"And , uh , I guess if people got thirty , forty thousand bucks to spend on a car , uh , that 's their prerogative , you know ."
10935,sw3985,sv,"Even though they did n't bring it in , they help it once it 's there ."
42782,sw2839,sv,"we need to get , try to get hold of it and , and have it be , things be honest"
181998,sw3284,sv,But it should be if it 's not .
96018,sw4876,sv,"and that is sometimes what some women who have to work , that is all they can afford ."
22487,sw3788,sv,"Well , I know that when you 're in a smaller community ,"
90357,sw4071,sv,"and now that they are voting and people , you know , getting into MUMBLEx drug and that stuff ."
54173,sw2780,sv,what the stan- flag stands for I guess to me is
147961,sw3636,sv,it has to be .
49838,sw3167,sv,"and you have to rack your brain ,"
62560,sw2499,sv,"and he had a way of putting you in that scene , you know ."
29790,sw2854,sv,"One of the things that is a problem is that , uh , in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers ."
180100,sw4792,sv,"there are too many big problems , you know ."
15434,sw2707,sv,"but here in Dallas it 's , I think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed , and Johnny Pecanseed , whatever you would call it , you know ,"
128007,sw3556,sv,"well , it 's , uh , you know , it was the time for the passing of the guard , I mean ."
96122,sw3387,sv,"The , the first one is we need people in there that , that understand , uh , numbers . The numbers that are being thrown around when , when we 're talking in trillions of dollars ."
121000,sw2187,sv,it 's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party .
144326,sw2249,sv,I believe we are .
17847,sw3908,sv,"If they chose not to , that 's acceptable ."
116438,sw2287,sv,and try to determine if what you read was objective or not .
81875,sw2441,sv,"and , and there 's probably , there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy ."
42393,sw3751,sv,"Between Mart and Marlin , they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour ."
191386,sw3075,sv,"And , uh , it 's , it 's just , it 's just a gorgeous country ."
151734,sw2589,sv,He had just as much dirt on him as anybody else .
7845,sw2232,sv,"and I think that if anything , that , when MUMBLEx he was saying the idea that we learned , we l- , we learned a lot from Vietnam --"
43209,sw2767,sv,"And I think that 's sort of unfortunate ,"
182561,sw4649,sv,"but , uh , not everybody can make that choice"
114851,sw2887,sv,"compared to what we , our salary is --"
205236,sw3476,sv,"but , uh , I sense that it 's not going to happen anytime soon ."
114807,sw4147,sv,"And , uh , so that is not as good , uh , you know ,"
78704,sw2053,sv,Those are pretty .
92236,sw2566,sv,It is scary .
128237,sw2122,sv,they have really simplified things .
5095,sw3233,sv,-- and that was not enjoyment .
173617,sw4113,sv,"Uh , but maybe standardizing on , on a , a four year term for Congress --"
80313,sw2151,sv,"but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country ,"
83247,sw2703,sv,"And the Mavericks are t- ,"
111259,sw3368,sv,It really is .
21187,sw2675,sv,"well , I think pride in our country and our flag is so important ."
184923,sw4364,sv,"But it really makes you wonder what other lists you 're own that have been made , uh , public that you ,"
51786,sw3025,sv,Sometimes it blows up anyway .
37039,sw3270,sv,"and it hurts everybody 's pocket , of course ,"
36657,sw2457,sv,"and , it feels good"
183978,sw4366,sv,And --
24188,sw2471,sv,"We have n't had too much ,"
187167,sw3876,sv,Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage
140481,sw2690,sv,"And then there 's other ones that , uh , deal with , uh , in a funny manner , uh , socially relevant things ."
193970,sw3707,sv,"and , you know , you do n't want to , you do n't want to spank it or scare it , or anything like that ,"
152327,sw2171,sv,"So , it is something that I think , uh , you know , even the larger organizations will support ."
141980,sw3002,sv,"and then they devote , uh , an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind ."
201049,sw4890,sv,"With everybody with that mind set . They , they 're --"
141279,sw2221,sv,"And a lot of jurors ,"
42781,sw2839,sv,you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be .
186986,sw4325,sv,"and you , and you do n't always even know if it 's , it 's going to be the right place or not ."
122152,sw2181,sv,"and there 's always something that , uh ,"
212763,sw2018,sv,"so I think that 's real nice too , to come up with different options ."
92212,sw2566,sv,You get some kids in there
86060,sw2479,sv,and --
161710,sw2820,sv,"and it 's , it 's , it 's , if it 's not affecting someone 's performance then I 'm not sure if it 's a problem ."
49508,sw3028,sv,"Oh , catfish is wonderful ."
131028,sw4605,sv,it is a problem .
177160,sw4886,sv,It 's probably more there .

10005,sw2716,sd,"but in effect , I 'm paying twice for one service ."
132835,sw4443,sd,"-- I mean it 's , uh , it 's a lot more exciting than actually w , than watching it on T V ."
104529,sw3373,sd,"And we really have n't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current , uh , especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here ."
58430,sw2467,sd,"and then , uh , then there 's the ones that you never know anything about ,"
63585,sw3051,sd,"And you ask the right questions and can research ,"

136493,sw3000,sd,"it 's good stuff , you kno ,"

191576,sw4336,sd,"uh , a strange case that , uh , that happened , oh , it 's about , about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine ."
164174,sw2436,sd,"And we do n't have any kids yet ,"
183751,sw4380,sd,"If you compare the , like the people that could have , that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that , you know , the people that , uh , did send their kids to private --"

23982,sw3769,sd,I just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese --
211022,sw3169,sd,and you paddle your way back in and hope it does n't start raining on you right away .
19191,sw2543,sd,it 's hard to explain .
122506,sw3384,sd,"The thing is , when a woman does work , then there is the clothes to buy ,"
113417,sw2969,sd,"But when I come down here , everybody told me they are flags ."

43246,sw2767,sd,"this , it 's a big engineering school"
122136,sw2181,sd,and the older generation is not needed

110617,sw2849,sd,"Um , and I always , that always bothered me"

89457,sw3728,sd,"I sometimes watch T V if I ,"
141049,sw2221,sd,But then there 's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six

93279,sw2828,sd,"Uh , also , I 've alw- , I 've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the ,"

89395,sw4728,sd,"uh , I would consider going to a , a non , to a normal pickup rather than a , a covered pickup like the one I 've got . Just because there 's a lot of times I wished I had , ju- , just an open bed to throw stuff in ."
164930,sw3727,sd,"So , it keeps them busy ."

103098,sw2197,sd,"me being one person with a above the median income ,"
63468,sw3051,sd,"And I think somebody told me it 's also on a creek side lot , heavily wooded off the golf course ."
136514,sw3000,sd,"Um , we do n't hang around with them , because usually it 's , you know , ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that ."
78708,sw2053,sd,"She said , I know she does n't get to touch it ."

32222,sw2432,sd,"We take them back , you know , and use the ones that we have ."
103554,sw3666,sd,-- and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds

89022,sw2565,sd,"And , uh , that guy MUMBLEx , the short stop , is going to be good ."
86251,sw2479,sd,and they have weekly meetings and everything
168028,sw2111,sd,"Because , I do n't mind doing that ,"
76266,sw3124,sd,"I mean , I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago"
48611,sw3734,sd,My parents keep the house cold .
94263,sw2602,sd,"they 've got a screwed up situation , I 'll give them that . From Mexico all the way down into Cen- , Central and South America ."

1346,sw2296,sd,"like I 'll be really tired ,"
175484,sw2331,sd,"And then I got into it and then back out of it ,"
6554,sw3189,sd,that 's wonderful .
3378,sw2614,sd,"and they 're , they have n't had , what , that much luck in South America"

167951,sw2111,sd,"I know you do yours at work ,"
53400,sw3046,sd,So they 're not too much into beef .
186893,sw4626,sd,"So , so that 's , I think , one of the reasons I do n't need to budget is that I do n't have , I do n't , I do n't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I ca n't afford it , because I 'm not interested in that expensive thing ."
168153,sw3068,sd,"In fact , I 'm still going ."

139232,sw2630,sd,we went
64799,sw2782,sd,"well , we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina ."
213516,sw4175,sd,-- it will be whole .
5011,sw4799,sd,she can
3077,sw2125,sd,"actually I , I grew up water skiing ."
127165,sw2952,sd,"And I never have ,"
104495,sw4723,sd,"But it all dried out , you know . Did n't --"

175727,sw3288,sd,I do n't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is
100203,sw2397,sd,but I did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves --
180148,sw2627,sd,"My husband is really good ,"

160467,sw2427,sd,"I got to wait for a place to , to , to free up ."

77295,sw3074,sd,"And yet , you know , and we were just sort of talking about it at the time ."
132898,sw4443,sd,"I guess they have those , uh , driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other ."
25604,sw2991,sd,"and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it , that just a basic , general user can understand them ."

163908,sw2691,sd,it 's --
130700,sw2751,sd,I would n't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford .

8387,sw2528,sd,and the other half the time I just ignore it
116863,sw3096,sd,"Because , I know that there , now there , they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles ."
26982,sw2821,sd,so he heats us up a good fight
206784,sw3161,sd,"but , the other thing that I thought of on this is , I wonder if there is n't enough money , uh , in our economy or in our system ."
214100,sw3188,sd,"and the guy said , Oh , get this , it 's a nice shiny gloss , which was true ,"
64276,sw3525,sd,"and we play three days in a row , three different courses"
150356,sw2956,sd,It was on the news every night .
79289,sw3342,sd,"but actually catching fish to eat per se , you do n't really do much of that right there ."
175505,sw2331,sd,"And then , you know , we 've got some guys here that they are , you know , four and five handicappers --"

118654,sw2766,sd,-- and to some level even Russia was behind .
128848,sw4759,sd,and it does add up .
1732,sw2325,sd,and --

142648,sw3646,sd,"Uh , overall on campus about twelve hundred , but in the upper school , upper four grades , uh , about four hundred and something"
106308,sw2806,sd,and when we got him a new one it was brown

66240,sw2913,sd,It was a different movie from anything I 've ever seen .
173353,sw3354,sd,and we did n't know the difference .

172674,sw3085,sd,it did n't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school --
125889,sw3791,sd,but the whole group goes out hunting

181283,sw3067,sd,"and at time , you know , they all knew one another ."
23722,sw3214,sd,"The other thing about magazines , the only thing I do n't like , is they really get heavily into advertising --"

25435,sw2495,sd,"I do n't even know if I , you know , I would not even recommend this person again to anybody ."

209049,sw2548,sd,me either .
197686,sw4831,sd,"But , uh , but basically , uh , there 's lots of things that , that we should know about projects ."
21215,sw2675,sd,"That 's what I was thinking they , they sometimes do ."
72680,sw3691,sd,"in fact my brother has a , uh , a exotic pet shop out in California ,"

134142,sw3039,sd,"Uh , my daughter and her husband work Saturdays ."
20957,sw3102,sd,I have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it

173906,sw3607,sd,I do n't know quite how that works .
139006,sw3234,sd,"-- and I realize it 's my fault ,"
2952,sw3034,sd,"And so I was always throwing my arm out and , uh ,"
184612,sw4346,sd,"you know , you can come to south Tyler where I live"
133917,sw2999,sd,"And I said , well , I mailed you a check"
28298,sw2101,sd,Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something .
167427,sw2469,sd,so they 're a little bit angry at me .
202389,sw3242,sd,"because it does , you know ,"
27670,sw2723,sd,I shall look into it .
67160,sw4618,sd,but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff .
150273,sw2956,sd,And he is the president
22490,sw3788,sd,"-- and , uh , when we have , uh , a local election , say for our mayor and so forth --"
114740,sw4147,sd,"-- and in my , in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a , a good friend of mine"
88829,sw3159,sd,so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am .
57049,sw2237,sd,"and ,"
70481,sw2792,sd,and he was telling me about it .
32327,sw2432,sd,So she 's into this .

7322,sw2244,sd,Chicken fajitas and stuff .
1004,sw3426,sd,It was very difficult .
101796,sw3254,sd,and we can have a salad bar --

204966,sw3427,sd,"The pa- , the paint 's peeling off of it ,"
38157,sw2692,sd,But --
16520,sw3136,sd,They had no right to live .
22541,sw2353,sd,-- and I think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home --
15897,sw2953,sd,"And so we , we 've been all over"
107161,sw3473,sd,"Well , I tell you , I , I firmly believe in exercising ."
1386,sw2296,sd,In Santa Barbara .
67217,sw4618,sd,because they say they can spot check .
63855,sw2177,sd,"I do n't , I do n't like Stephen King ."
167718,sw2615,sd,"And , uh , boy that was , uh , really a mess back under there under the , in that van ."

70461,sw2792,sd,a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail .
207253,sw3796,sd,"Billy Owens looks like he was ,"

187992,sw4353,sd,"I work at a , for a university . Uh , Georgia Tech , uh , research --"
109723,sw2300,sd,One of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through G M A C or something .

175896,sw3215,sd,and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure .
152847,sw4483,sd,"Which , in the paper , it 's just , uh , newspaper and corrugated cardboard ."
34547,sw3647,sd,"and there 's , uh , there 's some different things , uh , one that you 've already mentioned is , is health insurance ."
8431,sw2528,sd,and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program .
138981,sw3234,sd,-- and she 's just turned out to be a jewel .
17158,sw3319,sd,"Now , my husband and all the men , I mean , they love the real competitiveness of playing for money , you know ."
116671,sw3131,sd,"and we 'll say , wait a minute ."
104558,sw3373,sd,"I have n't gotten ,"
159584,sw2466,sd,I 've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college --
40187,sw3280,sd,And so we had the T V on

207178,sw3349,sd,"and we 'd stay in people 's homes ,"
180372,sw2627,sd,"we always , we had that bread that was , uh , um ,"
10235,sw2768,sd,"and there are a lot of other churches ,"
62498,sw2499,sd,"I , I just finally ended up going to see it , uh ,"
37310,sw2562,sd,"I mean , it was terrible ."
140465,sw2690,sd,"Well , there 's water in the Trinity ."
76765,sw3811,sd,our first
139587,sw3087,sd,"and he went to New York with them ,"
115277,sw3804,sd,"Uh , and I had help with them ."
139504,sw3087,sd,and then she played bass clarinet during concert band .
25178,sw2889,sd,if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out .
103569,sw3666,sd,I have n't gone back over there .
90429,sw2366,sd,"I grew up , uh , in the , the sixties ,"
15369,sw2707,sd,"-- sometimes they do essentially nothing ,"
38465,sw2692,sd,"I , I told my daughters in college this year , I said , This summer we 're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car ."
175874,sw3215,sd,It was real gray --
146618,sw3269,sd,And we kind of got spoiled .
3206,sw2614,sd,well sometimes I 'm home
93618,sw3195,sd,"and I really just keep very good records ,"
135845,sw4856,sd,"and , uh , I , I ju- , I , I 'm probably one that has to agree with it too ."
7116,sw3019,sd,"my parents were a lot like , too"
209867,sw3862,sd,and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group
132444,sw2663,sd,"Of course they have absentee which is getting to be more , a lot easier ,"
146724,sw3269,sd,but they did the Johnny Angel .
41374,sw3383,sd,"and , uh , in fact , just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car ."
18079,sw2303,sd,"At last , someone wants us to vote ."
20594,sw2812,sd,"I 'm , you know ,"
80742,sw2121,sd,"I live up in the , uh , northeast corner"

141352,sw2025,sd,there 's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that .

83665,sw2672,sd,"I do n't have any little tiny kids ,"
170894,sw3045,sd,"-- and we 're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing ,"
116414,sw2287,sd,I usually vote .
151822,sw2589,sd,And it really helps .
166483,sw2860,sd,"and my mother and I have talked about it , to how important it was when I came home from school ."
82378,sw2131,sd,"I played flute for ,"
92069,sw2566,sd,"I just hate that ,"
117947,sw3353,sd,"I guess they could call them that , but they 're , they 're more just a screened in , uh , camping area --"
16708,sw2379,sd,"at least in my own circles I 've been aware of an increasing from my generation ,"
110099,sw2268,sd,I would be impressed .

30600,sw2982,sd,"and so the insurance would cost lower ,"
108565,sw3359,sd,"and yet , we have n't , as human beings , have n't figured out a way to harvest it economically --"
130206,sw3036,sd,"it 's tough , uh , I think I would just stick with the classics . Only because , uh , I like music just for music 's sake"
45296,sw2578,sd,"I mean I sometimes get hooked into it ,"
187297,sw4152,sd,"and that is , uh , and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race . Uh ,"
212916,sw2772,sd,And I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days .
148402,sw3300,sd,I had no idea that he was like that .
115623,sw2085,sd,I make more than my boss . Because he 's salary and I 'm not .

113846,sw2847,sd,I know .
113109,sw2579,sd,"And , uh , so this little dog has plenty of room to run ."
78871,sw4633,sd,they stash away a good bit of money and come down here
75933,sw2334,sd,"Well , like I told you before , MUMBLEx ."
3005,sw3034,sd,"And I thought , no ,"
144191,sw2249,sd,"and we would n't mind going its extra effort to do it . Uh ,"
189972,sw3086,sd,"I 've never tried using that ,"

24036,sw3244,sd,just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations
87303,sw3130,sd,"because when the kids first went down , I said , that , you know that 's great"
52908,sw2339,sd,"Oh , they turn them over to somebody"
200097,sw2729,sd,"so . I named her Rosebud ,"
130420,sw3371,sd,"so it 's not , um , what you would find , uh , where you live ."
78246,sw2609,sd,"And the whole idea was , um , presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person , and , and , a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy ,"
212587,sw4868,sd,"And , and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge . Along with my trip to Japan --"
202400,sw3242,sd,I never --
194437,sw4349,sd,"but , uh , I 've , I 've had considerable experience ."
33132,sw3057,sd,"And he has , I would say , he adjusted very well"
144434,sw4032,sd,"Well that sounds , you sound just like my husband ."
31544,sw3527,sd,that 's what they do .
189333,sw3902,sd,She lived by herself .
200493,sw4079,sd,and I put it in parenthesis .
143613,sw3286,sd,my sister just had a baby
65210,sw2533,sd,"so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian ,"
69669,sw3111,sd,"-- Unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals , there are more policemen --"
157422,sw2407,sd,"and , uh , I was just absolutely shocked , uh , the first time that I saw his schoolwork ."
203559,sw2837,sd,I hated to leave it .
180154,sw2627,sd,"And now , I went back to work about a year and a half ago"
36570,sw2457,sd,so that adds to it --
136128,sw3291,sd,"Matter of fact , if I find a , uh , a , a fly running around in the house , I pick him up and carry him outdoors ."
9044,sw3956,sd,"and , uh , it changes every year ."
97299,sw3403,sd,"I was from Illinois ,"
130541,sw3371,sd,it is .
65913,sw4023,sd,"-- but that was in a more of a , a setting where there was a number of people around ,"
17318,sw2191,sd,Think someone can do it .
71702,sw2220,sd,but there 's probably something else that might make you .
197738,sw4831,sd,"I mean , my , uh , brother-in-law is like , uh , I mean he 's sixty ."
212911,sw2772,sd,"It goes from Winter to Summer , usually ."
172322,sw2139,sd,"I actually during that period of time from , you know , usually from six o'clock or six thirty , whenever I get home , until eight or so , I will shut off the phone --"
86704,sw2302,sd,"Well , I think , I think basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition ."
112637,sw2380,sd,"but , I know , that , um , for a lot of the civil cases it 's rare ,"
67464,sw2260,sd,just two or three houses a week at the most .
24718,sw2623,sd,"but drugs is , in Texas , are extremely bad ."
133386,sw2387,sd,"but , um , even when I was pregnant , of course I listened to that ,"
29828,sw2854,sd,I 'm just real curious .
208019,sw2759,sd,"I 've ,"
207318,sw3796,sd,"So it 's , yeah , it 's not really a local , you know ,"
122991,sw2647,sd,"and I did n't really ,"
125739,sw3071,sd,"but we 've gotten to know each other quite well , um , in , on a , a social level ,"
29698,sw2854,sd,"Uh , issues are being raised prematurely in my mind ."
202929,sw2429,sd,But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled
57125,sw2237,sd,"But , uh , they 're kind of fun to , to try ,"
118472,sw4829,sd,She lives in Garland
124651,sw2963,sd,and we found what we thought was just an old water hole .
187969,sw4353,sd,Not too bad . Uh .
118551,sw2766,sd,-- Kuwait was the nonaggressor --
117920,sw3353,sd,"-- and , uh , of course , there 's lots of mountains around there to camp in , and , and streams and stuff ."
175220,sw2970,sd,"But I just looked at the picture and thought , what a world ."
30374,sw3852,sd,"-- I 'm , I 'm very much aware of that ."
126790,sw3736,sd,"it was nicer than Dallas ' ,"
29569,sw2854,sd,So he 's out of daycare .
17903,sw3282,sd,I guess the question in my mind somewhat
203626,sw2837,sd,"It 's just , they 're the most resilient little characters"
178567,sw2547,sd,"I 'm , I 'm only about , uh , twelve miles or so from the , uh , border of Washington D C , and Montgomery County ,"
192015,sw2789,sd,"but I want to start ,"
3764,sw3813,sd,"but I know that I go to the grocery store that we always stick within , you know , five dollars between here and there ."
100757,sw2832,sd,he really should have hired people .
98735,sw2275,sd,"I ca n't remember what her name is ,"
11974,sw4165,sd,"And that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to , maybe , seven or eight children ."
147357,sw2490,sd,-- or you ca n't get a deer license .
1124,sw2040,sd,and he ca n't speak a word .
182453,sw4682,sd,I did n't --
69711,sw3111,sd,it would certainly be an interesting test --
137765,sw3626,sd,and so I 'm into computers all the time .
180783,sw2667,sd,"Um , I started at the beginning of this year ,"
95099,sw2435,sd,"But normally we do n't think about it until ,"
147140,sw2490,sd,"Well , I 'm kind of leaning towards , I do n't know , I 'm thinking about what , from one to ten what my no would be ."
8681,sw3405,sd,"And , uh , for many years I grew sweet corn ,"
185041,sw4312,sd,"I 'm ki- , I 've kind of like developed a , a short hatred for , for pop ."
2590,sw2289,sd,"and I get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov- , and bring them over ."
114883,sw2887,sd,"more money , actually , um ,"
142958,sw2405,sd,"you can ,"
135490,sw2661,sd,West --
132640,sw3587,sd,and you do actually camp .
213940,sw3188,sd,"I helped someone repaint an apartment ,"
165639,sw2634,sd,"I resp , I respect them and what their capabilities are ."
58465,sw2467,sd,I have three left in the house .
186300,sw4153,sd,one time I picked up this little boy who was crying
24402,sw3231,sd,"Oh , you sound very young --"
118649,sw2766,sd,the Brits were there .
99754,sw2226,sd,DEAD ZONE .
97042,sw2314,sd,and the men that drive the trucks --
119278,sw3845,sd,"Well , you know , the only call I really got that , well , was out of state ,"
74459,sw2800,sd,"with the American Express card from T I ,"
12700,sw3815,sd,"Well , it , it see- , sure seems to save lives"
205416,sw3561,sd,"but , but taking what you 're saying at face value , then I would have to agree with completely ."
14865,sw2709,sd,"and there 's a lot of Mexican people too . Which is not , neither here nor there ,"
204957,sw3427,sd,and I hate it .
193209,sw3156,sd,I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time .
178491,sw2547,sd,"so , really housing is real bad ."
76521,sw2365,sd,"and they just said , oh , you can get by ,"
95530,sw2819,sd,but that may just be because I 've changed .
88341,sw4859,sd,"I wish , I wish we had something ."
54446,sw2879,sd,"and I know , because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference --"
62612,sw2499,sd,"and I could n't figure what was going on half the time ,"
94111,sw2877,sd,"And so she knew that I had the time and would be , would enjoy it ."
97471,sw3503,sd,and this guy is indicted on three of them .
126601,sw3464,sd,"my wife 's from down in that region around the s- , the , called the , the Seven Missions which are , which are right down in this , where I 'm sure where it was filmed at ."
202185,sw2477,sd,"Um . If they did , they 'd still have to pay his contract ."
141974,sw3002,sd,But they keep asking these questions
164727,sw4008,sd,"I am , uh , I 'm just starting to get into , uh , a little bit more communications now ."
182020,sw3284,sd,"And I have , have done , uh , gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society ."
7118,sw3019,sd,"kids have ,"
188787,sw4171,sd,"God , I do n't know ."
89115,sw2599,sd,"In a way that happened this past season ,"
60303,sw2773,sd,"Well , I , I have n't been to Beirut"
80616,sw3756,sd,We are just not willing to get up that high .
51918,sw3363,sd,"Most of the time when I do n't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work , you know , and then fill it up ,"
14252,sw2930,sd,They have some wonderful camping areas there .
108239,sw3537,sd,"he says , well , I think this is what it is ,"
34876,sw2373,sd,"Oh , I could n't even tell you ."
91844,sw3148,sd,It may not in all ways .
87321,sw3130,sd,"The other thing he does , that my husband a real stickler about is we do n't collect our grass clippings ."
180330,sw2627,sd,And I 'm not really that great at it
44739,sw4655,sd,"Because if you were n't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing , they could , they had freedom to just walk around"
114942,sw2887,sd,"but , um ,"
130530,sw3371,sd,Seventeen years .
51262,sw2576,sd,"they love to sit in front of the T V ,"
184434,sw4028,sd,"But overall , um , I 've been pleased with it over the years ."
161259,sw3332,sd,"Well , I think we 're narrowing it down , actually ."
67173,sw4618,sd,it did n't cause her any problems with her job
42365,sw3751,sd,"They have , uh , uh , a place , I guess that would be similar to Prime Air ."
53839,sw2155,sd,and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life .
178601,sw2547,sd,"I ,"
42089,sw3716,sd,so I thought that would be easy for me to make
172615,sw3085,sd,"And he said , Mom , do n't do that to me ,"
181423,sw4092,sd,"or they have on Saturday night , Friday night and Saturday night --"
185750,sw4330,sd,"and everybody there , you know , are all software engineers ."
79237,sw3342,sd,"He said , I do n't think that 's the different kinds of fishing they 're talking about ."
36215,sw2389,sd,she 's very old fashioned .
109744,sw2300,sd,and we were young
83589,sw2672,sd,"but ,"
191474,sw3445,sd,DIRTY DANCING and CROSSING DELANCY are two of my favorite .
210925,sw4099,sd,so that 's why I 've kept active in that way .
124908,sw2996,sd,"I think that , uh , we probably will have to have , have to , uh , have a state income tax because , uh , Texans do n't approve of such things as lotteries , uh , well I , I , come here from New York"
200430,sw4019,sd,"So , we 're kind of country but not too ."
86702,sw2302,sd,"I think that 's , that 's a good way to do it ."
159422,sw2035,sd,and the kids can pet animals and stuff .
159307,sw2526,sd,they 're not really that bad
200811,sw3441,sd,"So , uh , I used to deal with ,"
25693,sw2898,sd,"because , I mean , Purdue , even though they 're one of the few schools that really , uh , stress academics , they 're suffering , you know"
154080,sw2154,sd,"Oh , I 'm with you ,"
72211,sw2840,sd,and this is something that I see .
135451,sw2661,sd,"One of our other real problems with going out to eat , Sunday morning brunches ."
171222,sw2790,sd,"So , you know , I do n't know it 's , I do n't know that that trend 's going to change the single parent type families"
189194,sw3902,sd,She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town
39704,sw2935,sd,They certainly enjoy that part of it .
199618,sw2628,sd,"I mean , it really does ."
159005,sw2526,sd,"and it got wrecked ,"
64483,sw4691,sd,there 's a team in London
96072,sw4876,sd,"and then , in addition , I paid a little bit extra ."
172684,sw3409,sd,"Um , I think I 'm down to one ."
97082,sw3697,sd,and --
139497,sw3087,sd,And then in concert band I played the bass clarinet .
199683,sw4123,sd,"I take away a , uh , addiction ."
58732,sw3310,sd,"We put her in another one that I , I went a couple of times --"
212321,sw3080,sd,"and , um , I play racquetball ,"
38414,sw2692,sd,"Well that , that 's what ended up being the real problem on this , was the , uh , i- , the , the pipe was n't busted ,"
20470,sw2812,sd,"I do n't have the numbers in my head right now ,"
182400,sw4682,sd,"something was very , very wrong with the blade ."
153064,sw4784,sd,That 's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor
170302,sw4347,sd,"Uh , I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just , I really did n't want it ,"
145348,sw2641,sd,"and I got her when she was , you know , just this tiniest little thing like ,"
190560,sw4148,sd,"but I 've never actually even made it into the , the jury box ."
187211,sw3876,sd,"So , I still throw away a lot of glass ."
50083,sw2862,sd,"but , uh , it , it was only like a couple dollars to get in"
55173,sw3624,sd,"Um , but we do get an awful lot of music , you know ,"
174191,sw2304,sd,so you can make a barbecue .
76823,sw3811,sd,They 've got three daughters .
176071,sw3246,sd,"And , uh , he 's pleased with his classes ."
213004,sw2772,sd,"we had lived out , um , west of San Antonio , in Castroville ,"
26083,sw2967,sd,and I thought it was good .
89268,sw4728,sd,and I kind of like having a pickup truck .
211330,sw2060,sd,"and I can remember being in , uh , in these earthquakes"
201877,sw4765,sd,"Well I think , uh , the dr- , the laws on , uh , uh , uh , the first morphine laws were , were like ninety , or nineteen ten or nineteen five , something like that ."

83994,sw2465,sd,"sometimes he bri- , he brought home a , uh , a portable one ,"
117225,sw2642,sd,"but I do n't like using them because I 've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on ,"
51422,sw2610,sd,"It , it 's , like I say , I work in a machine shop"
5182,sw3439,sd,and those are only available at T I .
36458,sw2457,sd,several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day --
40046,sw3280,sd,"Uh , mostly from T V too ."
177103,sw4886,sd,You can always tear stuff out and redo it .
202863,sw2429,sd,"shrimp , shrimp fettucini is real easy --"
123307,sw2482,sd,"and I thought if I do that , I might not have a job"
186677,sw3351,sd,"and like , our cats never went outside ,"
62268,sw3317,sd,So it 's worked pretty well .
25723,sw2898,sd,"Any basketball that I like ,"
27373,sw2723,sd,I 've been getting mine .
41498,sw3204,sd,-- I have to say that .

117136,sw2105,sd,they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though .
147997,sw3636,sd,"And , course , the , the Sequoias and the Redwoods and , and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone"
127913,sw4927,sd,"Uh , my husband works for , uh , Texas Instruments ."

167171,sw3041,sd,"I mean , if you do n't mind reading subtitles ,"
98459,sw3660,sd,"it 's , it 's before ."
181087,sw2247,sd,Word processing obviously .

214220,sw3324,sd,"lot of time spent with her ,"
33224,sw3276,sd,because no financial gains are available for doctors .
188221,sw2184,sd,"and finally , the day we declared war was my time ."

64922,sw2782,sd,"our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions , um , you know , is to ,"

82616,sw2131,sd,"I took them up here to Collectors Rector- , Records and was able to get a little money for them --"
138613,sw4940,sd,"At that , it 's pretty easy to do ."
103911,sw3504,sd,"but , I just do n't understand ,"
159408,sw2035,sd,I guess there 's Science Place One and Science Place Two .

125531,sw2631,sd,"and ,"
139079,sw2630,sd,and it was a very difficult choice
76212,sw2334,sd,"I mean , uh , a lot of people use human factors ,"
120636,sw4675,sd,But I only get that once a month .
6778,sw3253,sd,"I used to live abroad ,"
32721,sw3016,sd,"I ca n't really think of anything that invades my privacy ,"
87509,sw2020,sd,"I , I do , I do listen to a lot of ,"
171028,sw3045,sd,so --
6427,sw2308,sd,"And , as the years go on , the tow trucks got better , more easier ,"
109531,sw2313,sd,"and , but I agree with you --"
103737,sw3408,sd,"but it 's probably going to take me longer , because I did n't decide to major in that until , uh , about a year and a half after I was already in school ,"
210031,sw3251,sd,"And , when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house , there were no trees --"
103764,sw3408,sd,-- it was about twenty-six to one .
102267,sw2549,sd,"the Baltimore Sun has this , uh , cartoonist in the sports section"
200376,sw4019,sd,"-- you know , I saw something on C N N or on cable here --"
164729,sw4008,sd,so I 'll be able to --
137183,sw2006,sd,I 'm familiar with that one .
110819,sw3190,sd,Uh --
73607,sw3586,sd,"I also , I play a couple of instruments ."
62517,sw2499,sd,I mean it just --
129301,sw4905,sd,"and it 's already dark unless it 's summer time , you know ."
184302,sw3073,sd,"and , of course , the town thinks he 's just terrible , because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he 's broken it ."
129869,sw2736,sd,I know my brother does n't
32482,sw2884,sd,That 's true .
157791,sw2442,sd,"So we , when we go , we have about , do about fifteen miles a week ,"
161068,sw3451,sd,The Methodist Church in Richardson .
41668,sw2942,sd,"and , uh , and that sort of forced them ."
161236,sw3332,sd,"We try hard ,"
103403,sw4149,sd,I 'm a sophomore .
197731,sw4831,sd,"And the , the , the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open"
85127,sw3069,sd,"Well , I read that ,"
154600,sw2603,sd,Because I jump on the bike here at home .
185228,sw4628,sd,"Well , I , I work for , uh , actually probably similar kind of place ."
63274,sw2545,sd,"but , but then we have n't needed to either ,"
83996,sw2465,sd,"but , uh , it , it quit working"
187897,sw4353,sd,You do n't spend it .
103475,sw3666,sd,we 're supposed to talk about lawn and garden .
100294,sw2397,sd,"So first thing I think of is how easy would this ,"
48865,sw2149,sd,"And , you know , he and his wife just went off to visit her"
136580,sw3000,sd,"I mean ,"
4063,sw2506,sd,It was already setup when we bought it .
160518,sw3419,sd,"it 's where Skillman , uh , curves into Forest Lane --"
129566,sw2926,sd,"Because when Georgetown was number one ,"
100696,sw2832,sd,"for that you put ,"
91059,sw2818,sd,"But the thing about the child care I , you know , I have friends that struggle financially and , and they both do have to work ."
118272,sw3056,sd,"I would I would like to , too ,"
177915,sw2658,sd,"and they were very happy with the system ,"
76200,sw2334,sd,"It 's , well , it 's more psychology and engineering ."
136877,sw3050,sd,"I think I 'm going to like golf MUMBLEx the older I get ,"
189257,sw3902,sd,but basically people kind of have a small apartment
93001,sw2598,sd,"the , the title sounds familiar ,"
26706,sw2064,sd,If it finally gets to that point .
201325,sw3883,sd,"Of course , we wear , uh , an unlined boots , you know ,"
140047,sw2570,sd,"I , I do have two daughters that , you know , out , they 're , they 're grown now though ."
124646,sw2963,sd,and the old people can not take it anymore .
29527,sw2854,sd,"so I do n't really have a lot of , uh , concrete , uh , opinions ."
25138,sw2889,sd,"and I use , um , the graphics --"
110107,sw2268,sd,"I 've , I 've seen it , uh ,"
39067,sw3170,sd,"but we , we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us ."
212376,sw3080,sd,I 'm doing that more and more than I used to --
119536,sw2797,sd,"I remember when I was in school , I did horrible up until about ,"
79266,sw3342,sd,and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing .
110756,sw3190,sd,"and we left a day early ,"
61024,sw2423,sd,"I , I almost want to start a business doing it ,"
189058,sw4329,sd,"and I know in the state we were from that they did that t- , similar type thing ."
142347,sw4050,sd,It went pretty good .
3827,sw3813,sd,-- and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it .
119871,sw2283,sd,"but you just , when you walk up to them they 're covered with thorns ."
185820,sw2945,sd,"and , um , I have one son who 's almost sixteen months old ."
206835,sw4519,sd,"Ac- , ac- , actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we 've moved to California"
44407,sw2950,sd,we are just beginning .
122346,sw2071,sd,it gets excellent gas mileage .
41128,sw2234,sd,"we live here also ,"
143870,sw2157,sd,"that they 're structuring it with ,"
137936,sw3681,sd,"but there 's a lot of people that , uh , you know , are band directors at schools , or have been ,"
110313,sw3449,sd,"oh , I , I did n't really know that ,"
84879,sw2527,sd,"So , it 's pretty nice ."
651,sw2741,sd,"A few ,"
39577,sw2935,sd,my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall --
103801,sw3408,sd,"It 's kind of , you 're on your own ."
129362,sw2926,sd,"High schools , I 'm not too sure ."
1585,sw2325,sd,"So I , well , I had been sick"
101067,sw3364,sd,and then Jan Hooks has taken Charlene 's part .
43596,sw2263,sd,He 's about a year and a half younger .
190568,sw4148,sd,"Well , the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that , you know , after initially finding out where people stand , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is a , you know , something like a nine , three or , or more severe and , and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they 're right --"
84126,sw2465,sd,"you know , it 's not something that 's continual because , you know , the television ratings do n't come out , you know , all the time ."
189339,sw2395,sd,and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends .
152625,sw3524,sd,"I mean , I do n't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen ."
119842,sw2283,sd,"and the landlord cut it down and said , Yeah , that 's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it does n't rub up against the siding --"
100169,sw2397,sd,And it 's real neat .
125346,sw2631,sd,"but not many people can afford ,"
165837,sw2634,sd,That 's the kind of training I 've had .
124768,sw2793,sd,"Some of the people that have been involved with Peace Corps , among other things , were retired teachers ."
186501,sw4617,sd,"And , uh , they 've only deliberated four hours or ,"
33445,sw3077,sd,"I do n't know of any other state , um , does not have a , a state income tax --"
116406,sw2287,sd,"but , uh , my mind has gone blank ."
125738,sw3071,sd,"I think that 's , well , that 's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much , is that not only do we sing wonderful music ,"
176123,sw4697,sd,It 's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V .
106274,sw2806,sd,I 'd get lettuce at the store
174180,sw2304,sd,"well , we got , um , a lot of , uh , European dishes ."
898,sw3426,sd,They liked it .
133719,sw2235,sd,"We already have new bills printed , for ,"
143166,sw2405,sd,and when we were in high school it was always fun .
68564,sw3497,sd,"my husband got his doctorate at B Y U ,"
4696,sw2711,sd,"It 's , it 's a beautiful drive ."
128670,sw2622,sd,"I , I guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something ."
171268,sw2439,sd,"but it 's been , uh , a demonstrator model --"
119723,sw2283,sd,She likes to really get into her pumpkins
171822,sw3237,sd,"-- you know , so , uh , that 's worked out good ."
134223,sw3039,sd,"-- and , uh , I think because she is , uh , the only child that they concentrate , uh , they would like to have more ,"
67449,sw2260,sd,"And when we bought this house , we looked at doing a fifteen year note , because it added more to the payment ,"
16455,sw3136,sd,"and , and they look real pretty after the rain ."
43823,sw2995,sd,So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
189701,sw4340,sd,"that , that , that is a crime ."
101202,sw2073,sd,"I 'm always amazed at that , that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him , you know ."
181041,sw2667,sd,"It 's also got a full insid , inside basketball court ,"
89275,sw4728,sd,I like the way trucks are built
177095,sw4886,sd,but we did n't do that way .
214559,sw2611,sd,"I mean , I always thought my mom was being mean to me"
211978,sw2107,sd,"and he said he was probably weaned too young , which he was , because his mom was killed ,"
64211,sw3525,sd,"I think , I think I played better golf when I was fifteen , John , than --"
117748,sw2514,sd,"They do n't allow people to move in , like less nations , you know ,"
119053,sw3898,sd,"I 've se , I think I 've seen it around ."
200793,sw3441,sd,"Um , but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using"
160583,sw3419,sd,It 's a lot of cajun food and --
25941,sw2967,sd,"The oldest daughter , they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of ,"
120794,sw4726,sd,"There 's too many sports people out there that , that do do these things ."
113292,sw2969,sd,"we are about to hit it in ten , few minutes ."
206600,sw3682,sd,"and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan ,"
86572,sw2657,sd,"and but actually they 're , they 're pretty good ,"
166778,sw2866,sd,"But in , but in the afternoon , uh , I try to read"
71163,sw2041,sd,"or ,"
207373,sw4880,sd,"after , I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test ."
187388,sw4152,sd,"and then , oh , there 's we have these , we have people wondering around to- , with petitions trying to get the judge ,"
29366,sw2292,sd,sometimes it can be .
138926,sw2086,sd,"and it 'll say you 've over extended your conversation , you now have fifteen minutes to compl , fifteen seconds to complete it ."
196743,sw4688,sd,and we kept that going for about a month
186239,sw4082,sd,"Uh , I do n't you know , but I do n't usually ."
123621,sw3092,sd,"basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care ,"
165368,sw3296,sd,"And that 's right outside of ,"
75255,sw3425,sd,"We 're getting up in age , I guess , in our late thirties"
170234,sw3655,sd,"just , I did n't feel like she was mature enough socially --"
214127,sw3324,sd,They like to be outside as much as possible .
21956,sw3255,sd,"in Minneapolis itself , because of so many people on the highway , there is becoming a problem of pollution ,"
188185,sw2184,sd,and --
147089,sw3103,sd,but it 's just really interesting to me .
162707,sw2921,sd,they paid fifty-eight for it .
169316,sw3099,sd,and there 's something about their eyes .
104524,sw3373,sd,"and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake ,"
146650,sw3269,sd,And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays .
163614,sw4858,sd,"On the other hand , uh , the more I learn about the history , the more I see it was incremental , uh , decisions . Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time ."
186936,sw4325,sd,"I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit ,"
91006,sw2818,sd,"and they , you know , had done such a good job ."
72263,sw2840,sd,but they were n't great .
197240,sw4877,sd,Called her
21523,sw2929,sd,"Uh , cause that 's the first I 've really known anybody that , you know , works for somebody that they had that option , you know , to make the choice --"
132110,sw2185,sd,"-- and we put a flat over the top ,"
137010,sw3050,sd,"I have this nasty habit of MUMBLEx of turning my head at the last second , or ,"
96489,sw2851,sd,"But , my family usually goes with me ."
22496,sw3788,sd,"-- and , uh , and then they have , they raise a , they raise two sides"
104309,sw4056,sd,"But it pays , uh , a substantial amount ."
140766,sw2178,sd,"he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house ,"
54110,sw2780,sd,The
187372,sw4152,sd,"I do n't know if it 's , it 's got , it 's got as much notoriety"
193368,sw4127,sd,"so , I got rid of them credit cards ."
70263,sw2792,sd,MUMBLEx working a lot of hours at work
149013,sw3983,sd,I like that .
68693,sw2645,sd,"I enjoy playing basketball and , and basically all kinds of sports ."
26850,sw2821,sd,"but ,"
6310,sw2308,sd,"So , um , well , I 'll tell you , my situation is , uh , I have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home ."
142152,sw3020,sd,"you know , it , it 's a little scary too when they 're coming up and they 're all over you ."
62483,sw2051,sd,"Well , she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute ,"
111336,sw3651,sd,"and , and , the router , uh , helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router ."
192508,sw4168,sd,I also like jazz .
164574,sw2266,sd,"She 's more into the animated stuff , where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing"
168209,sw3068,sd,"because I , I actually teach college ,"
89198,sw2599,sd,they 're mean
139733,sw2376,sd,"And , uh , Plano has plans"
82624,sw2131,sd,"and when they would come and change the records the guys would , the guy would give her the old records --"
15876,sw2953,sd,"But now , we are trying to go back to about the sixties , when the parents , you know , when the mother was staying at home ."
68692,sw2645,sd,"I guess , uh , I , it 's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing ."
36492,sw2457,sd,"So , I 'm hoping , you know , that ,"
65392,sw2533,sd,What I mean how to train them so they 're going to be a blessing
2148,sw2788,sd,"He 's ,"
175858,sw3215,sd,"I mean , it did n't foul one launch ,"
164056,sw2691,sd,"So it 's , uh , it 's sort of home now ."
1556,sw2325,sd,But she came to our house
212609,sw4868,sd,"Two , you know , two new pieces in the ref- , in the family room and new carpet ."
17166,sw3319,sd,"I do n't do much with it since , uh , most of theirs ,"
59090,sw3489,sd,I 'm building our house right now
179319,sw2568,sd,but see I do n't really like Sylvester Stallone .
127524,sw2726,sd,"and they we moved in when they were brand new ,"
136545,sw3000,sd,and you eat your crawfish and --
18223,sw4788,sd,When you have a small child because they do n't want to get up at three in the morning
33204,sw3276,sd,we 've --

137822,sw3626,sd,"you get programming , a fair amount of programming ,"
140860,sw2178,sd,"I even like some , I mean , some of the original stuff ,"
202495,sw4150,sd,I came from a family of five .
180931,sw2667,sd,"And then just in general , I sleep a lot better --"
21040,sw2675,sd,"Well , Jean , the subject is jury trials"
192562,sw4168,sd,"I , I went to school and got a degree"
187742,sw3135,sd,And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals .

101155,sw2073,sd,"I do n't know ,"
147373,sw2490,sd,put the safety on the gun .
142115,sw3020,sd,so I do n't remember that

88344,sw4859,sd,"I think it was , somebody was just scarcely just , just ripping the hell out of someo- , another person ."

124032,sw3065,sd,"I mean , we are , of course , we are Americans"
109856,sw2300,sd,and he 'd already been paid by a cashing firm .
145012,sw2372,sd,or I 've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer . The one that 's on the network or my own .
38829,sw2968,sd,"and she would have to come home at night , cut out different ,"
40779,sw3455,sd,It was really sad .
56577,sw2227,sd,And so we just woke up
180696,sw3311,sd,"And it 's , it 's kind of nice being up here just because it 's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go ."
198562,sw2061,sd,That 's why you want to join .
189699,sw4340,sd,"I mean it is a crime ,"
161704,sw2820,sd,"Um , I , I also have n't thought too much about it ."
193028,sw3580,sd,"I , I , I worked on some of it at T I --"

165557,sw2717,sd,"I kind of , uh , stopped listening after a while ."
63016,sw2455,sd,"And I mean , I still , unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night ,"
101974,sw3245,sd,so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind .
97836,sw2648,sd,"it really frightens me though as far as the , when you think about the , you know , thinking of just air pollution itself"
99892,sw3093,sd,and we did not have a chance to do that .
3202,sw2614,sd,"I , uh , I 'm actually working at night"
75142,sw3155,sd,"Well , I 'm glad to know that there 's somebody else out there that does n't get to go to the movie theater ."

145530,sw3699,sd,"and , so it , it fits well , in the neighborhood ."

155922,sw3447,sd,but that 's for my husband 's job and not mine .
4902,sw2711,sd,I 've heard to go to Austin too .
206978,sw3201,sd,I do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not .

4600,sw2168,sd,I know it .
127782,sw4927,sd,"And I also thought that , uh , that would interfere with , with college work ."
198151,sw3083,sd,"The biggest problem , well , like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools --"
168978,sw2650,sd,"I , it 's real contagious"

151170,sw3062,sd,"and it 's been great ,"

57532,sw3694,sd,"Really , it 's , it 's fairly clean , um ,"
193920,sw4038,sd,and we had to acquit him in both cases .

36740,sw3061,sd,"Um ,"
210555,sw3138,sd,"And , uh , --"
64326,sw3525,sd,so I get a pretty good little drive --

85120,sw3069,sd,"I 'm just going to have to put it ,"
126035,sw4917,sd,"it , it 's just so smooth"

77408,sw3074,sd,My kids get the biggest kick out of that .
148778,sw3338,sd,"See , I 've only been to Texas once ."
27407,sw2723,sd,but that 's kind of like an insurance thing .
144230,sw2249,sd,"and the thing is , I hardly have room now for all the things that we 're saving it to recycle ,"
40759,sw3455,sd,"Oh , it was excellent ."
50946,sw3014,sd,"Uh , you know , I mean it was ready for the graveyard ."
103255,sw2197,sd,"but the service academies have all , all the faculty , uh , for the most part is , is military with a few exchange ,"

78711,sw2053,sd,"my , uh , grandmother , um , made us a couple of quilts for the baby ,"

29915,sw2524,sd,"And a lot of my sewing I kind of do out of necessity , you know ,"
158734,sw3517,sd,I 'm just north of Addison Airport --
76510,sw2365,sd,"I need to , uh , either paper back over it or do something ."

91532,sw2285,sd,and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane .
210122,sw2370,sd,"but I was bored part of the time , too ."
129005,sw3429,sd,"I think , I think the social changes in them , I think I see it more with that generation --"

12704,sw3815,sd,"I , actually , I like the anti-lock brakes ."
82759,sw2503,sd,and she even told me that .
207692,sw3146,sd,"-- but , I 've never been there for dinner ."
49061,sw2446,sd,"and ,"
196636,sw3133,sd,so I know there is the possibility that --
23601,sw3567,sd,"and he 's , he 's working to pay those off ."
181667,sw2896,sd,and my job was mostly the woodwork .
154539,sw2603,sd,So I get all the same treatment again .
58174,sw2340,sd,"Oh , you got MUMBLEx more experience than I do then on it ."
111073,sw3453,sd,"You know , straight across ."

110936,sw3805,sd,"They expect , opening it for one hour ,"
63466,sw3051,sd,"well but , still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine , which is nowhere near what we paid for it ."
27989,sw2557,sd,and that will make another hazardous dump --
86818,sw2302,sd,I was just being curious .
143421,sw3239,sd,"and that was something we were looking for , um ,"
6760,sw3253,sd,"I do n't think of , um , trailers and campers and all this stuff ."
30551,sw2982,sd,And so one thing that I 'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits

118382,sw4829,sd,"We do n't , we do n't do enough ."

18659,sw4703,sd,Like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested .

209652,sw2305,sd,"I , I , I 'm really , I 'm really concerned about , you know ,"
98276,sw2008,sd,"Um , we moved from Colorado where ,"
58185,sw2340,sd,And that really made a bad impression on me .
61206,sw2124,sd,"I like to cook , um , heavy sauces , and , um ,"

106897,sw3072,sd,"I worked up there last summer ,"

112819,sw2883,sd,"it took me quite a while to pay them off ,"
82016,sw2441,sd,"But , you know , when it gets right down to it ,"
38658,sw3496,sd,"-- my husband works in Salt Lake ,"
43730,sw3952,sd,"And , um , we go on a , like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday ."

61459,sw2279,sd,and she could go to sleep at two in the morning --
120984,sw2187,sd,"some people like swiss , um ,"
96005,sw4876,sd,Well I am a working mother .
211526,sw3252,sd,and I saw these little Springer Spaniels --
119638,sw2283,sd,"They have a huge yard and a huge house ,"
108305,sw3225,sd,"and it 's , uh , especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave"
174904,sw3320,sd,"We 've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it , uh , as anyone , you know ."
206538,sw3682,sd,"and we had , we did lasagna and garlic bread and , uh , yummy ."
188015,sw4611,sd,this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic .
37248,sw2562,sd,"and then they have like , you know , the real velvety looking stuff inside --"
94096,sw2877,sd,and I think it 's been probably about five and a half minutes or something .
6779,sw3253,sd,"and so , I , I camped a lot in , um , the Middle East --"
80406,sw2461,sd,"We 're going to be teaching him what we can at home , of course ,"
98662,sw2275,sd,-- and the other one is NIGHT COURT .

52094,sw3709,sd,but that does n't mean it gets done .
50696,sw4681,sd,"I mean , I think I paid just as much as when --"
195892,sw3144,sd,"-- and to try and , uh , try and find time it 's hard , uh , with Jim 's schedule , too , just to get a time that we can both go ."
3159,sw2125,sd,last year it was the end of July
124771,sw2793,sd,I really had no idea .

196766,sw4688,sd,That 's about as far as we go .

164403,sw3173,sd,"It would n't be a used , used car ,"
124511,sw3029,sd,"I mean I can just get so ,"
28337,sw2101,sd,"And you could say , oh , that 's a good program for them because it 's educational"
83050,sw2703,sd,"I mean , I have , you know , I have everything he 's ever well , almost everything he 's ever done ."
174456,sw2910,sd,"And , I 'm , I , I 'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out ."
74439,sw2800,sd,"maybe not , maybe they 're not really concerned about getting paid"
205657,sw4908,sd,"Uh , uh , they 've , uh , looked at , uh , plutonium and uranium and , uh , some other similar things to --"
175256,sw2970,sd,"I mean , I have been to New York ."

74174,sw2719,sd,"Uh , I do n't really want to ,"
138190,sw2248,sd,"I do n't ,"
185262,sw4628,sd,"That way that , you know , one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time ."
87536,sw2020,sd,"Um , actually I listen to ,"
12751,sw3815,sd,I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift .
25905,sw2898,sd,"and both of them were on playoff teams , uh ,"
169640,sw3256,sd,"and I did n't , could n't realize if it was the husband or the father or what ,"
166587,sw2860,sd,"but we did that for e- , from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until , uh , our older son went away to college ."
74237,sw2719,sd,"but it 's , it 's over on the other end ."
54719,sw2175,sd,I 'll be twenty-two next month .
202650,sw3219,sd,"so he has to dress ,"
140243,sw2570,sd,Well that 's about it really .
31523,sw3527,sd,"our yard does n't have a sprinkler system , but the island does"
188199,sw2184,sd,"And it 's , it 's a factory environment ."
23828,sw3769,sd,it 's pressed .
160144,sw2427,sd,"If I have a problem discipline , you know , I think ,"
68772,sw2645,sd,"Actually , December was my first month away from them ."
94734,sw2485,sd,"But , I did n't think that was as good . Because ,"
120221,sw3090,sd,"Well , if I had your address , I would send you ,"
101379,sw2710,sd,"It 's , it 's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap ."
62862,sw2499,sd,"You know , amateurs but really quite good ."
112636,sw2380,sd,"but I did n't get elected on the panel ,"
138824,sw2086,sd,Red meat and a potato .
137455,sw2585,sd,"Because I , in general , like a smaller rather than a larger population ,"
24873,sw2623,sd,"It , uh , it was , uh , it was a , a smart move to make ."
20260,sw2478,sd,"I know a few people ,"
51700,sw3025,sd,"and then we had , uh , German Shepherds at the time ,"
39572,sw2935,sd,"But , um , you know , I just keep looking at ,"
128755,sw4759,sd,"MUMBLEx it , uh , it would be nice if we did n't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings"
108889,sw3194,sd,and it 'll start stacking up .
125114,sw2019,sd,"But , uh , next morning , she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom ."
3977,sw2506,sd,"And I went down there a couple , maybe three weeks ago for a trial ,"
113341,sw2969,sd,I do not have a real big front yard .
76489,sw2365,sd,And then the spackling had to dry a day
164899,sw3727,sd,but maybe that riding place that is North of town that she goes to .
184747,sw3830,sd,"but , uh , on the other hand , I , I , uh , I enjoy having the , the time --"
187850,sw4353,sd,"I am kind of , uh , uh , I 'm pretty bad about procrastinating --"
175413,sw2331,sd,"and , uh , we 'll get out of the driving range and , and get some interest built up"
204600,sw3174,sd,"-- he took one for , for , uh , Wal-Mart --"
154461,sw2603,sd,"Because no matter what I did or how I did it , I invariably got myself wet ."
122767,sw3659,sd,And the library will take glass .
101912,sw3245,sd,"so we 're going to talk about , uh , what kind of clothes we wear while we work ."
213807,sw3134,sd,"But , you know , part of my feeling is that if you solve , help them to work through their problems while they 're littler , then they wo n't have as many problems up there ."
171927,sw3325,sd,"the , the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it ."
212794,sw2018,sd,"it is ,"

167236,sw2469,sd,"I do a little bit of woodworking ,"
177854,sw4608,sd,and he took the guy to court and won a settlement .
77188,sw2734,sd,And none of them even smoke .
49835,sw3167,sd,"Oh , I love to eat it ,"
149419,sw3343,sd,"it , it really is , uh ,"
64854,sw2782,sd,"and we were just , you know , dirt poor ."
60171,sw2773,sd,he was for sanctions .
205661,sw4908,sd,Actually --
33187,sw3057,sd,"the children thoroughly enjoy ,"
153946,sw2154,sd,"and then I supplement that with , uh , radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week ,"
212999,sw2772,sd,"and we got quite a bit of rain ,"
27344,sw3271,sd,"He was just , you know , he was getting so old and had a , other problems too ."
208847,sw3801,sd,There are marvelous B M W -s and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns .
23599,sw3567,sd,"He had to , you know ,"
126769,sw3736,sd,"They have made so much money from that , that they built , they bought a brand new fire engine ,"
177884,sw2658,sd,"I , for years I did all that shopping and whatnot ,"
102514,sw3232,sd,"Well , I , I felt a little cheated at Tech , also ."
146060,sw2253,sd,"And I , I 'm trying to think of , oh , Isaac Asimov , ROBOT series ."
9419,sw2871,sd,and everyone else watched it .
136773,sw3050,sd,"uh , I , uh , when I was younger , I played a little bit"
93243,sw2828,sd,they 've always been involved .
140805,sw2178,sd,"But the drugs did n't work for long ,"
15759,sw2953,sd,I thought about that .
2609,sw2289,sd,and I 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin .
187845,sw4353,sd,She also works --
202996,sw2429,sd,and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time
102275,sw2549,sd,"and the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan , I got fired can you believe that ."
10650,sw3754,sd,"And , uh , that , that I would like to go ,"
121095,sw2187,sd,I 've never heard of that .
84071,sw2465,sd,"but , you know , he , his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing , you know ,"
83577,sw2672,sd,That was a shocker to me .
90988,sw2818,sd,"Uh , at one point in time we 've had au pairs ,"
107695,sw2992,sd,A cat has nine lives --
2997,sw3034,sd,So that was interesting .
27987,sw2557,sd,"And now they want to put it in ,"
142012,sw3002,sd,"I , I used to think that I was probably the only one that just , I do n't know , was running around so much ."
125856,sw3791,sd,Real good .
103793,sw3408,sd,"and , even in high school you could say high to your teachers , unless you 're in that biology class ,"
79047,sw2835,sd,"Thirty years ago I guess there were color T V -s ,"
43355,sw2767,sd,"Because her statement was , I told him let 's face it"
213055,sw2772,sd,it 's nothing like Houston .
25061,sw2889,sd,And then I have a five year old daughter
213311,sw3142,sd,"M- , m- , m- , my sister , who also lives here in Dallas , uh , tends to , uh , chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner , which drives me absolutely batty ."

91040,sw2818,sd,"It 's not always ,"
22321,sw2960,sd,And I thought that was real neat .
209621,sw2305,sd,"and you know , talking about fields , people going into different fields , I made an off , off the cuff remark about lawyers ,"
127274,sw2726,sd,"But it , it , you know , we looked at a lot of houses that were , had more square footage ,"
68950,sw3187,sd,"And that , the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days , and would have to be hospitalized a day or two ,"
60394,sw3260,sd,"My son ,"
110444,sw2849,sd,and now it 's called Roberto Clemente .

140616,sw2690,sd,"Well , my husband smokes ."

64248,sw3525,sd,"and did , and I really did n't find much improvement ."
52386,sw2803,sd,"It 's , uh , it 's , it 's not like it used to be even in , in the years of my growing up ."
31844,sw2205,sd,"I have several chores and things to do ,"
54347,sw2780,sd,so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then .
88737,sw2336,sd,"I mean , they were ,"
195860,sw3144,sd,"And so I went to my doctors last Thursday ,"
20363,sw2812,sd,that 's not a broad enough topic .
112395,sw3011,sd,"and , uh , it was practically new when I moved in here"
143318,sw3491,sd,"It was like , uh , want an autograph , want to stand in line for about four hours ."
52986,sw2934,sd,"The last two years before , they 've had record rainfall ."
133643,sw2235,sd,I went shopping .
191207,sw3075,sd,"and , but this year we 're not going to be taking one for several reasons ."
163932,sw2691,sd,"So it 's different than the , than the long Texas ramblers ."
38422,sw2692,sd,and just normal driving did n't do it .
54863,sw2175,sd,I mean --
48319,sw3735,sd,"oh , I would love one of these ."
169908,sw2868,sd,"and then when we- , eventually , when we have kids ,"
25669,sw2898,sd,"their best player this year , you know , averaged twenty points a game --"
166068,sw2231,sd,"-- and they just get away with it ,"
44590,sw2950,sd,And I try to cover up when I do the lawn .
125360,sw2631,sd,"so by that time she was so well established , you know ,"
78776,sw4633,sd,I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more .
77252,sw3074,sd,"maybe you saw in the paper this morning that , um , they 've had some problems with ,"
41812,sw3181,sd,"So , my kids , luckily , are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk ."
7866,sw2232,sd,"I 've been a Christian five years ,"
86843,sw3150,sd,"Oh , I 'm pretty much for it ."
197958,sw2028,sd,but fortunately it rains
59265,sw3107,sd,"They , you know , usually let her ,"
102049,sw3245,sd,"-- I do n't know if you can ,"
10013,sw2716,sd,"I 'm extremely liberal ,"
205532,sw3595,sd,"it seems like she does n't write as often as , oh , well , like Danielle Steele and those silly things ."
133965,sw2999,sd,So now they 're hitting me up there with a finance charge .
171482,sw2439,sd,I had gone over to Texins
173189,sw3417,sd,I 've just received some .
129662,sw2926,sd,"-- as , as an athlete , I just hate that ."
203861,sw2604,sd,I do n't remember for sure now .
45133,sw2578,sd,"And I thought just purely for entertainment , I might enjoy that ."
210006,sw3251,sd,"I go there on business ,"
11604,sw3760,sd,"Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you , but is I program for fun . Uh , on the computer ."
78367,sw3551,sd,I do n't know .
27000,sw2821,sd,"and , um , I had never had saki ."
173492,sw3275,sd,so . And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities .
138065,sw2248,sd,"I do n't , I do n't think I 'm a real true , trooper , you know , when it comes ,"
55936,sw2983,sd,"but I 'm open to try anything ,"
91012,sw2818,sd,I think it 's just a matter of priorities .
157733,sw2442,sd,"and I enjoy that because I like the group association , you know , like exercising with other people ."
168700,sw2650,sd,"and ,"
17988,sw2303,sd,"So for instance , in , um , the last presidential election , I 'm sure a lot of people thought , Oh , Bush is going to win either way ,"
171517,sw2439,sd,"-- and , uh , that they required you to do ."
45923,sw2662,sd,"and you have a , they have an attorney for , you know , attorney for you and attorney ,"
11508,sw3760,sd,"But it is a hobby too , that I enjoy --"
193300,sw4127,sd,but I doubt I do it more than three times a year .
13782,sw2368,sd,we do n't .
131729,sw3535,sd,"But I think there was something like , you know , thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail ."
101294,sw2073,sd,"Uh , Washington , D C ,"
124911,sw2996,sd,"and it really raised a lot of money for the , for the state ."
27058,sw2821,sd,and she 's six months
178977,sw3382,sd,"And I , I 'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like , you know ,"
213898,sw3134,sd,It 's scary to me .
209236,sw2548,sd,"supposedly , the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever"
2608,sw2289,sd,"But we have , we have a very aggressive recycling at work ,"
115731,sw3030,sd,"I mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff ,"
199468,sw2628,sd,"They get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that ,"
27678,sw2723,sd,"uh , retirement ."
172122,sw2330,sd,"It 's been a , a fun break ,"
119869,sw2283,sd,but I do n't remember what they look like .
119823,sw2283,sd,"Well , I 'm not really worried about it ,"
111124,sw3453,sd,"and my Allante has , uh --"
70808,sw4114,sd,"They 're all , you know , going ,"
180306,sw2627,sd,I tried it like once or twice
158595,sw2608,sd,"So we cook a lot of pasta , and , uh , gravies , and pizzas , and , you know , roasts , and that kind of thing ."
197315,sw3467,sd,my kids are older --
137891,sw3681,sd,"It 's just me in the house ,"
19628,sw2355,sd,"And so I feel really enriched in that a lot of people do n't get to see ,"
188768,sw4171,sd,and I wish they did .
182479,sw4682,sd,"And they 've , most of them have been pretty good ,"
74842,sw2160,sd,I 'm from North Carolina .
84794,sw2527,sd,"I do n't know if the camping that I 've done is really roughing it without a , a whole lot of stuff ."
18055,sw2303,sd,"Just go in and say , Oh , I want to be a juror ,"
131682,sw3535,sd,"Oh , well , I 've got one in college ."
90680,sw4548,sd,"On the one hand I , I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I could n't --"
1812,sw4802,sd,"Uh , I re , received , uh , uh , several books for Christmas"
123604,sw3092,sd,and she is now into consulting
75660,sw3574,sd,"Wisconsin has a , a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag --"
151991,sw2012,sd,and things are quite different there in terms of that .
173022,sw2525,sd,They 're just very tough on criminals .
197479,sw3467,sd,"But , they said she held up so well yesterday ."
204030,sw3495,sd,"But we have , uh ,"
32058,sw2432,sd,and we recycle paper .
85500,sw2472,sd,We do n't eat desserts much any more .
192823,sw2109,sd,"but , uh , he , he said he enjoyed it"
173131,sw3417,sd,"As far as other countries , I 'm not , um , I do n't keep up on it too much as to far as what , you know , as what they 're do ."
125213,sw2019,sd,"I had , uh , a similar , uh , experience ."
14888,sw2709,sd,"And , and they are wonderful people"
182833,sw2761,sd,"it 's a little north of Indianapolis , about an hour ."
20970,sw3102,sd,"And I , I ended up graduating with like a three point six ."
89261,sw4728,sd,And so they just fit in there .
172081,sw3325,sd,I think --
188844,sw4171,sd,"Uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used to be much more stable ."
117258,sw2642,sd,and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit .
41469,sw3204,sd,but my dad 's the type he would n't want to spend the money on anything .
36551,sw2457,sd,we never used to have to water our lawns --
12966,sw2776,sd,"But , I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine , I 'm not , cholesterol , I 'm not worried about it ."
129700,sw2736,sd,"I 've got , uh , a couple older cars ,"
4355,sw3433,sd,"You know , the fir- , the whole first nine weeks of school is , is used as a review"
88120,sw3115,sd,"they put one on the parents , or the teachers and say they have to , the men have to wear ties"
2785,sw2038,sd,"but what we would ,"
131065,sw3018,sd,"we usually watch L A LAW ,"
79022,sw2835,sd,"So I would say that 's one of the largest changes in , at least in my life ."
197337,sw3467,sd,"I think it 's , when it 's good , it 's just a scream ."
58050,sw3414,sd,"and phone numbers , and , and that kind of stuff ."
116324,sw2287,sd,"and say , huh , you know , why should we vote ,"
207100,sw3349,sd,"basically it , it was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE"
85920,sw2421,sd,Most of these are young people .
183899,sw4334,sd,so I do n't know how --
139442,sw3087,sd,"so I thought that I would put that ,"
200744,sw3306,sd,"Uh , there are supposed to be , uh , some people f- , moving down here from Colorado Springs for T I ."
110604,sw2849,sd,I just thought I 'd ask that because I wondered what you thought they might think .
36453,sw2457,sd,I know it just --
196072,sw2775,sd,"This entire neighborhood , everybody keeps the places up real nice ."
104555,sw3373,sd,"that kind , that 's the kind I like really more than ,"
89892,sw2756,sd,so I 've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends --
166262,sw2784,sd,and they dumped it all on the local school districts .
100815,sw2832,sd,and the wind came in from the north
164098,sw2436,sd,"We just , my wife and I just recently moved into our house ."
52024,sw3709,sd,"It is really the , uh , aerobic work out part ."
213883,sw3134,sd,"and one of the Plano school district 's , you know , goals is that they will graduate every child that , uh , that is here in the ninth grade ,"
62226,sw3317,sd,my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while .
123731,sw3092,sd,"So , that 's it"
82381,sw2131,sd,"and , and , uh , so , I , I , I appreciate his too ,"
165055,sw3720,sd,We do n't have H B O .
131861,sw2984,sd,"And so what I did , I switched to liquid ,"
786,sw3426,sd,"and lot of times we do n't answer the phone , probably when I get mine --"
117216,sw2642,sd,And we only have one .
94409,sw2876,sd,"uh , now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they ca n't use ,"
44295,sw3703,sd,it 's Cajun type stuff .
124555,sw2963,sd,It was every summer we got together .
203320,sw4101,sd,"but , uh , instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about , uh , I am starting to split stu- , split stuff up ."
35366,sw3257,sd,but we did n't get to watch it tonight .
102704,sw2102,sd,and one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids .
155225,sw3362,sd,"Gardening in Texas is really interesting , though ."
185664,sw4151,sd,"and he , he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when , uh , people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion --"
172304,sw2139,sd,and there 's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine
135783,sw2586,sd,Kathy and Kevin Guy .
207751,sw3146,sd,"-- and , and they keep saying , you know , oh , it 's wonderful , it 's wonderful ."
17593,sw3158,sd,that 's the next project that I 'd like to learn to do .
81886,sw2441,sd,You sit there
205906,sw3108,sd,"That was next on our list ,"
200280,sw4019,sd,"I live alone in an apartment , and , uh , --"
64282,sw3525,sd,"so it , that makes a lot of difference to me ."
211493,sw3252,sd,"they were used to be used on ships and in , for , for mousers --"
196947,sw3389,sd,"so I kind of grabbed on to that team ,"
115010,sw2887,sd,"T I is at least ,"
57039,sw2237,sd,"We do n't , we do n't usually cover ours ."
32309,sw2432,sd,"Well I 've never ,"
96690,sw2299,sd,"Sometimes it just sits around for a while ,"
154349,sw2603,sd,"But two years ago , I joined , well , it 's not quite two years , it 's almost two years , I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano ."
93662,sw3195,sd,"and I said , you know how when you have a bad one , you say , never again --"
182766,sw2761,sd,"So , um , we usually meet like at my uncle 's cottage in the , um , at the lake and , uh , make a couple days of it ."
1091,sw2040,sd,"So , if they 've just taken such action , it would seem to indicate to me either they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state , or maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish , or Hispanic heritage ."
182170,sw2554,sd,"I , I was stationed in , in Turkey for , for a year and a half ."
161588,sw3004,sd,"but I know that at day care they have more of a , a routine like at- , maybe in , uh ,"
203622,sw2837,sd,"well the thing that 's funny is they 've done , uh , they 've done things like that , you know ,"
38366,sw2692,sd,"And i- , it 's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff ,"
172097,sw3325,sd,"Anyway that 's what we have ,"
45594,sw3770,sd,"But , uh , in this case , uh , spouse and I , uh , are , uh , we 're , are , are , uh , united in this area because ,"
95104,sw2435,sd,and then all of a sudden I 'm saying I wish I 'd bought these things .
75238,sw3425,sd,"and then he ru , he 's a runner , too ."
71460,sw2220,sd,"There , there 's a guy ,"
93138,sw2598,sd,"it 's , it 's one of the reasons why , you know THE GODFATHER 's been on our minds lately ."
85840,sw2421,sd,I mean I have n't had one yet .
158210,sw2022,sd,"we 've taken that this year ,"
165090,sw3720,sd,"Maybe Brian will still be up , and spend some time with him ."
151501,sw3047,sd,"but , uh , it seemed like there were quite a few --"
197244,sw4877,sd,"I mean her , all her kids were sick"
164394,sw3173,sd,"and that was kind of iffy ,"
90538,sw2366,sd,"and then inevitably I am swept away by the , the pressure of other types of things ,"
210851,sw4099,sd,and that 's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me --
86398,sw2479,sd,"all the teachers , like about half the teachers are degreed teachers ."
75793,sw2072,sd,"And we like movies ,"
58629,sw2467,sd,"FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it . Uh ,"
59157,sw3489,sd,"Whatever he makes , it 's all out of the same thing ."
98967,sw2137,sd,"if there was , if there was mandatory , you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary ,"
200645,sw3306,sd,I 've sailed some .
16518,sw3136,sd,So like I wanted to go out and kill them too .
189473,sw2395,sd,Well --
200065,sw2729,sd,"and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him , uh , I or , I gue , Humane Society and got , uh , got another one , a stray ."
3048,sw2125,sd,"the majority of my camping experience is , uh , a tent by the lake type situation or , uh , maybe a canoe trip or something like that ."
152768,sw3393,sd,"and there are trees that , that still have their leaves on ,"
99789,sw2226,sd,"I love old , good old ,"
177312,sw3168,sd,it 's increasing .
147750,sw4785,sd,"Boy , we really got to know the kids well ."
205188,sw2708,sd,"it was like only , it was either sixty percent or forty percent , go to college ."
40435,sw2954,sd,"They propagate pretty well , those little fish ."
151923,sw2012,sd,"Um , the , the other side of that might be if , if someone found out something or surmised something that were n't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense ."
83822,sw4376,sd,"But , but I feel like if I did , I probably would feel that way ."
100686,sw2832,sd,the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
166906,sw2866,sd,"but she had , she had le , called and left a message on our recorder"
212526,sw4868,sd,"Budgeting activity in our household I , has is , uh , uh , kind of an informal kind of situation ."
154684,sw3345,sd,"I do n't just read everything about it ,"
58485,sw2467,sd,But it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist .
88972,sw2565,sd,"I mean , the guy 's twenty , twenty-five home rums , maybe thirty , eighty some R B I-s ."
138032,sw2248,sd,but now we 're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports .
128501,sw3911,sd,and we will be working together .
195644,sw4320,sd,"uh , I think they call it car jacking around here ."
156181,sw4013,sd,"and our next door neighbor was there ,"
146100,sw2253,sd,And they had a centennial here awhile back .
211786,sw3113,sd,and --
207306,sw3796,sd,"Uh , you know , it 's kind of , I guess it 's kind of like , uh , there in the Bay area , you know , you do n't find a whole lot of , uh , of Sacramento fans ."
88956,sw2565,sd,I think that 's right .
125359,sw2631,sd,"and , and he got himself pretty far along , I guess they did n't have kids until he was about , twenty sev- , twenty-six"
120581,sw4675,sd,I usually try to guesstimate
22215,sw2960,sd,Language too .
69620,sw3111,sd,"Uh , I live on the outskirts of Baltimore"
97134,sw3697,sd,I took it to an independent --
92956,sw2598,sd,I think he 's very interesting
188012,sw4611,sd,"Uh , uh I , I should say something ."
167256,sw2469,sd,"I 've , I 've , uh , made some small things , cross stitch things ."
115796,sw3030,sd,"I , I really do ."
34098,sw2190,sd,"but , uh , I- , I 'll do that in a minute ."
97878,sw2648,sd,"but , uh , I think the only , the main thing is just keep on the , legis- , your legislator 's back , you know , as far as ,"
127599,sw2180,sd,Here we go .
183060,sw4358,sd,"Uh , and , and matter of fact , I think it took like three tries t- , for it to go through ."
109227,sw2893,sd,"But in the rain , oh , I love to run in the rain ,"
848,sw3426,sd,"They wanted to watch PRETTY WOMAN , which I have --"
61891,sw3746,sd,"So , if you start putting them , you know , you can put them out in the spring too ,"
13867,sw2368,sd,"you know , I had a ,"
204833,sw3171,sd,-- and it will be at this time of the year
166872,sw2866,sd,they both moved way out .
161983,sw3533,sd,"and so they ,"
200327,sw4019,sd,He wo n't even let my son shower .
184483,sw4028,sd,"and , my husband and I have just elected that if that happens , I will go and just pay ."
140441,sw2690,sd,"Uh , people recognized Dallas , Texas , by the , the Texas , uh , the , the cowboys --"
145136,sw2641,sd,"I may still be ,"
174245,sw2304,sd,"And , then we also put sausages on a bun ,"
70763,sw2460,sd,"There are so many games in , in a year that they 've got to have repeat customers ."
117009,sw2105,sd,"when he was in high school , he enjoyed going to baseball games ."
102585,sw3279,sd,"it really does bother me when I think about , you know , leaving our children with , with this sort of , uh , a national problem that we ca n't seem to find an , an answer to it , uh ,"
103498,sw3666,sd,"well , I call my lawn man , Eric , whatever his name is , I ca n't remember ."
166665,sw2866,sd,"We usually watch the local news and the , the , uh , national news both ."
138677,sw4940,sd,"they went , I do n't know , how many miles an hour ."
52764,sw2339,sd,but --
202487,sw4150,sd,"And the time that my , we spent with our Dad was , he owned his own business"
180093,sw4792,sd,"But , uh , that friend of mine 's telling me that I might have to go in for , uh , as a witness ."
74575,sw2445,sd,"we did go camping in Arkans- , not Arkansas , Oklahoma ."
211054,sw3169,sd,but it bit enough to where I let go .
109598,sw2313,sd,"technically it 's two days ,"
97080,sw3697,sd,"I change oil ,"
32152,sw2432,sd,Um . I never heard of that .
148693,sw3236,sd,"and ,"
34970,sw2373,sd,"So we 're expecting our local economy to ,"
210668,sw3138,sd,because --

40676,sw3847,sd,-- I 'm thinking White Narcissus or something --
75170,sw3155,sd,"I , I know we get discount tickets --"
58095,sw2340,sd,She 's not in a nursing home . Uh .
105937,sw2616,sd,"and they 're selling , you know , you know ,"
62572,sw2499,sd,"And there 's rats in the attic , you know ."
213691,sw3186,sd,"So that 's , that 's a very good place to eat , The Blue Mesa Grill ."
24785,sw2623,sd,"So , I did n't have much of a role model to go by ."
206290,sw3152,sd,"and he introduced my brother and I both , to a lot of it ."
62258,sw3317,sd,"Well , I just watch them ."
192957,sw3435,sd,"when teeing off i- , I 'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground"
136654,sw3431,sd,"and there , there were crayon marks on there"
60777,sw2433,sd,"I 've been there like , maybe a dozen times ."
137204,sw2006,sd,"Um , I 've enjoyed speaking with you ,"
4465,sw2168,sd,you 're right .
171097,sw2790,sd,"it 's like something around sixty , sixty-five percent or so now ."
84314,sw2382,sd,but people are more sympathetic to it .
182368,sw2554,sd,And that 's all I plan to do .
119837,sw2283,sd,this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch
87016,sw3150,sd,"So , she tried to enter her number"
182034,sw3284,sd,"and , uh , and I , I , I do n't know what , what has , what has set it off or what"
188797,sw4171,sd,"Otherwise you can , uh , guess you can put , also put money , hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed or can just have that money , you know , put in your paycheck ."
104176,sw3049,sd,"I , I never did care for him as , in the James Bond movies ."
188101,sw4611,sd,"and when I arrived at her house , she was engrossed in that ."
111029,sw3453,sd,they really do .
81505,sw2434,sd,"And like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , uh , about three years old ."
560,sw2278,sd,"we , we 've just got a freeway ."
11527,sw3760,sd,I guess the car too .
146109,sw2253,sd,"See , I had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago ."
38802,sw2968,sd,but a lot of silly little questions .
130057,sw2110,sd,"That proposed it ,"
31536,sw3527,sd,I just hope it does n't go up any more
44035,sw2955,sd,It --
127695,sw2180,sd,"And , uh , you know , some of it just seemed rather extreme ."
6609,sw3189,sd,"and my cousins , they just go stay with their mom and dad , you know --"
2523,sw2289,sd,and our city will pick up our recyclables .
19840,sw3001,sd,And at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas .
104464,sw4723,sd,it 's almost three years actually .
43389,sw2767,sd,I did n't .
126529,sw3464,sd,"Oh , this is the ,"
71666,sw2220,sd,"This guy had supposedly , uh , strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose ."
162184,sw2897,sd,"But other than that I do n't have much feeling for , for the benefits ,"
10812,sw2090,sd,I 've just been singing every chance I get .
15675,sw2953,sd,Woodstock .
206612,sw3682,sd,and it just .

152468,sw2171,sd,"I do have one plant here ,"
66606,sw2521,sd,"I , I 'd have to confess I do n't really scope out the New Orleans games , per se ."
9538,sw3597,sd,That 's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly .
118039,sw2575,sd,"I , uh , thought I was smart , ran away and got married ,"
205191,sw2708,sd,"So , I thought that was interesting ."
202519,sw4150,sd,"My husband is a physician ,"
10671,sw2090,sd,so I remembered something I learned I think when I was five years old
23823,sw3214,sd,-- it 's got to have everything .
116341,sw2287,sd,"he 's so off the wall that , uh , he 's gone in and tried to get into city elections"
210999,sw4099,sd,and still I was so sore
75980,sw2334,sd,you know when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those --
85557,sw2472,sd,it 's real quick .
208333,sw2290,sd,"I do n't , I do n't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching ."
107118,sw3386,sd,"Uh , it 's a pretty big expense nowadays ."
143875,sw2157,sd,"I did n't , I did n't really think about that ."
182202,sw2554,sd,"that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country , too ."
52813,sw2339,sd,But we 're set now .
61868,sw3746,sd,"I like to have ,"
60154,sw2418,sd,"And her , her mother went over there just for that ..."
195772,sw3144,sd,"So we went to see SOAPDISH ,"
66130,sw2913,sd,"Oh , it 's sweet ,"
98249,sw2008,sd,"Um , where I work is predominantly male ."
88267,sw4859,sd,"But here I am , you know , cheek by jowl with our nation 's capital"
88891,sw3159,sd,"Now see your computer ones ,"
159942,sw2504,sd,"and she said well , uh , why , you know ."
76499,sw2365,sd,"so , I just used a , like a semigloss ."
119292,sw3845,sd,"see , well that 's , uh , the , there was another call on Saturday , Saturday that was also from , uh , that was the one from California ."
152175,sw3993,sd,"-- and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment , kept up with that ."
104523,sw3373,sd,"and we took that ,"
62526,sw2499,sd,"Uh , I 'm , I 'm afraid to go see that one ."
197541,sw3038,sd,"Being a child , you know ."
191247,sw3075,sd,"We , we 've gone with friends each time ."
38395,sw2692,sd,so I 'm always very careful when I change hoses on it .
126024,sw4917,sd,"Uh , you know , about a minute or so ."
84127,sw2465,sd,"They only come out four times a year ,"
56269,sw3185,sd,"I do not like the humid- , ."
163606,sw2909,sd,It 's like any other symphony .
125571,sw2631,sd,"This is Baltimore , Maryland ."
28110,sw3665,sd,I do n't know why .
206347,sw3152,sd,"I ca n't ,"
109006,sw2893,sd,"and ,"
27628,sw2723,sd,"It 's through Baxter Labs . Uh ,"
32881,sw3057,sd,she did .
179232,sw2568,sd,"I , I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most , uh , that I was really the most in shock with was probably , uh , STAR WARS ."
8025,sw2770,sd,and he was out of town last weekend
194600,sw4619,sd,and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation .
135114,sw3105,sd,The thing that even though juries sometimes make the decision
29677,sw2854,sd,"I mean , you 're far enough away now I can tell you since this is locally , I make sure , we 're going to Romania in a few weeks ."
63584,sw3051,sd,"they , they show very well un- , they show very well unless you have , you know , lived in a lot of houses around the area ,"
165755,sw2634,sd,as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we 're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade .
51000,sw3014,sd,Nissan is Japanese .
53021,sw2934,sd,"and mixes it with the , with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean ."
16841,sw3738,sd,"you had the , the Russians against the Americans , the Communists against the Free World ,"
1431,sw2325,sd,"Uh , I work part-time"
83885,sw2465,sd,"the company I work for furnishes ,"
214488,sw2611,sd,"so it 's full of smoke when , when you go in there ."
187119,sw3876,sd,"Every time you buy a container , no matter what it is , whether it is glass , whether it 's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever , you pay ten cents for it --"
183940,sw4334,sd,you go into the coffee house
108874,sw3194,sd,"and it just goes out with our trash ,"
211132,sw3821,sd,and I do n't have to to be writing checks
77981,sw3988,sd,"Um , I have some Spiro Gyro tapes ."
12155,sw2827,sd,We put them out for people
142203,sw3020,sd,"Um , August , eighty-eight ."
198018,sw2028,sd,"But , I did n't . Uh ."
79459,sw3638,sd,"and , you know --"
37544,sw3352,sd,"-- and we have a lot of , uh , beautiful fresh water streams that come through thi- , this area ."
206595,sw3682,sd,"Oh , I love it ."
174490,sw2910,sd,I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT .
141599,sw2448,sd,"now here in , in Texas , uh , all you need is a driver 's license ."
9337,sw2871,sd,"It was pretty scary because I was visiting a V A Hospital , uh , near to where I live"
137521,sw2585,sd,"And there 's a lot of graft , like people trying to tell them , oh , giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it ."
8965,sw2354,sd,"anyway , uh , I had a friend that read a book on that"
167549,sw2615,sd,"And basically it , it was a motor"
75975,sw2334,sd,"I was n't buying , you know , just to hold onto it ."
78088,sw2609,sd,"Anyone who does n't vote , it 's fine with me as long as I can have their vote ."
170545,sw2559,sd,"And I would n't be for total banning of , uh , all information"
8333,sw2534,sd,"And I did n't , I do n't like Devon Rexes at first ."
62488,sw2051,sd,"But , you know , her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is ..."
174510,sw2910,sd,"I 'm from , uh ,"
79140,sw2835,sd,"Well , I , I was in English as a matter of fact , and --"
203907,sw2604,sd,"and , and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth ."
49865,sw3167,sd,I do n't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something .
120976,sw2187,sd,"and I was going to try something weird which , you know ,"
62751,sw2499,sd,I ca n't either .
30062,sw3290,sd,-- and I work with him a couple days a week --
27277,sw3271,sd,"and , and when my mother lived with us , uh , the cat was really hers"
132075,sw2185,sd,it was kind of an orangish brown .
122770,sw3659,sd,"and ,"
155032,sw2584,sd,"I 'm , um , I 'm a struggling single mom ."
36327,sw2389,sd,"And I notice today kids , you know ,"
112977,sw2579,sd,"So , uh , I felt a little more secure that I was at home rather than having to be out driving in it ."
193354,sw4127,sd,and I do n't have to worry about keeping records of anything else --
194165,sw4379,sd,this is the first year we 've done it this way .
55923,sw2983,sd,But I am not an athlete at all .
37836,sw3184,sd,"Uh , there 's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes"
42118,sw3716,sd,I feel so silly
130153,sw2110,sd,"Let 's see , one of my friends had a roommate that worked for T I"
34176,sw2190,sd,"I do n't know if it 's air pollution it 's , uh , it 's dust pollution whether it 's natural or not I do n't know ."
62135,sw3317,sd,"-- and then we subbed it out ,"
98785,sw2275,sd,"but I just , I like the , the cut and dry solve the mystery ,"
136142,sw3291,sd,I mean there is --
26190,sw3711,sd,I do
17086,sw3319,sd,"Or you 'll hear thirty and think , boy --"
117910,sw3353,sd,It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river --
187847,sw4353,sd,"-- and , uh , but she , she enjoys it"
98870,sw2275,sd,"it 's funny how we , uh , we , we romanticize people --"
106204,sw2806,sd,"He 'd come out to the kitchen ,"
27135,sw2821,sd,"and then , um , on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves ."
100961,sw3364,sd,"the , the new character on there did ."
201939,sw4765,sd,"so , you know , I 'm one of these , you know , ten , twelve , fifteen , twenty hour a day type people ."
138219,sw2248,sd,"and , but this was n't so fun this last time for Nathan to , to get out there"
213076,sw2772,sd,so I really like that about this area .
117127,sw2105,sd,He either hits home run or strike out .
106018,sw3557,sd,I do n't know .
187512,sw3315,sd,"So , usually I do n't get a whole lot of news watching in ."
91512,sw2285,sd,"and a lot of them go over the border , especially like Mercedes ."
17534,sw3042,sd,and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable .
178663,sw2547,sd,"by administrator I , I think I mean ,"
142479,sw3397,sd,"I have n't recently , um ."
7034,sw3019,sd,"it 's very successful for some of ,"
134937,sw2875,sd,"and , in fact , I stock the same part ,"
145780,sw4642,sd,"-- and , uh , it was , it was a real lemon ."
125618,sw3071,sd,"Um , well , I likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs ,"
51281,sw2576,sd,"or she 's just working like within the school ,"
117325,sw2642,sd,"we take the time to , you know , help my daughter ,"
69067,sw3377,sd,"or , but sometimes it all comes together ."
154341,sw2603,sd,"I wish that I did enjoy it more ,"
3134,sw2125,sd,"well I , I do have , uh , a little bit of property ,"
13442,sw2483,sd,"Uh , other than that it was a MUMBLEx at best ."
25192,sw2889,sd,"Like I said , I like doing a lot of outdoor stuff ,"
141400,sw2025,sd,"But I also , I 've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient , you know ,"
33593,sw3077,sd,"-- like you said , I 've worked in different places ,"
211911,sw2107,sd,and then we did all this for him .
103432,sw4149,sd,I do n't plan on being a starving artist .
22288,sw2960,sd,I have always liked --
78551,sw2053,sd,I 've got a new born
50605,sw3151,sd,"Well , in Saudi Arabia , you know , using , uh , alcohol and drugs and something like that , you get the death penalty ."
98308,sw2008,sd,"It 's nice to get ,"
43761,sw3952,sd,"So , I 've just been doing it , I try to do it every night --"
47531,sw2774,sd,we have brick on the outside
166620,sw2860,sd,"So , I think as they 're getting in college , I just ,"
142319,sw3020,sd,and she just gave me this woman 's name to contact
144568,sw3082,sd,and our grandchildren are going now .
54317,sw2780,sd,but
69015,sw3377,sd,I have n't gotten the chance lately though to play .
205016,sw3427,sd,"Well , uh , we always ,"
166325,sw2784,sd,"But , but , I 'm not too sure when I put my property tax in , my car tax , my income tax , and these myriad of , uh ,"
66622,sw2521,sd,"and I lived in Detroit , too ."
106301,sw2806,sd,he had a hot pad
83266,sw2703,sd,And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away .
193610,sw3798,sd,"Uh , that 's something I 've never really kept up with at all ."
97924,sw2362,sd,"But , but , anyway , at the time that 's what I taught ."
131483,sw3003,sd,"I , I understand that ."
133160,sw2301,sd,and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them .
211620,sw3925,sd,"they say you ,"
50941,sw3014,sd,"If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it , I 'd buy a Ford ."
184256,sw3073,sd,"Just some of the times they 're continued ,"
130765,sw3340,sd,"everybody died ,"
198390,sw3962,sd,"I , I play guitar and , and early years played saxophone ."
2491,sw2289,sd,We got like a penny a pound for them .
83936,sw2465,sd,"something like that ,"
177024,sw4886,sd,"-- and whatever you have to put in there to get the , s- , to take the gaps out between the sheets --"
145507,sw3699,sd,"it 's , uh , it 's only like eleven hundred square feet ."
61248,sw2124,sd,"it had all the vegetables in it ,"
75630,sw3574,sd,"-- and during , uh , certain wind directions because we get the , uh , Gary , Indiana --"
26443,sw3013,sd,"and , uh , my family and I , we 're a sit down together family ."
186442,sw4617,sd,"And , uh , there 's a big uproar going on right now . Uh --"
73701,sw2092,sd,"Um , computer communications and data transmissions ."
93427,sw3513,sd,"While we 're talking , my next car , I 'd like to be sporty and , you know --"
10435,sw2768,sd,"I 'm always afraid like , oh ,"
191461,sw3445,sd,"actually I , we saw her just the other night too ."
204657,sw2749,sd,"I never have either ,"
88991,sw2565,sd,"But that does n't mean get three other guys who hit , all they can do is hit home runs and strike out --"
91521,sw2285,sd,"and once you 've reached the , the river walk area , which is the tourist area , it 's usually pretty safe during the day , if you 're just kind of cautious and do n't go down the back streets or alleys , and , um , you know , or alone ."
13477,sw2483,sd,"My wife and I , you know , as mentioned ,"
73744,sw2092,sd,"and I , you know , I do n't wa- , I do n't like to give any at all --"
88130,sw3115,sd,"I see that the ,"
85969,sw2421,sd,"Personally , I think that 's what I was about to say --"
92978,sw2598,sd,"so , you know , after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS , you know ,"
67839,sw3628,sd,"we 've , I 've been all over the states except for pretty much east ."
166861,sw2866,sd,"She was a state auditor ,"
169819,sw2868,sd,"I know that , uh , uh , one of , one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family ."
203203,sw3120,sd,"And , uh , my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school ."
80869,sw2121,sd,"the , the twelve and fifteen year old cars , you know , contribute like ninety percent ,"
111150,sw3368,sd,but I do n't know what to do to stop it .
68298,sw2032,sd,"I , I told them I 'd be available during this time ,"
101855,sw3254,sd,-- and I 'll order steak or steak and lobster combined --
74183,sw2719,sd,"but I can really tell the difference , since I have not been able to walk ."
102595,sw3279,sd,"and I do n't mind , uh , paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to ."
206234,sw3411,sd,"You know , it 's American made too --"
203995,sw3495,sd,"she came home and everything in her house was total gone , light fixtures , everything ."
149018,sw3983,sd,"I mean , I read it ,"
183309,sw4133,sd,"it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in ,"
158773,sw3517,sd,So the whole block was all foreclosed .
70821,sw4114,sd,"I guess , from what I hear , though , uh , next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars ."
196347,sw2095,sd,"I was just talking to my son today ,"
15131,sw2707,sd,"I have the little flower boxes with , um , a v- , a lot of different flowers ,"
13184,sw4630,sd,"but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically , uh , so fast --"
171668,sw3237,sd,and our home is really too small for us right now .
3749,sw3813,sd,"So it , it 's , uh , it 's helpful ."
30599,sw2982,sd,"So I think that in general the doctor 's fees are probably lower there ,"
1495,sw2325,sd,The reputation was fantastic for this place .
57199,sw2237,sd,"You find them under bricks and all that stuff , where it 's moist ,"
53118,sw2934,sd,and it tore up the people inside the car .
52497,sw2803,sd,"I feel very safe where I am , you know ,"
113212,sw3421,sd,I have n't seen any of those .
194148,sw4379,sd,we have three children .
119885,sw2283,sd,so I do n't think I 'll have a problem .
141432,sw2025,sd,"I 'm at home with two little ki- , preschoolers ."
22059,sw2960,sd,"I watch with them every once in a while ,"
112480,sw3011,sd,"I have n't , I have n't , I have yet to see a basement in a house ."
211014,sw3169,sd,and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it .
77278,sw3074,sd,"Well , I was thinking about the other day , um , when I , when Dick and I were , oh , many , many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri , um , I went , oh ,"
13312,sw3500,sd,"And , you know , he said , I had to , he had to ear- , gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice ."
19164,sw2543,sd,"and ,"
125932,sw3791,sd,"Oh , well , anyway ."
125947,sw3791,sd,mashed potatoes .
52374,sw2803,sd,"but I just , I ca n't bring myself to trust this ,"
89875,sw2756,sd,"-- and I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico ,"
6834,sw3253,sd,we just sort of put out the sleeping roll .
1334,sw2296,sd,so I do .
57368,sw3855,sd,so we never have to pay interest
118297,sw3056,sd,and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow 's
160615,sw3419,sd,"We lived in the Chicago area at the time ,"
172767,sw3409,sd,"the only other one I have ,"
18321,sw4788,sd,"It 's not , you know , in the same category ."
212395,sw3080,sd,I 've been running since high school --
184183,sw3073,sd,Those are the two I like the best .
88644,sw2336,sd,I 'm not a real car fan .
20113,sw2478,sd,"to answer that one before we get to our subject , you know , I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was , though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money"
16357,sw3059,sd,and we probably watch twice as many movies at home --
17419,sw3042,sd,"and , and one , one week it just rained , thunderstormed for a day straight"
126426,sw3828,sd,"So ,"
188903,sw4177,sd,that satisfies most of the short term news I get .
8556,sw2528,sd,"well , they seem to be on later ,"
168903,sw2650,sd,"-- you know , but we really did n't want to keep him chained up because , you know , we feel like that 's just too restricting for him ."
4344,sw3433,sd,"Well , filling out the forms and also all of these , uh , statewide and national wide testing ,"
177445,sw2062,sd,"Well , that 's what she said to us ."
75145,sw3155,sd,"and , I tell you , we really want to go --"
48981,sw2446,sd,"and it was worked on down there , assembled , and then sent back here ,"
110606,sw2849,sd,"Because I really do n't have any , um , personal or professional or familial ties down there ."
107465,sw3596,sd,"Saturday or Sunday they were saying ,"
207891,sw3369,sd,"Uh , the story was ,"
200955,sw4342,sd,"Uh , they , uh , we , we used to have two papers here in town"
13251,sw3500,sd,they are doing so many C sections --
170704,sw3344,sd,"but , uh , unfortunately for him , but maybe fortunately for us , his health is not great ,"
208032,sw2759,sd,"and I , I know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents ,"
46973,sw2552,sd,My mother 's a school teacher
126361,sw2927,sd,"used to go on ,"
209347,sw3327,sd,it got to the point where I did n't know what was going on
171645,sw3237,sd,Brick --
167233,sw2469,sd,I do the same thing .
36096,sw3686,sd,"You take a little time , replace the bushings , you still got a perfectly good starter ."
29192,sw2292,sd,"And , uh , I especially liked the prescription , especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time ."
32725,sw3016,sd,"I think that is so stupid , you know ,"
69263,sw2617,sd,"And I just , I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid ,"
16447,sw3136,sd,"and they look like a lily , sort of ."
81742,sw2434,sd,"Uh , but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons ."
61730,sw2619,sd,"Well , we do have the two liter soda pop bottles ."
131921,sw2984,sd,"but , I do n't know if it was from the , the , the late freezes that were , or the early freezes we had , that caused this tree damage ,"
11815,sw3554,sd,and so right downstairs there 's a facility .
188867,sw4171,sd,I do n't think so .
81731,sw2434,sd,we sold a refrigerator through it
208140,sw2759,sd,it was really very official .
101376,sw2710,sd,But they both have a lot of credit cards .
140967,sw2178,sd,"this is supposed to be a nice children 's movie , CHARLOTTE 'S WEB ."
74285,sw2719,sd,I mean weird .
2867,sw3034,sd,"Well , fortunately the Red Sox , last time I saw the paper earlier this week , were in first place and doing quite well ."
82881,sw2503,sd,"and , uh , then she recouped ."
106468,sw3675,sd,and so we pay ten percent --
38101,sw2426,sd,"I have a repairman just came ,"
13731,sw2368,sd,"gosh I remember when I was little , uh , we did n't have a ,"
7856,sw2232,sd,"I 'm not sure how we get that ,"
207056,sw3349,sd,"there 's this stuff called Wonder Under that you un- , that you iron it on"
86465,sw2479,sd,"since Galen goes to nursery school ,"
100226,sw2397,sd,"Me , too ."
25356,sw2495,sd,"I mean , hire a professional ,"
113807,sw2847,sd,"So , I 've got all the different alcoholics , what they call the blue , the blue book , the big book ,"
191163,sw3075,sd,"Well , I , I tend to , uh , take two kinds of vacations , the vacations to visit family --"
106924,sw3072,sd,"You know , I think he was n't a real mountain man ,"
62733,sw2499,sd,FREDDY 'S REVENGE PART TWENTY-FIVE or whatever .
76651,sw2365,sd,"we did the one wall but the other trim ,"
38903,sw2968,sd,I do skim over it .
164875,sw3727,sd,"We , we kind of like our boys though too ,"
125111,sw2019,sd,"You know , the first time I brought her home , she was only , uh , was it six weeks old ."
34797,sw2373,sd,so I really do n't know what he said .
154995,sw2584,sd,"but they , all the leaves turn yellow ,"
23728,sw3214,sd,"-- I know that part , probably half their money comes from these people that are saying , uh , Put my ad in your paper --"
36291,sw2389,sd,"And it was because I had worked for about nine months ,"
186818,sw4626,sd,and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope
211818,sw2107,sd,"I lost one , one time , uh ,"
179309,sw2568,sd,"God , I ca n't even remember the name ."
141550,sw2448,sd,"Well , Virginia is not a particularly rich state ,"
175644,sw3288,sd,"And the thing that they forgot to do was to , um , to also look at the hose ,"
94806,sw2485,sd,"and you would have sent , you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them ,"
197670,sw4831,sd,and all of a sudden we know we 've got changes made .
151891,sw2012,sd,And I do n't think I would have thought about that .
173844,sw3607,sd,"So , I 've just recently had to start looking at it myself ."
169792,sw2868,sd,I 'm sure .
131796,sw2984,sd,we 're going to talk about lawn and garden today .
210356,sw3304,sd,"but most ,"
179442,sw2568,sd,"It 's , it 's very , very good . Very good ."
15540,sw3166,sd,"but you had to find out what level , how many cranks they were off the bottom ."
185191,sw3506,sd,"I have to get to know this area a little better , I guess ."
173769,sw3809,sd,and she still works everyday
88765,sw2336,sd,"That 's happened to me once ,"
1225,sw4666,sd,and he 's --
60537,sw2433,sd,"and I try to walk , um , at least five times a week ."
121209,sw2187,sd,and I 'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good .
163849,sw2653,sd,and then I was a scientist over in central research labs
168183,sw3068,sd,"An , and , I mean , choosing from my experience , you know , I thought , you know , my , I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want ."
208921,sw3508,sd,but I do n't use as many of those .
40794,sw3455,sd,"I heard it was , uh , sort of like , uh , not , uh , too violent ,"
197875,sw2145,sd,"So , and I would be glad to see that ."
41236,sw2234,sd,"and I enjoy , I enjoy living here in this country"
195251,sw4378,sd,"It was sort of just , you know , uh , gets your , get his , you know , my bro- , my brother and well , maybe , you know , my cousin 's coming over today to help us do that --"
52433,sw2803,sd,"and they was saying that , uh ,"
39710,sw2935,sd,"He thought , what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with ?"
187405,sw3315,sd,my name is Leslie .
184203,sw3073,sd,"I 'm sorry they 're breaking the team up , because we liked all the ones that were on there ."
88728,sw2336,sd,"but to pay that much money for an automobile , uh , is just ,"
190623,sw2593,sd,It 's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend .
166306,sw2784,sd,I do n't know what that would be .
76579,sw2365,sd,-- and she wanted to paint the shed
125803,sw3791,sd,I do n't like to cook .
203873,sw2604,sd,"And but then they lost ,"
137023,sw3050,sd,"It 's just like I , I do n't watch the ball die ,"
70053,sw2486,sd,and they were n't overly revealing .
134073,sw2999,sd,Like I 've had things that I did n't get billed on for two or three months .
91562,sw2285,sd,"They set up kids with elderly people , in the winter time they shovel their snow ."
6570,sw3189,sd,"-- and that 's in New York ,"
152350,sw2171,sd,But I do n't .
123799,sw3797,sd,The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown --
197166,sw4877,sd,They 're not even there yet --
105804,sw2616,sd,"And , uh , but at least it was , it was over quick"
97774,sw2648,sd,"and , and this , and this article said that they 've got a real problem that , um , you 've got toxins and , and , uh , bacteria in the manure that is ,"
66526,sw2521,sd,"But , I mean , I do n't know whether they have one of the first , you know ,"
188901,sw4177,sd,"I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I , I pretty much read that cover to cover"
138827,sw2086,sd,and we had a garden
199027,sw2539,sd,I go to L S U .
29409,sw3764,sd,and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that --
105496,sw3355,sd,and I get a little bit more time .
7054,sw3019,sd,"Well , she was grumpy to begin with ."
169349,sw3099,sd,"Uh , but I am trying to , you know , leave her a fair amount , even at this young age , with her grandparents , just to ,"
133877,sw2999,sd,Because they 're just so well set up with it .
31582,sw3527,sd,there is a machine that will --
133305,sw2387,sd,"I thought maybe you lived in Dallas , because that 's the complaint I make to my husband about the radio station too ."
54945,sw2175,sd,"but I have my own policy , too ."
73251,sw3750,sd,and we loved it .
172245,sw2139,sd,and what kind of money do you make
196880,sw4096,sd,and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house
69985,sw3539,sd,"I still just do n't do n't end up going cause it is n't at a convenient time or I do n't know something ,"
92639,sw2676,sd,It was interesting .
131587,sw3003,sd,"I mean it 's , we take it everywhere ,"
177065,sw4886,sd,"after we had the house part made , we just decided we 'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less ."
105493,sw3355,sd,"and so I 'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band , not the symphony , with just the city band --"
74687,sw2445,sd,there 's no bugs .
136207,sw2652,sd,"so I wear a lot of blue jeans ,"
188371,sw4339,sd,-- and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago .
203915,sw2604,sd,"Well , my dad 's in the , in the solar energy business ,"
46196,sw3104,sd,and she got really the same basic education that she wanted .
168054,sw3328,sd,the state did n't have any money
76393,sw3124,sd,So there were things around there .
192884,sw3435,sd,"when I go out and play golf it 's usually like at a , at one of these par threes that ,"
181796,sw3633,sd,"Well , really ,"
167118,sw3041,sd,It made us think .
136127,sw3291,sd,"and in the last few years I 've said , no way ."
132084,sw2185,sd,"and know if I look underneath my cabinets , I 'm not satisfied with the jobs I , I did on it because there 're splotches ."
52080,sw3709,sd,"I use to play an instrument when I was in high school ,"
60913,sw2423,sd,You might put them in the ground just the first week of June --
25985,sw2967,sd,"Well , I think they are a lot better than they us , than they were ,"
211865,sw2107,sd,Other than that he gets scared to death .
175181,sw2970,sd,we had never been there .
145454,sw2641,sd,"and , , she pushes the other one away from the food ."
21940,sw3255,sd,"Oh , close to five minutes , I believe ."
158940,sw3663,sd,"uh , the international headquarters for Wycliff Bible Translators is right here in , in Dallas ."
178565,sw2547,sd,"And , and , uh , that 's pretty much all the houses in the area , for probably a square mile , I 'd say , at least , maybe even a little bit more than that ."
11466,sw3760,sd,"Uh , I have one that I was reading on , uh , raising your children and then another one on a , an autobiography , and another one on , uh , uh , uh , like a crime story ."
210101,sw2370,sd,"in my case , I just , uh , decided that , as long as my kids were little , I would be better off at home with them , instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once ."
127972,sw3556,sd,"in fact I 'm glad that it 's part of our , uh , basic cable package ."
183927,sw4334,sd,"generally ,"
199842,sw2399,sd,"But , uh , but I knew that it was paid ."
54909,sw2175,sd,and he 's out of the house .
141415,sw2025,sd,"so everybody ,"
64949,sw2782,sd,so .
161194,sw3332,sd,"For example down here , when you go up to a gas station --"
68960,sw3187,sd,and I 've got little children here who needed me here --
42380,sw3751,sd,"So , once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty-five ."
132502,sw2663,sd,I see it here at T I .
30779,sw2982,sd,"And , they , they pay him as a consultant but he does n't get any health benefits ,"
3151,sw2125,sd,well I got married last summer
199029,sw2539,sd,"Uh , communications ."
14502,sw2888,sd,"I know in Dallas you can probably get two , two all news radio stations out of I do n't how many popular radio stations ."
76861,sw3811,sd,"But , uh , they have a pretty good size waiting list ."
37228,sw2562,sd,"That what the look like ,"
542,sw2278,sd,and --
56050,sw2994,sd,and I do n't know anybody that takes that .
141032,sw2221,sd,"Well , you know , they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers --"
53738,sw3221,sd,and --
150925,sw3313,sd,"and I , I really do n't know what , what can be done ."
212115,sw2107,sd,It was so funny .
3769,sw3813,sd,"I mean , I unconsciously , uh , you know , stay in a , within a , with a certain amount because I , I have enough food already stored here --"
185416,sw4108,sd,"and , what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now"
35914,sw2689,sd,"we live in a little small town ,"
133960,sw2999,sd,"and I was out of the country and got back ,"
118065,sw2575,sd,"So , I joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years ."
210837,sw4099,sd,I only do it probably two or three times a week .
205034,sw3427,sd,but I 've got eight more payments
8381,sw2528,sd,I keep forgetting one station .
22220,sw2960,sd,"I , I get kind of , uh , saying , `` I am sorry kids , this is '' ,"
134210,sw3039,sd,We 're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now .
124960,sw2996,sd,"And then with the with the twenty-two dollars and the seven something , it all came out to , I , I ended up paying like thirty-four dollars ."
1516,sw2325,sd,"Well , you know , there was kind of a connotation there of him being , you know , it being a problem ."
87141,sw3200,sd,"But to , to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes I 'll spend less on groceries but we 'll go out ."
102991,sw4660,sd,"An- , but I ca n't stay up late at night to watch the late news"
103342,sw4149,sd,"and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we 're going to spend and set that money aside ,"
7949,sw2770,sd,"My pet , uh , was hit by a car New Year 's Eve ,"
197678,sw4831,sd,"and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if , if I --"
187911,sw4353,sd,"I , I work also ,"
182122,sw2554,sd,"the French occupied it ,"
1533,sw2325,sd,It was expensive .
78910,sw3450,sd,so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play
9613,sw3903,sd,"and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my , my children and also things that my wife and I like to do --"
137264,sw3543,sd,"it , it , sort of does n't much , you know ,"
175361,sw2970,sd,That is probably one of the most --
83754,sw4698,sd,"I did my Master 's thesis on , uh , a typewriter ."
136528,sw3000,sd,"You do feel like you 've gone out , you know , and done something ,"
137448,sw2585,sd,"and I sort of , I see perspectives on all sides ."
151504,sw3047,sd,"So , there ,"
35229,sw2993,sd,"I wish I would , you know , I could settle for twenty-eight ,"
100806,sw2832,sd,and it did this .
7826,sw2232,sd,"democratic formed government ,"
210892,sw4099,sd,"I know I have to do more aerobics ,"
180731,sw3311,sd,"We stayed at ,"
171936,sw3325,sd,"and he 's a good dog ,"
207131,sw3349,sd,from New Mexico .
137608,sw2585,sd,the kids I 've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking .
42976,sw3810,sd,"I , my friend is , is very generous in , in letting us have my children , uh , do the Suzuki method --"
27286,sw3271,sd,"and he would sleep with her ,"
168639,sw2650,sd,So this is just really strange .
137758,sw3626,sd,"Uh , I 've , I 've got one at home too ."
8350,sw2534,sd,"They 've got great big ears ,"
66102,sw2913,sd,"Um , my husband bought me , like , um , uh , I think PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday ."
191507,sw3445,sd,but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad .
109805,sw2300,sd,but I 'm not interested because we 're moving out of the house next year .
26265,sw3711,sd,We said things like spaghetti .
35510,sw3272,sd,"So , I guess I really have no fear at all of the U S S R verses , uh ,"
117804,sw2514,sd,"I was there before that ,"
133376,sw2387,sd,"and I said , then when , when it 's born you can hold it --"
205143,sw2708,sd,and she 's training her .
28407,sw4822,sd,"I , I think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I do n't know ."
181487,sw4092,sd,I have been to a concert a couple of times of hers .
72996,sw3606,sd,"But , um , oh , just phenomenal ,"
196336,sw2095,sd,"And , uh , this year it 's been so hot and , uh , sunny"
113300,sw2969,sd,"We bought a , a large house that was completely unlandscaped ."
13995,sw3326,sd,We had a boat
210748,sw3138,sd,they get enough sugar and --
160437,sw2427,sd,They have some little buds on them hopefully they 'll do something .
163276,sw2842,sd,"and when , whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays , we 'll see other families ."
110991,sw3453,sd,"so he always said why do n't you drive a Ford , or why do n't you try a Lincoln --"
122897,sw3659,sd,She 'd go up and down with her little bag --
101457,sw2710,sd,"And I think they 're getting ready to , to probably sell us out , our division ."
34031,sw2190,sd,"and , uh , that was really quite dangerous ,"
9182,sw2871,sd,I did n't get to see that .
56247,sw3185,sd,"But I did a walk last night ,"
70331,sw2792,sd,"I 'm , I 'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that ."
151558,sw3398,sd,I 'm not home a lot .
127462,sw2726,sd,"God , I ca n't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff"
77892,sw3988,sd,I have a couple that my husband really hates --

62730,sw2499,sd,"Number nine , number ten , number --"

65924,sw4023,sd,I 've been pretty lucky about getting mugged .

3372,sw2614,sd,"but , uh , uh , it is sad ."

160820,sw2262,sd,"She said they could n't see those things out there ,"
111281,sw3368,sd,It takes a lot .

115483,sw2085,sd,"Well , we keep a shelter , also monies that we 're going to pay in for child care too ."
167702,sw2615,sd,So they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics ca n't do much with them .
47810,sw3118,sd,And they have to stay in until they all agree --
54999,sw3624,sd,-- and I run a municipal band

69113,sw3377,sd,Usually January and the first two weeks of February .
165891,sw3206,sd,"But they have been more , little more s- , effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it ."

90885,sw2252,sd,"well , uh , I , I guess , what they 'd have to do to ,"

26480,sw3013,sd,"I don- , I do n't know if you 've ever made them , maybe not since you do n't have kids yet , but those Jell-O , uh , gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers , I ca n't think of what they call it ."
179420,sw2568,sd,But it was kind of cute .
145418,sw2641,sd,"just the smell is so bad ,"
91907,sw2566,sd,and she turned out to be wonderful .
212354,sw3080,sd,I 'm twenty-two .
103371,sw4149,sd,"I said a couple of kids ,"
95922,sw4026,sd,"And plus the place that I 'd bought them all had gone out of business ,"
137764,sw3626,sd,"My job is , uh , E D P auditor ,"
19048,sw2543,sd,I do n't .
176227,sw4697,sd,"-- we , we a- , rendered a verdict"
203410,sw2837,sd,"When , uh , I met my husband , he was living in an apartment at the time"
171777,sw3237,sd,-- I have two dogs .
170293,sw3655,sd,"I feel such a responsibility , even when we go out for a few hours that ,"
9043,sw3956,sd,"and , uh , and every year we get another list of what doctor 's we can go to , and where we can buy our medicine ,"
207101,sw3349,sd,and --
61705,sw2619,sd,A quantum leap from left to right hand drive .
37093,sw3270,sd,"when you think about people , uh , taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress ."
193228,sw3156,sd,"But when it comes down to just general purpose trash , that all the houses , uh ,"
61767,sw3746,sd,but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area .
95450,sw2785,sd,"We also grow , um , yellow and green squash ,"
83957,sw2465,sd,"I learned so many things that they , they do ,"
144619,sw3082,sd,-- and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time --
21932,sw3255,sd,"Uh , other than that , uh , I do n't know ,"
35167,sw2993,sd,"about a year ago , we picked up a second hand , uh , uh , Audi --"
115556,sw2085,sd,"Well , they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago , you know , in the public schools ."
107669,sw2992,sd,"-- and , um , I think it was on , I have to remember which channel ,"
44792,sw3965,sd,and I really love it . Um .
134252,sw3039,sd,it is .
82431,sw2131,sd,"Oh , I could never do that ."
63809,sw2177,sd,"Now I 've seen another clip of , um , the guy that plays in MURPHY BROWN ,"
169993,sw3070,sd,So we 're talking about second and third great children here .
128183,sw2122,sd,"Well , uh , for us it 's , uh , uh , you know , it 's like for doing like , you know , like resumes ,"
26585,sw2064,sd,"so I do n't even know what the law is ,"
16269,sw3059,sd,"Uh , but on the other hand , I 'm not sure I would have gone otherwise ,"
151808,sw2589,sd,they get one of these caught being good slips .
156403,sw2932,sd,I was working at the Dallas site .
190414,sw4318,sd,I would really like to have a sports car .
152281,sw2171,sd,"like I do some volunteer work here and there ,"
135065,sw3105,sd,"and they had told their teachers that wh- , I mean ,"
197677,sw4831,sd,"But I , I do kind of like to know what 's going on and what 's happening"
116366,sw2287,sd,he sure did .
68826,sw2645,sd,"So , despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or , or going for walks in the mountains ,"
38585,sw3496,sd,"And second time we went to Munich , Germany and were there a week , and loved Germany ."
208421,sw2290,sd,"They say it 's a dog fish , from everything I 've described ,"
136495,sw3000,sd,"But , uh , it 's , so it 's very , very mixed"
204085,sw2406,sd,"Latest , latest one I 've saw which was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART ,"
197509,sw3467,sd,"I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes , too ."
5913,sw3228,sd,"but the language in it is just for no reason , has to stick in ,"
65785,sw3768,sd,"I mean , they 're not used to having tourists there ,"
7892,sw2232,sd,"It would look absolutely , ridiculously stupid ,"
128069,sw3556,sd,"I came down March of sixty-nine , went to work for T and I ."
59526,sw3723,sd,I was suffering for about three weeks later .
34560,sw3647,sd,"and that 's , that 's one thing I do have ."
197055,sw3389,sd,"I , I watched that game"
94267,sw2602,sd,Inflation is out of this world
57582,sw3694,sd,"I have n't , I have n't heard that ."
119588,sw2797,sd,"and they had , uh , ag ,"
102760,sw2102,sd,"little , with little kids the T V set really is a , I mean"
85051,sw3069,sd,"she has ,"
141749,sw2393,sd,I think it was Saint Augustine that we had .
65733,sw3768,sd,"We , um , we made a trip up the East Coast ."
214446,sw2611,sd,"But , uh , I mean , they , they just moved into the new building ,"
140736,sw4840,sd,"MUMBLEx work hard to get , you know ."
77879,sw3988,sd,-- and I like some of their songs .
35585,sw2679,sd,"we , I always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be ,"
170305,sw4347,sd,and they were real good about taking it back .
41964,sw3454,sd,"And yet , I 'm also noticing , uh , in the areas that I 'm working and stuff , more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago --"
2632,sw2289,sd,"Well , that 's , that 's a really good idea , because , um , like our , uh , fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit ."
88933,sw2565,sd,"I , I 'm living in , just west of Baltimore , and Frederick , um , which is also just west of Baltimore , has a minor league team ."
51622,sw3025,sd,"that was unusual ,"
22590,sw2353,sd,"I , I think I was paid , uh , about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year --"
33941,sw2386,sd,"Well , then forget that ,"
88877,sw3159,sd,I do that when we travel .
141694,sw2393,sd,We have n't really done too much else other than that .
168908,sw2650,sd,"Well , he kind of ripped through the chicken wire ."
125016,sw2996,sd,And people would just drink openly .
40038,sw3280,sd,I get most of my news information from T V .
6420,sw2308,sd,"if anything happens to him , I do n't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact I do n't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home ."
182994,sw3205,sd,"I was working at that time full-time and did n't have a lot of time ,"
120759,sw4675,sd,Well I guess that 's about all I can talk to about budgets .
17281,sw2191,sd,Naturally I 'm married --
155412,sw2488,sd,"and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago ,"
176089,sw3246,sd,"but supposedly they 're good ,"
177046,sw4886,sd,"so I , my , my vast experience of home , home owner 's knowledge is not very much ."
101877,sw3254,sd,"We 're usually picking things up quickly ,"
50890,sw3014,sd,"and I bought it , uh , in , uh , eighty-eight"
134208,sw3039,sd,"and , and everybody tends to be in the same boat ."
1503,sw2325,sd,The were almost all boys .
97639,sw2648,sd,I ca n't stand that
40309,sw2954,sd,And that was kind of fun .
167581,sw2615,sd,I do n't think I 'd know where to start with a diesel .
27864,sw2557,sd,"They 'll take colored folders ,"
132104,sw2185,sd,"We , we had the same type of situation ."
38520,sw3496,sd,"but , you know , we do n't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway"
155532,sw2488,sd,and the back fence was open .
70852,sw4114,sd,and they want to become industrial --
161569,sw3004,sd,which she does n't allow them to watch the soapies .
174492,sw2910,sd,"or , I , I , I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS , which is --"
30139,sw3290,sd,"So , I mean people are still wearing shorts"
198325,sw3962,sd,"So , uh , um , I try to enjoy all of it ."
193812,sw4038,sd,"Uh , it was , uh --"
154063,sw2154,sd,"Um , and it 's one of those that I can ei- , read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I 'm going to spend in there ."
66048,sw2913,sd,"well I do n't think you all have the same channels ,"
28178,sw2101,sd,I do n't have a lot of time
99803,sw2226,sd,"me , too ."
132202,sw2185,sd,"and , uh , we 're , they 'll be there for a while ."
125389,sw2631,sd,"and , uh , plus I , I , uh , wanted them to get something out of it ,"
71763,sw2858,sd,"but , um , a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more , um , where they could manage their own schedule"
139402,sw2630,sd,"and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that was n't ,"
36625,sw2457,sd,a hundred and ten degrees
182714,sw3420,sd,but it 's a little ways off in the future --
89891,sw2756,sd,"and , uh , I , uh , went to Purdue for a couple of years ,"
67524,sw2260,sd,"so ,"
24906,sw2623,sd,"In fact , I was going to school while I was working fifty-one hours a week"
162709,sw2921,sd,"That 's how bad it ,"
142457,sw4050,sd,but --
100422,sw2264,sd,"I was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time ."
138427,sw2713,sd,"I listen to ,"
60041,sw2418,sd,"She got , you know , five hundred dollars at a , at a clip through bands , through leadership ."
138782,sw2086,sd,"And , um , normally what happ , what we do is , um , just , you know , like two tablespoons of oil , maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi- , vegetable oil ."
10848,sw2090,sd,I 've only done this one other time
150947,sw3313,sd,"But nobody , nobody did anything ."
102625,sw3279,sd,"They did n't cut us off ,"
101005,sw3364,sd,"Well , I do like ALL MY CHILDREN ,"
89669,sw3081,sd,I have a recipe that 's pretty good for that .
165612,sw2717,sd,"I , I 've , I have , uh , a low tolerance for that kind of , uh , that kind of person ."
200708,sw3306,sd,Hundred miles due east of here .
43063,sw3009,sd,"But , uh , with today 's world and the kids today , uh , there 's no way , I ca n't say that I would just ask someone , you know , that I did n't know like that to baby-sit ."
27318,sw3271,sd,"and I think that 's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with , you know ."
121548,sw2027,sd,I had a friend who worked there for a year or so
165830,sw2634,sd,As it stands now I 've got to do that with a blade .
40364,sw2954,sd,And then there is wild blackberries there too .
67901,sw3628,sd,"I do n't think , uh , hardly anybody lives there ,"
202943,sw2429,sd,We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks
38116,sw2692,sd,I am .
117324,sw2642,sd,"young people if they do n't , you know ,"
125612,sw3071,sd,I was in Europe .
131525,sw3003,sd,"and I understand , it is too expensive to have two car payments ."
166184,sw2784,sd,"Uh , I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi- , military off and on over the , over the years of being called back and things of that nature , is , uh , I 've found that , you know , there 's an extraordinary amount of waste ."
115659,sw3030,sd,and so we 've gotten together
79235,sw3342,sd,I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing
58130,sw2340,sd,"they do have a wing where the people who are really sick , you know --"
214439,sw2611,sd,and he just loves it .
158610,sw2608,sd,"And fact is , we 're going to take a vacation this year ."
108233,sw3537,sd,"and , uh , she got home ,"
88138,sw3115,sd,and then there 's other departments --
20993,sw3102,sd,And I am going into my third year
83533,sw2672,sd,"And then like , the week before that , they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good , bring it in"
50939,sw3014,sd,"And , uh , I , you know , I 've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things ,"
180165,sw2627,sd,"two ,"
156675,sw4064,sd,"oh goodness , my mind has gone blank it 's , uh , Othello ."
198217,sw3083,sd,"I mean , just because their kids had the ability and the , and the drive to do , try and get an education , they did n't send him to a public school , you know ,"
211884,sw2107,sd,"Oh well he lived through it ,"
89775,sw3081,sd,"if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing , especially while you 're waiting before you serve it ."
146434,sw2965,sd,I have to call and get it fixed .
60816,sw2433,sd,"But in general I like to exer- , I , I like dance a lot ,"
76595,sw2365,sd,"you know , they ,"
132098,sw2185,sd,"I guess the , the big discussion , just kind of what you were mentioning , has been the color ."
167961,sw2111,sd,And that 's really discouraging .
156944,sw3052,sd,"and it was not a happy situation for , for any of them ."
119250,sw3845,sd,"I understand they sell it , you know , they sell names because it 's quite profitable to them ."
173268,sw3354,sd,we found them --
9763,sw3979,sd,"and it 's hard to , hard to say whether the , um , risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not ,"
33006,sw3057,sd,"I have heard horror stories ,"
26556,sw3013,sd,"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a , like a plate over the top ."
22729,sw2353,sd,"a lot of the youth that I come in contact with are , they say oh , I want to be a doctor , I want to be a lawyer ."
22424,sw3788,sd,"I , I , well , personally I 've been very diligent --"
89638,sw3728,sd,"and then you 'll hear that it , you know , they did n't , um ."
177640,sw4826,sd,"We 're from a county , we 're from the county they marched in ."
51797,sw3025,sd,"it was , he was supposed to be there at six o'clock , not seven o'clock ,"
148602,sw3236,sd,"Well , the , um , glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart ."
192505,sw4168,sd,And I --
81488,sw2434,sd,"I 've , I 've had mixed emotions , I guess , when I listen to , uh , the radio and , and watch T V about the different , uh , things that are happening ."
127571,sw2726,sd,"and I do n't , I do n't , you know really see a lot on sale or anything"
139962,sw2376,sd,"uh , it 's called the Clothes Closet ,"
136818,sw3050,sd,"and a I got a little bit better ,"
71861,sw2858,sd,"a lot of people that I work for are , mothers that stay home ."
150771,sw3207,sd,They call it senior citizen day care .
208482,sw3763,sd,"Well , I 've been kind of , been intrigued with the Rangers , uh , more so with , uh , uh , their management than anything else ."
147674,sw4785,sd,"and then I spend time with them while , you know , he 's doing other stuff ."
191103,sw4049,sd,"and I 'm just like , well , uh , I 'm not even going to think much about it --"
89836,sw3081,sd,I do n't know what you call it .
195461,sw2546,sd,"and , you know , the cop 's just got to go back and , and do his thing all over again , because so many of the crimes are , are done by repeat offenders ."
24937,sw2623,sd,It was a magic number for him
191671,sw4104,sd,"We , we 're kind of real , we 're real happy that we do n't have any debt ,"
154304,sw3776,sd,"well ,"
187722,sw3135,sd,"and our benefits for maternal and , and parental care and even for elderly people --"
135933,sw4856,sd,"I mean you take these , you know , most of the people who are committing violent crimes , most of them , not all by any means ,"
161575,sw3004,sd,"And so that ended that ,"
198553,sw2061,sd,And so he 's doing his Masters here .
154614,sw3345,sd,-- but that 's the way it goes .
207215,sw3796,sd,They won in a squeaker .
59657,sw2344,sd,"I mean , I 've heard stories now where the , where the , um , the military is running around ,"
44829,sw3965,sd,"-- so I took a pattern off of that ,"
135945,sw4856,sd,"Uh , her husband just killed her"
151464,sw3047,sd,I did n't know that .
66610,sw2521,sd,but I do n't like the Broncos .
151160,sw3062,sd,"And she said , you know , we , we were going to call you if you had n't called us ."
160717,sw2262,sd,"I mean , I 'm living in Dallas now ."
54369,sw2879,sd,"I meant living in Texas ,"
104133,sw3049,sd,I want to go see that .
139235,sw2630,sd,and he liked them .
1939,sw2788,sd,we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something .
77815,sw2501,sd,"The only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood- , uh , the door frames ,"
160090,sw2427,sd,"And I wal- , I mow my own lawn ."
41468,sw3204,sd,"but , uh , I think it would be nice"
190441,sw4318,sd,"and I was looking for , uh , dependability and something that was going to last a long time . I was g , that I would get a , for the money that I was going to spend , that I would get a return that was , that was worth that money ."
64889,sw2782,sd,"so . But , um , that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , for- , that are more , you know , nonessential items ."
56686,sw3076,sd,"In the past , um , three years I 've had three different addresses ."
135653,sw2586,sd,Take a picnic lunch .
166404,sw2860,sd,"so we , we would always go in for the museums ."
182876,sw2761,sd,"well , we do n't either ,"
131226,sw3018,sd,that 's the only thing .
16464,sw3136,sd,and we ca n't seem to get ours green .
41078,sw2234,sd,"Well , my family moved to Texas about eight years ago ."
109275,sw3399,sd,"And even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in the , the management ladder --"
180518,sw3311,sd,"Uh , Tempe ."
188822,sw4171,sd,"and , and I had a high deductible on the on the , uh , on the c- , car insurance"
179631,sw3015,sd,"the , the deductibles did n't apply ."
41884,sw3181,sd,"So I think , not only does it help my body ,"
189640,sw4830,sd,"So , I mean , his appeal was denied"
122838,sw3659,sd,"But I could certainly have , uh , three bins out there for , you know , plastic and --"
6412,sw2308,sd,"I mean , she cries every day ."
53934,sw2155,sd,"So they still had , they had , and they had people who came in who , um , supervised , th- , all these houses ,"
66394,sw2521,sd,They are .
56434,sw2227,sd,He goes do you want to dance .
108713,sw2515,sd,"and so pretty much now , uh , we do n't use them too much ."
185877,sw2945,sd,"and now she 's staying home all the time ,"
192184,sw2789,sd,"Oh , I still do n't ,"
4687,sw2711,sd,"we usually try and drive up there , oh , once every year or two ."
126558,sw3464,sd,"Uh , uh , uh , recently I , I 've seen , uh , the FISHER KING ."
183052,sw4358,sd,"They ,"
85771,sw4311,sd,"so you meet the standards ,"
88973,sw2565,sd,"I mean , he , you know , he ca n't field"
96783,sw2299,sd,"I , I like it ,"
197987,sw2028,sd,"and , and , uh , very windy ."
9370,sw2871,sd,"That 's why , I ,"
175722,sw3288,sd,"so I 've been thinking , especially now is a good time to buy a car ."
136295,sw2652,sd,"And it 's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff , I know ."
77828,sw2501,sd,"But they had not ,"
168899,sw2650,sd,He did it again --
193312,sw4127,sd,"Uh , I do n't even use a calculator for the stuff I 'm doing because it 's all pretty round numbers ."
93342,sw2828,sd,"but Texas , uh , adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade ."
156833,sw2678,sd,"Uh , in fact they have , they have a continuous news station , which is nice if you 're driving and you want to h ,"
56294,sw3185,sd,"I guess my , my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six , and then probably seventy-five during the day ."
183480,sw4048,sd,"I know one employee ,"
196267,sw4333,sd,"Well , that might be the difference ."
129905,sw2736,sd,and it was a big car .
138038,sw2248,sd,"w- , we went like twenty or thirty at a time ."
55871,sw2983,sd,"He , he 'll come home though , and he 'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds ,"

87950,sw2163,sd,"It 's too easy to , to run into the gas station ."

181371,sw3067,sd,-- you do not really feel that that really close to them .
112258,sw2519,sd,"but , I used to watch all those exercise programs on T V ,"
16545,sw3136,sd,"It just really ,"
56843,sw3076,sd,-- and Dick Thornburg who 's now the attorney general --

97365,sw3403,sd,"in fact , on the news tonight , Nolan Ryan was on there ."

2846,sw3034,sd,"but I , I enjoy the ,"
113031,sw2579,sd,"but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes , uh , a perpetual problem ."

140418,sw4821,sd,I come from the east coast
203991,sw3495,sd,"I know , like a week or so ago ,"

123408,sw2482,sd,Getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all
98287,sw2008,sd,"you know , like right now , today was in about , you know , the fifties ."
175460,sw2331,sd,"but , uh --"
34208,sw2190,sd,"so we get away from the , the smog ."
60445,sw3260,sd,"My daughter and , and I hate camping so we go shopping ."
132217,sw2185,sd,"like , like , uh , I 've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because , they , they really did n't match ."
171502,sw2439,sd,And they just laughed at me .
211554,sw3925,sd,"I think the first thing they said ,"

30466,sw3226,sd,-- he 's got a new partner .
119088,sw3898,sd,I used to go there when I was in college .

98372,sw3660,sd,"It 's , it 's not a random --"
50029,sw2862,sd,"-- they were all like , uh , like six eight and , uh , you know , six ten ,"
131136,sw3018,sd,so I like to watch that
163529,sw2909,sd,but --
139320,sw2630,sd,"Uh , in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it , he could probably slip"
102937,sw4660,sd,but my wife is usually up then
21748,sw2437,sd,it 's not firing first .
81790,sw2441,sd,my father had been in the military .
209053,sw2548,sd,I love it though .

173209,sw3354,sd,"and I , I mow it , uh , you know , with a mulch mower so the , the particles fall down --"
173896,sw3607,sd,and then you patch them up .
188581,sw3917,sd,they had to do as much as we did .
147010,sw3103,sd,"And , uh , the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman , they expect me to be more motherly ,"
162300,sw3175,sd,"And , uh , especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses"

25855,sw2898,sd,"I never been in a bask- , football game in high school that had that many ."
160265,sw2427,sd,I had a dump truck come and dump it .
207789,sw3146,sd,"and it had strawberries , kiwis , and raspberries --"
95927,sw4026,sd,it 's frustrating .

175612,sw2331,sd,and I did n't get it done .
74424,sw2800,sd,"Well , that 's kind of the way we were doing"
74400,sw2800,sd,and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping .
44069,sw2955,sd,"You know , and I do n't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there ."
34670,sw2293,sd,"but , I do n't know what they can do to really prevent it , you know ."
176294,sw4314,sd,"I did n't see any boats there , though ."
63874,sw2177,sd,"And that I could n't watch ,"
89920,sw2756,sd,I 've never been there .
1463,sw2325,sd,So I 've had to deal a lot with child care
6360,sw2308,sd,"And he was saying his excuses , if you move her some place else , the people might not be so nice ."
106300,sw2806,sd,"That was another funny thing ,"
1608,sw2325,sd,and then Friday my husband and I split .
83350,sw2703,sd,I 'll have to tell my son about that .
36027,sw2689,sd,"I do n't , I do n't know what they can do ."
83162,sw2703,sd,so . And I have n't been back to Des Moines in a long time .
132869,sw4443,sd,"and I , I --"
51032,sw3014,sd,"That 's a ,"
131659,sw3003,sd,"and you know , my B M W that my husband was going forty to forty-five miles an hour"
187909,sw4353,sd,"But he was with another company before that ,"
141524,sw2448,sd,"and you get your gwu- , your gun right then and there ."
122492,sw3384,sd,"But again I miss ,"
122447,sw3384,sd,"I mean , well , I did n't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent"
200119,sw2729,sd,"he 's got a full , a pure bred Golden Retriever"
79847,sw4796,sd,"Ever since I was a young and , uh , used to watch the old , uh , Apollo missions going off in , uh , classroom T V -s ."
99590,sw2226,sd,And it also teaches them spiritual warfare --
135475,sw2661,sd,"but then there 's a place up the pass , up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings , drive , drive up to , I think it 's about eight thousand foot elevation ."
4125,sw2506,sd,my friend talked me in that .
148894,sw3338,sd,"Seattle is only about two and a half hours ,"
72921,sw3606,sd,he 'll be a year old in January .
78330,sw3551,sd,"you may have half literature for the whole year ,"
202670,sw3219,sd,"-- but now that I 've broken away from it , I 'm , I 'm glad I have ."
133658,sw2235,sd,"and I believe we would have , because God 's really put it in our heart not to get in debt , you know ."
69535,sw3569,sd,"when it first happened it was , he was guilty , he was guilty , he was guilty ."
165116,sw3720,sd,"and that 's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son ,"
132077,sw2185,sd,It was not real pretty .
164747,sw4008,sd,I 've never used an I B M actually .
140115,sw2570,sd,"I 'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these , you know , knit these things"
7041,sw3019,sd,"and , I want you to know that became the most suspicious , cantankerous , contrary old woman ever walked ."
177923,sw2658,sd,we told them about the stuff
209317,sw3327,sd,"and then I got there and tried to ,"
78971,sw3450,sd,"so we have n't got to use it much ,"
6564,sw3189,sd,"but it 's always like the second week in September ,"
160676,sw3419,sd,and I love .
36645,sw2457,sd,like you say coming a little bit further up north .
147457,sw2490,sd,and he showed me how to use his guns
166807,sw2866,sd,"and , uh , uh , the other one is , uh , uh , her husband is in the m- , Navy"
56632,sw2227,sd,"And so then I said , I 'm going to move back up there to go to college ."
206350,sw3152,sd,"it 's like Elijah , or something like that ."
188313,sw2184,sd,"I guess it was like eighty-four , eighty-five --"
199258,sw4137,sd,"Uh , ca n't afford it ."
114284,sw2431,sd,"that 's , you know , it 's been four years ago ,"
175963,sw3246,sd,"and the , the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much"
132086,sw2185,sd,"But , I 'm glad it 's done , because it 's brighter ."
187497,sw3315,sd,"And if I can stay up late enough , I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then ."
206484,sw3152,sd,I feel like I 've learned a lot about the piano .
3580,sw2638,sd,"I have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy ,"
141143,sw2221,sd,"And , uh , they can put a ,"
163051,sw2874,sd,"We have , uh , some friends who live on the lake --"
142044,sw3020,sd,"Uh , we went home to visit family ."
84398,sw2382,sd,it is .

15516,sw3166,sd,personally I like to catch large mouth bass --
51707,sw3025,sd,"Uh , and , uh , then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time ."
155443,sw2488,sd,"I have , I have my doubts , you know ."
181638,sw2896,sd,I 'm going to put wood in there .
64530,sw4691,sd,there 's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games .
176945,sw2998,sd,"one is already in college in New England ,"
69651,sw3111,sd,"uh , well , if we have one murder a year --"
66201,sw2913,sd,he shaved the beard off .
82338,sw2131,sd,"but , uh , I grew up with country and western ,"
9119,sw2871,sd,and I liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it .
181427,sw4092,sd,"-- you know , they have that type of music ,"
175704,sw3288,sd,so is mine .
182518,sw4649,sd,"and , uh , the child care center associated with our university was quite good"
159313,sw2526,sd,"and no other responsibilities for yourself , I guess , you know , it 's , I can ,"
53810,sw2155,sd,"And I have known , you know , people close to me that have been in all three ,"
82349,sw2131,sd,"so , uh , the only , we only had one radio station"
89148,sw2599,sd,It 's .
39988,sw2511,sd,"so , that 's one , one way he looked at it ."
171104,sw2790,sd,"and almost all the people that I clean for , believe it or not , are mothers that do n't work ."
54552,sw2879,sd,"and , uh , now the Air Force is the largest employer in the , uh , area"
209674,sw2305,sd,but it 's such a grind --
116553,sw3131,sd,"I know a little bit more from a , a co-worker ."
189765,sw4340,sd,"Then , you know , there 's been guys in jail for six years"
8997,sw3956,sd,"and they closed ,"
6846,sw3253,sd,I love to walk --
175794,sw3288,sd,"but I , I think I 'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to , to go have it done now"
196440,sw2095,sd,my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye .
161062,sw3451,sd,This was last year .
78889,sw3450,sd,"and I do n't really get out a lot to , because my job , to , to exercise ."
169153,sw2316,sd,"We , uh , our town did n't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many , many years just because people are , are in the recession"
129721,sw2736,sd,"-- uh , I 've been really pleased with its performance and with the size"
57913,sw3448,sd,"But , I 've been , I , I 've been away too long ."
81981,sw2441,sd,"And when , uh , when come time to get out of school , I thought , Boy , I 'd like to teach ."
169991,sw3070,sd,and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties .
210219,sw2370,sd,but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him --
23515,sw3567,sd,"It 's , it 's a close subject right now ."
144716,sw3584,sd,Because it 's not a full two story .
152421,sw2171,sd,I get free money for thirty days .
134000,sw2999,sd,"I pay I think ,"
36292,sw2389,sd,and when they were coming home I was going to work .
204119,sw2406,sd,and he got killed .
122796,sw3659,sd,I 've seen those .
101059,sw3364,sd,"And then , and then , uh , , uh , the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART ."
33286,sw3276,sd,And how they can do it I have no idea .
187469,sw3315,sd,"Uh , I do n't even know , to tell you the truth ."
197029,sw3389,sd,"and from what I saw the game Houston , Houston impressed me a lot ."
106324,sw2806,sd,"he 'd , he 'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door , if you happened to close it on him or something , you know ,"
74726,sw2445,sd,but they 're suppose to work really well .
175547,sw2331,sd,"We get a mixed league in ,"
11938,sw4165,sd,my involvement has n't been direct
108876,sw3194,sd,"but that goes out with the trash ,"
101872,sw3254,sd,"But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks ,"
199521,sw2628,sd,"And then when everything 's set up , then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with ,"
202858,sw2429,sd,"Because , I mean , crawfish , everybody over here likes crawfish"
154445,sw2603,sd,"but i- , it 's , it 's at least something ."
9094,sw3956,sd,and the people do n't want to hire people this age any more .
36557,sw2457,sd,"I just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass , you know ."
96562,sw2851,sd,"-- an awful lot of people know where it is , or have been there ."
141697,sw2393,sd,So we did n't have any lawn and garden type duties .
64242,sw3525,sd,"I have a brother-in-law who is , uh , an ex-college coach and like a pro"
140966,sw2178,sd,"He just was beside himself , you know ,"
177595,sw4826,sd,"For example , I have a brother in North Carolina"
71776,sw2858,sd,"I do n't , I do n't have that choice ."
39403,sw2693,sd,I feel like it 's a treat .
106176,sw2806,sd,"and anyway , he just , he went and found this guy in , in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in , I guess in Te- , in Mexico ,"
60958,sw2423,sd,"but when we got hired here , no , no , never any layoffs , never , never ,"
44369,sw3703,sd,"And that is really super kind of stuff , too . Take , if you like Continental at all --"
206630,sw3682,sd,and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice .
124142,sw3777,sd,I always liked that one .
36146,sw3686,sd,"So , I 've been around cars a lot , but , uh , driven a lot of old Pontiacs ."
202625,sw3219,sd,but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly .
92824,sw2598,sd,"We , we saw , an , we liked it"
85913,sw2421,sd,"they go to our church ,"
41054,sw3570,sd,", uh ,"
80722,sw2121,sd,"I 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now , and , and what the amount of material that they do , uh , put into the atmosphere ."
105409,sw3355,sd,"so , but he , he 's real unusual in that , uh ,"
194044,sw3707,sd,"Well , we 've heard bad , we 've heard some bad things about some of those , you know ,"
109670,sw2300,sd,"and , uh , he was a little late graduating ,"
122782,sw3659,sd,"Uh , she 's not here anymore --"
1700,sw2325,sd,And the hours are wonderful
83884,sw2465,sd,"I have one at , uh ,"
130873,sw3340,sd,"but , he 's still not back where he was ."
24661,sw2623,sd,"but it was , uh , more an impact , I think , on the oldest two ."
7086,sw3019,sd,"I had forgotten about that ,"
112128,sw2989,sd,"But , it 's been an interesting , uh , roughly , oh , nine months here ,"
203363,sw4101,sd,"Uh , I guess partly because of our climate ."
71621,sw2220,sd,So we 're in Garland .
18733,sw4703,sd,Or you 've had a cold
3848,sw3813,sd,"and , uh , I , I keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account"
4681,sw2711,sd,I think my parents took me there when I was real young .
166870,sw2866,sd,"well I know both of my kids did n't want to live anywhere around the , the downtown areas ,"
11669,sw3841,sd,"and it 's a public system , however , you 'd think that it was a private school , because I take it , the best teachers and the best students ,"
84651,sw2113,sd,but that was n't it .
105148,sw3372,sd,"I have n't personally ever been tested ,"
154039,sw2154,sd,"but I , I think it helps me everyday in trying to review wh- , the state that the world is in and try to guess where we 're going ."
28742,sw2924,sd,"Still way up north , sort of , um ."
132189,sw2185,sd,"It 's like , they 're dark ."
108609,sw3359,sd,"well , but that , that stuff is , goes one notch beyond , uh ,"
129493,sw2926,sd,and we did it --
206634,sw3682,sd,"It 's , that was one of the first things I made for my husband , because I was like , um ,"
68515,sw3497,sd,"I mean , it 's , like , really humid"
97554,sw3503,sd,And there is a number of questions
188814,sw4171,sd,"uh , on the other hand , you know , I , I had a similar , had a similar health plan"
101822,sw3254,sd,Or we eat junk food at home --
136855,sw3050,sd,"Oh , that 's my favorite kind to play ."
181843,sw3633,sd,"and , uh , less than a week later the arm was broken ."
60126,sw2418,sd,The reality of it is it 's tough .
4446,sw2168,sd,"And then we , you know , we investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it ."

35761,sw2679,sd,"Uh , uh , I do n't know , uh ."
78089,sw2609,sd,That would make me happy though .
18496,sw4814,sd,"when you think of some of the best presidents we 've had , in the past , have been people that have struggled to get to the top ."
90308,sw4071,sd,"and we have what we call the five B s . Uh , th- , for our taxes . Booze , uh , butts , cigarettes , beds , uh , hotel room tax --"

6593,sw3189,sd,"I kind of missed it this year , and felt bad ,"
151557,sw3398,sd,"and at the time that I bought this one it was just a , a much better arrangement for me personally ."
157080,sw2571,sd,"Um , there was a crime here in McKinney ,"
102832,sw2102,sd,"My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties ,"

20781,sw3102,sd,I forgot
158455,sw2608,sd,but I have had shrimp .
130533,sw3371,sd,"but it is because we , uh , came to this area about the same time ."
57936,sw3414,sd,So they knew that there was something going on here .
46420,sw3747,sd,Baroque and romantic .
76454,sw3124,sd,and the weather got warm so quick --
181841,sw3633,sd,"-- my three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll ,"

34469,sw3647,sd,"Utah , I 've had a couple of ,"
25370,sw2495,sd,but one had more blue to it .
196245,sw4333,sd,"For instance , like Social Security tax or Soc- , uh ,"
9332,sw2871,sd,that was great .
168586,sw2826,sd,she needed to work
184198,sw3073,sd,but we like L A LAW .
126621,sw3464,sd,I 'm much the same way .
161568,sw3004,sd,"Her , her one son was watching the soapies"
2180,sw2788,sd,"But then I , I foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but , you know ,"
10664,sw2090,sd,and I enjoy reading and playing softball .
162029,sw3533,sd,"and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends ,"

191834,sw4327,sd,"yet , you go out on the streets"
36160,sw3686,sd,"and suddenly it , it , it drops off fast ,"
76047,sw2334,sd,for the green card .
104939,sw2938,sd,So that kind of threw them off .
5724,sw3228,sd,It 's one of my --
106843,sw2450,sd,I could stand this all summer .
156515,sw3375,sd,"Well I , I know , uh , where I came from . We did n't have a very , uh , rich community"
163609,sw2909,sd,"You know , and then , and Eduardo Mana 's from Mexico"
167693,sw2615,sd,"and , you know , you can see the three spark plugs there in the front ."
106330,sw2806,sd,and you could just vacuum it up .
12191,sw2827,sd,I mean I 'm always willing to try anything usually .
67529,sw2260,sd,"I 'm , uh , turning in a capital request right now ,"
123811,sw3797,sd,"We 're burning fuel oil and a few other things ,"
118783,sw2900,sd,"my mother and father both , uh , uh ,"
42065,sw3716,sd,"and what is funny is that you use , uh , bran , all bran --"
42311,sw3751,sd,I do a matter of fact .
78898,sw3450,sd,And I realize that .
143045,sw2405,sd,"I mean , it was like a necessity ."
205613,sw4908,sd,"Uh , around here we have a program where , uh , we , we put out the , the , we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers ."
194006,sw3707,sd,-- and she still feels good .
35330,sw3257,sd,something that 's kind of more of a comedy .
115552,sw2085,sd,"Well , you know , in a situation like that , I do n't know if that 's good or bad ."
116883,sw3096,sd,"I thought , well , at least he was honest ."
201494,sw3140,sd,"S , social changes ,"
64720,sw3443,sd,But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time .
38654,sw3496,sd,"now I 'm just about , oh , a half hour , uh , north of Salt Lake ."
7075,sw3019,sd,and that 's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw .
130806,sw3340,sd,"and they would n't have to pay him ,"
89336,sw4728,sd,but it blew a head gasket .
102384,sw3232,sd,I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock --
187852,sw4353,sd,-- and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe .
72523,sw2295,sd,"but she 's still on her own , I mean ."
35779,sw2679,sd,"It was real nice ,"
156252,sw2932,sd,"I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which is the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath ."
67489,sw2260,sd,"I guess , before I even met her ."
205971,sw3108,sd,"but , uh , I missed that one ."
198214,sw3083,sd,"but , uh , this , this was actually inner city --"
12718,sw3815,sd,"I wanted s- , uh , stick shift . And , so I did n't have a whole lot of choice ."
177917,sw2658,sd,"And we went in ,"
43234,sw2767,sd,but that 's the minority .
39831,sw3250,sd,"As I said , I , I subscribe to , uh , to PEOPLE and to TIME ,"
126221,sw3191,sd,"and she has to be cared for , whatever , she would prefer , and she 's actually said this , to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment , uh , probably with like a living space and a bedroom --"
140947,sw2178,sd,They 're eight and ten .
141659,sw2393,sd,"and we had a small , um , farm house out in Castroville which is just , uh , to the west of San Antonio --"
71201,sw2041,sd,"I also , um , like to participate in , uh , things like ,"
88607,sw2336,sd,"-- and it 's uh , it 's everything it 's supposed to be ."
130552,sw3371,sd,"Well , my husband would n't do that anyway ."
192881,sw3435,sd,and he drags me out every now and then
190767,sw3658,sd,"Uh , through my company ,"
227,sw3530,sd,"and then , uh , the new author that came out with , uh , oh , the one that , uh , Harrison Ford starred in ."
61023,sw2423,sd,We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers .
124547,sw2963,sd,My family is from Kentucky .
211498,sw3252,sd,I did n't know that .
173363,sw3354,sd,so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants --
35184,sw2993,sd,"so I finally said , we , I want a really solid car ."
180832,sw2667,sd,"and , and , uh , that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that ."
83082,sw2703,sd,"Well , I mean he 's doing all right , probably ."
121510,sw2027,sd,"These were like pretty short , black ,"
213800,sw3134,sd,"Well we 've got , uh , you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids"
158494,sw2608,sd,Because it 's small like that
19201,sw2543,sd,"So he plays that and , and a little bit of piano"
140640,sw2690,sd,"Because , um , I work so hard over the weekend , doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday ."
119808,sw2283,sd,"but I do n't know what , whether they 'd have creosote would do anything ,"
209356,sw3327,sd,"act- , th- , actually that was just a , at , at the beginning of September"
87387,sw3130,sd,"What , what makes me sick is , is when they show the dump sites --"
198347,sw3962,sd,"and , uh , they do their , they do a lot of original recordings themselves ."
160251,sw2427,sd,"and , you know , various other things ,"
72586,sw3691,sd,"Uh , my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old ,"
200554,sw4079,sd,but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill
141280,sw2221,sd,"not that I know of ,"
35921,sw2689,sd,and I ca n't say that there 's too much of that there .
207549,sw3838,sd,"I have one of them . Um ,"
87259,sw3130,sd,and they 're fixing to go to Disneyland .
161641,sw3004,sd,"but it never happened ,"
54926,sw2175,sd,"Like my roommate 's laughing at , you know , at me , you know , because their schooling 's paid for ."
192825,sw2109,sd,Well he at least saw it one time .
83509,sw2672,sd,"I do n't know how , how soon they 're going to do it , or how organized it 's going to be ,"
115543,sw2085,sd,"You know , I , I 'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor --"
26117,sw2967,sd,"That he had stopped writing and had stopped , you know ,"
52702,sw2339,sd,On top of the recreational vehicles .
106406,sw3675,sd,"Uh , we 've , we 're right now where if we do n't buy anything extra , we can make it on what my wife makes ."
79998,sw2015,sd,"I do ,"
209522,sw2305,sd,"Well , I kn , I know , I 'm going to school right now ,"
209841,sw3862,sd,"some , some of the , uh , the people that are in there are real , you know , very nice and friendly to everybody --"
30578,sw2982,sd,And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your --
25404,sw2495,sd,"and we had a , a wooden ,"
10127,sw2768,sd,"It started out just being a terrible place for the people ,"
169175,sw2316,sd,and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school
51681,sw3025,sd,"I , I tend to , uh , I get teased by my family a lot , because , uh , I like experimenting on , on food"
157846,sw2442,sd,So she could find out if she wanted to go .
202649,sw3219,sd,"Well , my husband has to take the bus into Dallas , and does n't return all day ,"
46206,sw3104,sd,they just expected to go .
154260,sw3776,sd,"and the , uh , teacher becomes a , uh , a sort of a consultant , resource person --"
136713,sw3431,sd,"In fact , I was just reading an article ,"
200633,sw3306,sd,Inboard outboard .
37302,sw2562,sd,we have one ugly pine tree .
150632,sw2078,sd,"Me , too , because we go all the time ,"
103003,sw4660,sd,"Oh , well that has n't happened to me yet ."
97455,sw3503,sd,"And , uh , he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy"
153703,sw2005,sd,"I was personally acquainted with the , uh , people who , uh , ran the nursing home in our little hometown ."
113491,sw2969,sd,"But they call them flags up here or down here , down here ."
133322,sw2387,sd,My husband likes Sandy Patty songs .
130658,sw2751,sd,"Because you ca n't see a car ahead of you ,"
196490,sw4103,sd,so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction --
203990,sw3495,sd,"We had a lot of bank robberies and different , lot of break ins and stuff ."
210572,sw3138,sd,but I like it .
214356,sw3887,sd,It was pretty clear here .
201243,sw4074,sd,and I was working
7550,sw3921,sd,"but , uh , South Dakota did n't really have much for ,"
177219,sw3168,sd,"like train tr- , train wrecks and things like that , that"
137410,sw3591,sd,"-- and they did not know how to take care of that ,"
103558,sw3666,sd,and I left the whole thing
135032,sw3105,sd,"Well , even when someone has been convicted"
160404,sw2427,sd,"and , and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better ."
141114,sw2221,sd,"I mean , they 're not allowed to accept any new inmates ."
8986,sw2354,sd,and they drilled this well
106588,sw2079,sd,and that helped .
212434,sw3080,sd,"but also , uh , that , that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles ."
16138,sw4758,sd,I 've always liked the NEW YORKER .
187578,sw3135,sd,"-- but , uh , they both went through preschool ."
10904,sw3985,sd,"and that 's what made me happy ,"
214326,sw3887,sd,"and , and , uh , it 's not too bad around here although you see it , you know , more and more in the sky ."
44423,sw2950,sd,"We could use a little more rain ,"
165126,sw3720,sd,"You fit it in with all that , that ."
39080,sw3170,sd,"And , I often will keep tra- , track of what I 've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook --"
86148,sw2479,sd,"so it was n't , you know , she was n't an infant ."
40856,sw3455,sd,"But , uh , there 's been movies out that I 've been wanting to see ."
204304,sw2406,sd,it 's been about five minutes .
46862,sw2552,sd,We would make that sacrifice .
47689,sw3457,sd,"Uh , we made a point to spend a lot of quality time"
58783,sw3310,sd,"and we says , you know , mom , if you , you know , if you get a , you get better , you 've got to have the care , the doctor insisted on it , you know , if you get better that you could come out ."
135818,sw2586,sd,"So , that was kind of funny ."
43493,sw2263,sd,"Well , I 'm in Pennsylvania ."
3445,sw2614,sd,I 'm glad that you 're in the business .
118064,sw2575,sd,I wanted to get out and see some things .
47595,sw2774,sd,"And , um , I have my mother living with us"
184385,sw3073,sd,"but before that , I really , there 's not much time ."
209559,sw2305,sd,And after a year and a half of that I decided I did n't want that either .
5805,sw3228,sd,"The little guy is so cute ,"
167509,sw2615,sd,"I had a similar thing , that I 've worked on cars ever since I was , uh , a kid ."
214391,sw2611,sd,"Uh , but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or , you know , skirts and , uh , pullover sweaters or , uh , you know , little two piece dress suit , suits like ,"
200381,sw4019,sd,"and they apparently , uh ,"
144077,sw2492,sd,and I 'm excited about it .
191849,sw4327,sd,and that 's it .
172983,sw2525,sd,"at , at the T I there , I said is there any area I should avoid ."
131555,sw3003,sd,"but , uh , you know , it 's , it 's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it , you know ,"
187180,sw3876,sd,"and then when they come out with the new things , you are like , well why did n't you think of that before ."
204554,sw3174,sd,-- and I do n't know how many others are doing that
159505,sw2466,sd,"I 'm , I 'm a single mom ,"
55904,sw2983,sd,As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I 'd be interested in golf .
87773,sw3565,sd,It was n't a one dayer .
203385,sw2837,sd,"and , uh , we bought , uh , this house about , uh , I do n't know , year and a half ago ."
77050,sw2734,sd,"just recently this , uh , black man served nine years was it ,"
4404,sw2168,sd,and I teach in Dallas .
174838,sw3320,sd,"And I never did get a security system ,"
118034,sw2575,sd,"and I got accepted to college ,"
207626,sw3146,sd,It 's Highland Park Village .
134787,sw2875,sd,they were standard Cadillacs
49982,sw2862,sd,"he said , he said the other night on the news that he had n't done any extra shooting for six weeks ,"
132377,sw2663,sd,"You know , like what he said is , you know , a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about , you know , people asking why are you doing this , why are you doing that ."
118142,sw2575,sd,"and they would buy a plot of land , and contractors and builders ,"
79276,sw3342,sd,but I do n't .
90573,sw2366,sd,"you know , I 'm kind of like you , maybe one of these days I 'll get around to it ,"
12158,sw2827,sd,"That 's MUMBLEx , that 's , that 's , that 's a fun idea I mean if you ever , uh , want something different to try ."
173122,sw3417,sd,"it 's a tax on the first dollar earnings ,"
176808,sw2998,sd,"And the , the transportation situation is such that , uh , all the car pollution is , is absolutely awful ."
5239,sw3439,sd,"they give you , they assign you a topic ,"
89746,sw3081,sd,Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain --
133273,sw2387,sd,I think it was done by maybe the Platters or something .
39842,sw3250,sd,I enjoy that .
72613,sw3691,sd,Knocked that parakeet right out of the air .
104727,sw3373,sd,I like her .
65321,sw2533,sd,and she 's thin
24292,sw2471,sd,"I know that it 's not settled but , there are other areas that we could focus our attention on ."
37281,sw2562,sd,"my kids , when they were little they had given me some azaleas --"
196171,sw2775,sd,The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half .
164891,sw3727,sd,"Well , she is into a little bit of everything ."
183773,sw4380,sd,"Then in high school it changed into four levels of , uh , of instruction in the major subjects ."
111576,sw3097,sd,I said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me
49227,sw2228,sd,"and then the price of oil had , had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky ,"
123605,sw3092,sd,"and that 's one of the areas that she is working on . To have , uh , uh , a day care center for the indiv- , the children of the , of the nurses that are staffing the facility ."

41584,sw2942,sd,"Uh , being an engineer now , I believe in it even more strongly than I did before ."
172988,sw2525,sd,And he said is there any place you would n't go by yourself .
42175,sw3716,sd,and people really like my lasagna --
27244,sw3271,sd,We had a cat MUMBLEx that had kittens .
34567,sw3647,sd,"and in my previous job , I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work , uh , nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours --"
177021,sw4886,sd,We just did n't do any of the sheetrock wall work
162828,sw2921,sd,"-- um , it 's really nice ."
176191,sw4697,sd,"-- so . Uh , I was wondering too , if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases --"
186686,sw3351,sd,"I , when I was single --"
35776,sw2679,sd,it was boneless --
172071,sw3325,sd,-- somebody 's trying to cut in on my line
205621,sw4908,sd,"they , they do that on the truck ."
21501,sw2929,sd,"I know where my son works they have , uh , an option right now where they can have their own physician"
145573,sw3699,sd,"And , um , but ours is about ,"
107175,sw3473,sd,"and if you do it ,"
40010,sw2511,sd,"Well , I felt , um , I feel like I could myself , do some things but , that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home , and my husband , that 's willing to do it , I go ahead and let them do it ."
18462,sw4814,sd,I 'm not kidding .
152725,sw3393,sd,"And , uh , then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping , just pouring down , you know ."
125180,sw2019,sd,and she was the one that was intimidated then .
48794,sw2149,sd,"it 's not a lot ,"
83756,sw4698,sd,"Uh , I rented an I B M Selectric ."
58181,sw2340,sd,"I never thought about that , you know ."
45171,sw2578,sd,"I read that half where she was in her later years ,"
2655,sw2289,sd,"uh , it really is ."
63917,sw2177,sd,And there were a couple others that I just have n't had the time .
107900,sw3196,sd,So we were paying like twice .
40083,sw3280,sd,I 'll go through and read it .
211251,sw3821,sd,"You know , and if you 've got , if you 've got a pretty good --"
213127,sw2772,sd,"and there 's a flash flood watch and ,"
127473,sw2726,sd,but now I could not move back home .
80975,sw2229,sd,"well , I guess I 've been kind of off and on"
52125,sw3709,sd,"Uh , I have been thinking of changing , uh ,"
36717,sw3061,sd,"but we do have a dog ,"
64001,sw4363,sd,I kind of like college actually .
141724,sw2393,sd,"and ,"
134731,sw2875,sd,"I , I 've had friends who had them ,"
127840,sw4927,sd,"And that 's the ,"
9013,sw3956,sd,"No benefits , you know . Um ."
78042,sw2609,sd,"I ha- , feel that it 's a problem also ,"
200135,sw2729,sd,"he 's , he 's just about a year old himself and never had really ,"
34510,sw3647,sd,I 'm a nurse
196058,sw2775,sd,It 's rained MUMBLEx .
115560,sw2085,sd,"Well , they , they really ca n't fire you without cause ,"
150754,sw3207,sd,"or , um , like we , I mean we 've had those discussions , you know , about should we put her in or because she 's pretty senile"
23870,sw3769,sd,So we have quite a bit between us and there .
187121,sw3876,sd,-- and then you take it back to the store
118994,sw2537,sd,"and you take their leftover medicine ,"
197372,sw3467,sd,"Wednesdays I , I go to church choir ,"
166818,sw2866,sd,"and , um , the closer you get to Washingt- , D C the more expensive it is ."
101216,sw2073,sd,"and so it 's , uh , quite the opposite ,"
210307,sw2370,sd,and I miss that .
97890,sw2362,sd,She 's only nine months old .
46296,sw3104,sd,"I , they say , you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking ."
100433,sw2264,sd,"Because I finally asked because , you know , we had all of those milk cartons"
5644,sw2944,sd,"um , this is very frightening in that , uh , oh ,"
182445,sw4682,sd,And she told me
196182,sw2775,sd,"and ,"
30531,sw2982,sd,"Well , the one John works for seems to have a l- , you know , good benefits ,"
132139,sw2185,sd,"We painted every room in this house , some of them like two , three times ."
210329,sw3304,sd,My husband is into cycling .
197276,sw3467,sd,that 's the only one I 've got now for this area .
150650,sw2078,sd,I did n't think it was too long at all .
84967,sw3069,sd,it just takes a very long time
105906,sw2616,sd,Well there 's still a lot of dollar five places here
206174,sw3411,sd,"but , uh ,"
41622,sw2942,sd,"So they do force them ,"
72288,sw2840,sd,"I mean , we 're alerted to what the moment we see something ."
30022,sw2524,sd,"I , I did n't have a lot of ,"
79029,sw2835,sd,"they were just getting out with the , you know , the disks and all that , getting away with the cards ,"
49901,sw2862,sd,"I think he only had like eightch- , eight points --"
101080,sw3364,sd,"Well , MURDER , SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that ,"
119563,sw2797,sd,"my children had a , uh , real culture shock , uh , when we lived in Plano ,"
142468,sw4050,sd,"Just like this town is too small for me ,"
58710,sw3310,sd,"when I started out with my mother-in-law , because she was in there first , I --"
102999,sw4660,sd,I had a friend who was in this
173683,sw3809,sd,"You know , as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers ."
213276,sw3142,sd,"We , I guess we , we use the coupons , too ."
22255,sw2960,sd,We have got a lot of those .
141843,sw2393,sd,"and it goes into the full gamut of gardening . You know , everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to , uh , how to prune ."
51355,sw2610,sd,"the way engineering people do is they ,"
166377,sw2860,sd,"So , in order to have a reason for being there , especially as they got older , I became involved in it too"
138835,sw2086,sd,it was really funny .
90545,sw2366,sd,"and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really ca n't quite understand what is that other people take for granted ,"
102648,sw2102,sd,I 'm certainly acquainted with the character --
144541,sw3082,sd,"-- and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant ,"
96668,sw2299,sd,"I mean , I know I need to do more ."
53163,sw2934,sd,And a whole roof of a restaurant came off .
198864,sw4090,sd,but that works out nice because we get paid every week
4813,sw2711,sd,you set your brake .
17890,sw3282,sd,"I guess that 's what I , I hope for them ."
113830,sw2847,sd,"I knew ,"
212108,sw2107,sd,and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date
121961,sw2181,sd,"Well , I guess it was a , uh , a very successful movie financially ,"
203158,sw3120,sd,"Uh , it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students ."
205968,sw3108,sd,"We 've been waiting for a , a good movie out this summer for the kids to see ."
161566,sw3004,sd,and things were n't okay .
108949,sw2893,sd,"I live right near White Rock Lake ,"
39359,sw2693,sd,"Now we would n't have that problem , because we 're not vegetarians ."
59058,sw3489,sd,"you can put , put out certain types of plastic material"
76520,sw2365,sd,"we went to , I 've forgotten , one of the paint stores"
39953,sw2511,sd,"and , you know , I 've , I 've in the past I 've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I 'd find something drastically wrong with it ,"
32453,sw2884,sd,But she does her nails .
133276,sw2387,sd,and she laughed
121206,sw2187,sd,"right in the , in the lukewarm milk ."
9652,sw3903,sd,and it 's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to . Like you mentioned
95689,sw2819,sd,"I mean , here in Dallas everything is just real rush , rush ."
172339,sw2139,sd,"and the phone ringing bothers me ,"
73239,sw3750,sd,And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment --
81330,sw2836,sd,"course in our particular state , uh , we have the prison overcrowding , whatever ,"
112405,sw3011,sd,but it 's just two stories .
63521,sw3051,sd,And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know .
161980,sw3533,sd,"So I really , we 've lost , you know ,"
157322,sw2407,sd,"But , uh , still I , I questioned the ability of some of the teachers to , uh , really do a bang-up job ,"
162075,sw3533,sd,"the question now to ask , is it difficult to find time ,"
113436,sw2969,sd,Green spiky leaves .
77588,sw4733,sd,"and we just ,"
100318,sw2397,sd,And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all .
140125,sw2570,sd,"Well , this machine does it all in one step ."
149085,sw3983,sd,-- so we 're kind of running the gamut .
63303,sw2545,sd,"she 's not going to do it ,"
118886,sw2537,sd,"Um , as far as the new hires , I , I hired on just early enough that I , I missed it . Um , where the new hires were concerned"
65604,sw2010,sd,I do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go
150788,sw3207,sd,"She says that when her husband died that he said , oh , that my uncle had said that he would never ha- , put her in a rest home ."
198977,sw2539,sd,"Um , last , like a few summers ago I kept two children every day for the entire summer"
130824,sw3340,sd,"he 's been in the paper , in jail ,"
160053,sw2427,sd,"The first one , they started them indoors this time ."
186006,sw2945,sd,"but , uh ,"
211273,sw3821,sd,"and I 've got , you know ,"
95428,sw2785,sd,"and , uh , she would do that if , if we did n't tell her that she 'd better not ."
69048,sw3377,sd,and the reason I like it so much is because I 'm essentially playing against myself .
60082,sw2418,sd,"I , I do n't want to , I want to chew up the whole line here ."
6827,sw3253,sd,"and to me , I like that , I guess , too , although there are people ,"
130619,sw2751,sd,"Cheap taste , cheap taste in cars , okay ."
204013,sw3495,sd,"So and I 'm in my twenties ,"
81435,sw2836,sd,Course it does n't always work out in their favor .
56199,sw3185,sd,-- so I 'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather .
116000,sw2620,sd,I know that .
181008,sw2667,sd,"and it 's , it 's a pretty nice setup . Um ,"
76621,sw2365,sd,"and the blue , even so many years , two years later or so it does n't match ,"
109851,sw2300,sd,"I got taken on some fire- , on firewood ."
189436,sw2395,sd,and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions .
119551,sw2797,sd,"and ,"
80345,sw2461,sd,"we 're going to talk about the public school system ,"
69168,sw2617,sd,what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it
107171,sw3473,sd,"I , I travel quite a bit in my --"
163870,sw2653,sd,"so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated ,"
92625,sw2676,sd,"it 's just a strange landscape ,"
94971,sw2435,sd,"But we take her to just about every movie ,"
15961,sw2953,sd,"Of course , I do not have much to compare it to ."
197482,sw3467,sd,"and then , in the paper said it"
3199,sw2125,sd,it really is .
189527,sw2395,sd,"-- and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck ,"
161090,sw3451,sd,I 'm not that familiar .
197120,sw4877,sd,We do n't have any grandchildren yet .
144500,sw3082,sd,"this is one that 's , uh , the Baker family reunion --"
194900,sw4129,sd,in certain crimes .
21766,sw2437,sd,You know --
78935,sw3450,sd,that 's the way I am .
138053,sw2248,sd,and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable .
164375,sw3173,sd,but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra .
126168,sw3191,sd,"and she lives with my aunt and uncle ,"
183092,sw4358,sd,"Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that , uh , trash , uh , the telephone books are the type of thing that do n't break down over a long period of time ."
14849,sw2342,sd,"and it talks about how , you know , if we could just all get toge- , you know ,"
54417,sw2879,sd,"and now , they ca n't find them"
62658,sw2499,sd,Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed .
101787,sw3254,sd,-- so I really do n't like the drive-thrus that much .
159448,sw2035,sd,"it 's like five dollars admission per child , all day ."
162350,sw2915,sd,"Now it 's even , it 's even higher in Dallas County ,"
108720,sw2515,sd,"but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then ,"
211125,sw3821,sd,"And , uh , and I always pay them off totally every month ."
131228,sw3018,sd,"I have , I put some , put in some , uh , an antenna , a really good antenna"
47571,sw2774,sd,"and , and , uh , he was , it was fun to work with him ."
22924,sw2621,sd,"But if I had to pick one , I would probably pick Sam Huff , as a matter of fact ."
13759,sw2368,sd,but some family things changed
125331,sw2631,sd,"and yeah , and my nephew is two , almost two ,"
92169,sw2566,sd,"and that 's something I like , too ,"
88322,sw4859,sd,"I , I 've , I enjoy ,"
162934,sw2921,sd,and we moved once a year usually .
64992,sw3406,sd,"It 's a very clean , uh , fire extinguisher ,"
83306,sw2703,sd,"And , you know , and then to go into Baltimore , I mean , it well , it 's fewer miles ,"
104220,sw4056,sd,"They cover , uh , just about everything , vision , dental , medical --"
90709,sw4548,sd,"and , uh , I 've also never been a victim although I have some , I have two friends whose wives were murdered"
198443,sw2061,sd,"Oh , one of my instructors , uh , said that they were doing something like this"
62450,sw2051,sd,that 's something I do
145389,sw2641,sd,"we live , also live in the city now , actually in Manhattan ."
29287,sw2292,sd,"that 's , that 's one of , I think , the hard things right now ,"
32338,sw2884,sd,"And , um , we also , we , um , we have a , a U S Air and Visa card ."
103810,sw3408,sd,and there 's one T A for the whole class .
81732,sw2434,sd,and it took us all of twelve hours .
74050,sw2502,sd,"Well , I know that Russia , they 're , they 're comparably more , better educated than we are ,"
99410,sw3850,sd,"I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot ,"
179407,sw2568,sd,Paul Hogan .
204333,sw2093,sd,"um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting ."
120844,sw4726,sd,"Uh , I , I know my friend is , uh , really into guns"
112513,sw3011,sd,Virginia .
172855,sw2525,sd,"and , uh ,"
45167,sw2578,sd,"And , um ,"
171508,sw2439,sd,"And they had already told me , We located one at Town North ."
195758,sw3144,sd,"finally , it 's my first summer movie ."
37174,sw2562,sd,"well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it ,"
157922,sw2241,sd,"ac- , actually it 's done , uh ,"
89848,sw2756,sd,"Uh , I live down in the south western part of Blacksburg ."
131596,sw3003,sd,and you can haul things
192636,sw4168,sd,I think I 've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE .
31627,sw3293,sd,and we went up to the --
13894,sw2368,sd,"pretty much ,"
184035,sw4319,sd,"We 've got stock purchase program and a ,"
164031,sw2691,sd,"Well our daughter and son-in-law moved up , back up here . He 's from Texas , but course she 's from here , uh , about a year and a half ago ,"
4869,sw2711,sd,the river walk .
17267,sw2191,sd,And I would n't enjoy it .
166821,sw2866,sd,"Washington , it really is a , uh , uh , an international city , where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore ."
7475,sw3921,sd,"Most of the time , uh , if we catch something , we 'll take it home and eat it ."
197161,sw4877,sd,"And , uh , the baby just screams ."
16015,sw3657,sd,"but , uh , as you know P C -s change quite rapidly"
137476,sw2585,sd,"Cambodians , uh , Asians , Vietnamese ."
2063,sw2788,sd,"um , it 's just not in the cards for me right now"
136343,sw2652,sd,"but it 's like , uh , I just do n't want to do it ,"
107658,sw2992,sd,"Well , I noticed that , my kids are , uh , older now ,"
94093,sw2877,sd,"they do n't ,"
707,sw2741,sd,"You know , is n't that funny , uh , because the same thing happened to us , except I was twelve ."
128681,sw2622,sd,"but , it , it keeps us supported temporarily ,"
37298,sw2562,sd,Oh --
208755,sw3801,sd,"There was no one there ,"
178746,sw3550,sd,"-- so it depends on your destination , too ."
113617,sw2847,sd,"and right now I 'm reading , um , Judith Viorst 's book called NECESSARY LOSSES , where she talks about different losses that we 've had in our lives that we have to get past if we 're going to mature and --"
7076,sw3019,sd,"And I just , I do not like it ."
70054,sw2486,sd,"They were pretty much in good taste ,"
69915,sw3539,sd,"and I have done that before , but it has always had to be late at night --"
80830,sw2121,sd,"I , I read that recently somewhere ,"
137328,sw3543,sd,"A six person jury could have decided either way , of course ."
138577,sw4940,sd,so I know what you 're talking about .
109065,sw2893,sd,"I was telling a friend of mine that I 'd be almo- , almost as bad as being an alcoholic ,"
117062,sw2105,sd,"but there , there 's no hold outs ."
106445,sw3675,sd,"But , the homeowner ca n't be touched ."
18268,sw4788,sd,"It would be more a tarp , uh --"
79611,sw2130,sd,"because I used to live in , uh , Massachusetts ,"
200809,sw3441,sd,but I just do n't like those nine hundred numbers .
54075,sw2780,sd,"at one time I just sat here and thought , well , how can anybody believe that"
154476,sw2603,sd,so I 'm very limited what I do .
201892,sw4765,sd,"You know , they , they support drug habits with , uh , with , uh , you know , with things like , uh , you know , burglary or , or prostitution or stuff like that ,"
168407,sw2826,sd,In Allendale .
190906,sw4036,sd,and I just assumed that it would have been .
127918,sw4927,sd,I found about it on the network .
59901,sw2418,sd,"That 's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good , oh , long-range planning budget mode ."
132040,sw2984,sd,"and it , uh ,"
191526,sw3445,sd,"so we , we often sit around and say , what movies should we rent ?"
121449,sw2027,sd,I kind of try to judge from day to day .
101627,sw3526,sd,"Uh , work ,"
154685,sw3345,sd,but I 'm always aware of what 's going on like that --
35220,sw2993,sd,That 's the one drawback .
45254,sw2578,sd,"And then , um , whether , you know , they 're a foreign author or whatever , um , or if it 's their style or , or just understanding the material ."
52660,sw3361,sd,"And by the same token , my wife 's mother is now moved into a nursing home ,"
53050,sw2934,sd,"Um , well , uh , Richardson 's a suburb of Dallas ."
9232,sw2871,sd,on that order .
48291,sw3735,sd,"but , it 's a knitting one ."
105335,sw3012,sd,well it 's just a very basic life
109701,sw2300,sd,"Thing about the credit union is , it 's , the way it 's set up is if you have two thousand dollars left , let 's say , on , on the loan ."
133206,sw2387,sd,"but it 's the po- , the music I enjoy the most ."
203273,sw3120,sd,"and when you mentioned that , we , we have friends who have children there who just love it ."

150762,sw3207,sd,"His grandmother too and they 're , that hi- , her son , his uncle , whatever , you know , anyway ."
164233,sw2436,sd,"or there was some other ,"

55711,sw2983,sd,I do n't either .
149383,sw3343,sd,and they did n't work --

159618,sw2466,sd,"His latest book , and I ca n't recall the name of it , is just excellent ,"
194761,sw3154,sd,"and then , uh , who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into ,"
103206,sw2197,sd,"and so we 've got a lot of , uh , M I T graduates that are in there"
86389,sw2479,sd,it was ridiculous .
199561,sw2628,sd,whenever I was coming up and everything
214484,sw2611,sd,"areas , the smoking area , you know , it 's closed in ,"
77373,sw3074,sd,"and ,"
39614,sw2935,sd,"So I do admire that , but I have n't really put , uh , too much energy into it ."
19286,sw3774,sd,"Well , we 've been real lucky that ,"
202874,sw2429,sd,"but they had live crawfish ,"
136641,sw3431,sd,"and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth ,"

83576,sw2672,sd,But I did n't realize that our garbage is n't being decomposed .
27326,sw3271,sd,my husband 's grandparents have a dog
177972,sw2658,sd,"and they 're , they were doing it at their own costs ."
15069,sw2709,sd,and I know that .
100777,sw2832,sd,"he says , looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there ."
88554,sw2039,sd,"Well , for example . In Greek there are seven different words for love ."
99623,sw2226,sd,"but then on the other extreme I like to read , uh , uh , I guess ho , I do n't know , horror , Steven King type books ."
47823,sw3118,sd,"That 's , that 's just it ."
182713,sw3420,sd,"but that , you know , we have been thinking about that ,"
24842,sw2623,sd,"I 've , uh , you know , I 've helped out extremely , uh ,"
28052,sw3665,sd,"But , uh , and then there 's a new sitcom on that is , Tim Allen 's , uh , what is it , uh , HANDYMAN ."
107232,sw3473,sd,"I do three hundred sit ups a day now , but not at that , in the morning ,"
162166,sw2897,sd,"But , um , otherwise , I 'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here ."
70560,sw2460,sd,it 's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games .
84003,sw2465,sd,"we , we build , uh , laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also ."
166613,sw2860,sd,"and I mean , the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aids and an eraser and things ,"
64587,sw3443,sd,I just receive them .
199858,sw2399,sd,"Well , I found --"
161647,sw3004,sd,and it worked out well .
186819,sw4626,sd,and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do .
63091,sw2545,sd,"when this subject was mentioned to us I said , well ,"
184039,sw4319,sd,"but , uh , there 's a four O one K plan --"
193449,sw4356,sd,"Saturns , you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to a , a Saturn dealer ."
196900,sw4096,sd,And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama
6347,sw2308,sd,"Um , the one my grandmother 's in is very , um , hospital like ."
88699,sw2336,sd,"But those are my criteria ,"
8482,sw2528,sd,"the first ones I saw they had , um , a man on who was , uh , he played college football and almost went pro ,"
176364,sw4314,sd,it 's a lot of fun .
5504,sw2944,sd,"Um , I , I have very mixed feelings about it ."
163594,sw2909,sd,"So , --"
36056,sw3686,sd,"and it never did , never did run right again ."
62338,sw2051,sd,"I mean , I was watching a thing last night , up in Washington State ."
169510,sw3238,sd,"and mine are two and nine months ,"
29612,sw2854,sd,"or if they do n't have that , uh ,"
88740,sw2336,sd,"And then you saw , uh , hundred thousand dollar cars ,"
165341,sw3296,sd,They 're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on this .
101608,sw3526,sd,just a couple .
94689,sw2485,sd,"Ask them what they have ,"
39819,sw3250,sd,"You know , they get tons of magazines it seems --"
153810,sw2005,sd,"And , uh , fortunately , we agreed , you know , on exactly , you know , what we thought should be done ."
60217,sw2773,sd,"we 're , I happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students"
23187,sw2959,sd,"And while he was there , he caught some kind of a strange disease ."
195023,sw4181,sd,"we pay five percent sales tax ,"
141018,sw2178,sd,"and I thought , oh , my ."
71588,sw2220,sd,I like the group .
87489,sw3130,sd,my sister was here recently from Connecticut
61365,sw2279,sd,Different places every year .
123297,sw2482,sd,I would love to live up there .
139356,sw2630,sd,-- and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having --
175105,sw2970,sd,"but it 's , that 's just what it is ."
82453,sw2131,sd,"I do n't know what that is ,"
91854,sw3148,sd,so that 's not going to work . At least not now .
190142,sw4166,sd,"My in- , families was up in Maryland --"
74778,sw2445,sd,and it started raining really heavy
16411,sw3136,sd,but we do have some blackberry bushes .
69549,sw3569,sd,"so I , I , I 'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking , and , and so forth ."
144006,sw2492,sd,and we 've had to get out and treat our lawn for that .
57250,sw2237,sd,"I 'm no help on that , then . Because ,"
188243,sw2184,sd,"I , like I say , I 'm a former drug user ,"
79108,sw2835,sd,"and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a , a phone number to respond to"
170217,sw3655,sd,"like I said , I did n't notice it till then ."
155475,sw2488,sd,and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in South Dallas
105750,sw2616,sd,"the thing , the thing that , that , that I saw was okay ,"
202630,sw3219,sd,but I do n't think there 's an escape from light jackets .
182760,sw2761,sd,"and then , you know , arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know , um , food and who 's , who 's staying where , because a lot of people fro- , are from down here , in Texas ."
158428,sw2608,sd,"And , uh , usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up ,"
89369,sw4728,sd,people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves .
20115,sw2478,sd,"And , I always wondered how they can play the money either way they want , you know ."
124571,sw2963,sd,"So , uh , it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date , you know --"
106986,sw3072,sd,but it ended up being kind of nice because you 're not accountable to anyone .
21861,sw2437,sd,so I get cash .
45714,sw4615,sd,exactly .
130256,sw3036,sd,That 's certainly where her roots are .
204035,sw3495,sd,they 're not nearly as selective as they used to be .
43826,sw2995,sd,"Like the Census Bureau , United States Census Bureau ."
62465,sw2051,sd,"or what 's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired ."
190276,sw4341,sd,"and I 'm kind of i- , in favor of capital punishment also ."
203195,sw3120,sd,"And , uh , you know , having gone to the University of Minnesota , I know what a big university is like ."
163184,sw2874,sd,down here it 's like two hundred dollars a day .
140095,sw2570,sd,"And when we broke things off ,"
146036,sw2253,sd,Iowa and Nebraska .
204862,sw3171,sd,"but , uh , yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better ."
95378,sw2785,sd,"our favorite is something called white half runner green beans ,"
194544,sw4619,sd,"We , uh , she goes more often than I ."
103632,sw3666,sd,I know it .
188956,sw4177,sd,"uh , they , they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence ,"
168580,sw2826,sd,"one is now a senior in high school and the other 's in college ,"
165192,sw3296,sd,but I do n't have one at home .
55313,sw4716,sd,"-- and th- , it was your father 's"
120890,sw4726,sd,"I 'm not really sure but , what uh , th- , the gun laws in P- , Pennsylvania are like ."
75330,sw2870,sd,it depends on what issue you 're talking about .
178517,sw2547,sd,"I mean , the , the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population ."
163727,sw2653,sd,"Years ago T I sent me to their , uh , computer school down in Austin ."
205330,sw3476,sd,"I mean , I think my children learned the metric system ,"
153744,sw2005,sd,"I mean , she tr- , she had , she had children all across the United States --"
159977,sw2427,sd,and one 's like fifteen by four .
214069,sw3188,sd,"and , and then I 'd have probably rolled it on ."
133563,sw2755,sd,Their employees earn almost nothing .
156364,sw2932,sd,"I mean I could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me ,"
51302,sw2576,sd,"but in the Summer , like right now , my mom , well , like she does n't let us watch T V until like eight o'clock at night , you know ,"
25083,sw2889,sd,"I do n't play it that much any more ,"
190656,sw2593,sd,"Just when I get some spare time here and there I 'll work on it ,"
153590,sw2669,sd,"and the other thing , too , is , you know , between here and El Paso 's , what , five hundred miles ,"
161114,sw3451,sd,and I noticed I was spending less and less time with them
56074,sw4745,sd,and I work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where I do n't have I do n't have the family time .
146176,sw2253,sd,"I mean the book is , is chilling ."
184595,sw4346,sd,and the city had a very low tax base so they did n't have a lot --
18360,sw4037,sd,"and I , uh , --"
118521,sw2766,sd,"And I think gosh , do I want him to go"
169094,sw2316,sd,I 'm wondering with the boom down here .
140500,sw2690,sd,"Um , I do n't like the politics surrounding the program though ,"
39558,sw2935,sd,But that 's nice to have
135498,sw2586,sd,"And we go , and we fish ,"
119729,sw2283,sd,"-- you know , we eat it , we ,"
10556,sw3754,sd,Went to Alcatraz .
16272,sw3059,sd,"or , as I say , th- , I prefer the light movies that , uh ,"
97990,sw2362,sd,"and if we did have a , a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there ."
23974,sw3769,sd,"and they were really good ,"
208904,sw3508,sd,we used --
151424,sw3047,sd,After my master 's .
127975,sw3556,sd,"You know , I 've , I 've just never spent any time watching it"
148692,sw3236,sd,"Well , the boys think it 's fun , plus you get your exercise"
161915,sw2820,sd,"but I had n't had to sit down and , and well , what do I think about it ."
199692,sw4123,sd,"and that 's one of the reasons where I , why I try and get as many sources as possible ,"
142002,sw3002,sd,"like I say , by the time I read the newspaper it 's the , the it 's that morning 's news from the day before"
156610,sw4064,sd,I was thinking primarily criminal cases .
69375,sw3229,sd,"Um , if it was formal I 'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something ."
124974,sw2996,sd,My sister used to live there .
5806,sw3228,sd,and he 's terribly rich by now .
12471,sw2594,sd,"But see , I do n't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway ."
4219,sw3281,sd,it gives a very delicious taste .
140522,sw2690,sd,"Well I 'm one of those rare guys , who , I , I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event , um , if ever watch one ."
42591,sw2839,sd,and I do n't know quite how to do it .
67786,sw3458,sd,"I just , I enjoy it ,"
80015,sw2015,sd,and I really hate that .
112082,sw2989,sd,"And we could , uh , read the things in the history books and understand what they said , when it was like , we need food , we need to raise food quickly --"
83751,sw4698,sd,"And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high ,"
173876,sw3607,sd,"actually , they say that when the house is , uh , fifteen , it 's already old ,"
160979,sw3451,sd,"and I know , uh , one has gone to a , well , two of them have gone to preschool ."
49755,sw3167,sd,I have .
129650,sw2926,sd,"and they did n't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors ,"
91312,sw2540,sd,"I 've also always thought about the idea , you know , most sports , you know , which are the N R A and people have their thing , you know ,"
79805,sw2324,sd,"It may be arrogant ,"
71863,sw2858,sd,"Um , and they , they do a lot of volunteer work"
156007,sw3487,sd,"when I , when I went away to school , I 'm trying to think my criteria ."
64869,sw2782,sd,"An we , um , have been just forced to budget much more because I quit working to be home with the kids ."
165393,sw3296,sd,mostly my one sister uses hers for her children .
102594,sw3279,sd,"I , I believe in paying my share ,"
54344,sw2780,sd,but then um a friend of mine 's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term .
75945,sw2334,sd,"But , uh , I had a coin shop ,"
212481,sw3080,sd,-- I need to get started on that .
106228,sw2806,sd,"And Dan was a drummer ,"
77617,sw4733,sd,"I mean , we do it to a point"
103526,sw3666,sd,but he wo n't pull them .
190679,sw2593,sd,"I , I have seen things I really like ,"
146780,sw3303,sd,"so , course , I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz ,"
46189,sw3104,sd,"but she went to Erie , to Gannan University . Uh , or Gannan College ,"
60898,sw2423,sd,We 'll start them inside
131481,sw3003,sd,a new car payment .
140554,sw2690,sd,"Well , I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans ."
8476,sw2528,sd,"I mean , when I had , uh ,"
34447,sw3463,sd,"Well , I , I know a lot of people ,"
161047,sw3451,sd,there was nothing to it .
133284,sw2387,sd,"I said , Oh no , here we are ."
185945,sw2945,sd,I work for Texas Instruments .
17200,sw2191,sd,"and , uh , he checked body fat content --"
102744,sw2102,sd,So they like that .
203262,sw3120,sd,"I , I mean , I just really could n't look at anything else ."
140745,sw4840,sd,"I mean , a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been , have been , in the past , uh , have been not taxed because there 's been such a large lobby against them , against --"
32734,sw3016,sd,"and , uh , I 'll call later ,"
43815,sw2995,sd,"but , I , uh , I do telemarketing ,"
183942,sw4334,sd,"and very often the artist will have a d- , an album"
73182,sw3639,sd,So the only thing I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in the stereo system
28109,sw3665,sd,"but I just seem to , to miss a lot of these programs ."
195231,sw4378,sd,And I guess we had most of it done
60104,sw2418,sd,"Uh , in my old age I 'm trying to just hang in there until I get my kids through school"
137127,sw2006,sd,"and so , w- , w- , you know , what we do to make contributions so that , basically , we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems , uh , that , uh , scrub out the , N O X and , uh , V O C 's and , and ammonia compounds , uh , like all the acids , to a certain level ."
123619,sw3092,sd,"And it would be just ,"
64328,sw3525,sd,"-- and I , and I guess control my irons , better , you know ,"
39976,sw2511,sd,"Anyway , but the car that the muffler people had , um , my , at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further , you know ,"
94889,sw2435,sd,"well , the last movie I saw , but it was n't my choice , was the NINJA TURTLE movie ."
131633,sw3003,sd,"and she was fine ,"
206144,sw3411,sd,"If , uh , if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed , the e- , the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it does n't come through the , so it does n't go , it does n't go through the , you know , into the inside ."
78557,sw2053,sd,"He likes to help me design , um , you know , projects that are ,"
50556,sw3151,sd,"they do n't have to submit to drug testing like , like they do here in the States and some places abroad ."
65187,sw2533,sd,"I think it 's still the New York Yankees , you know ,"
56692,sw3076,sd,so I have n't kept track of it .
204365,sw2093,sd,but you make it in strips .
67393,sw2260,sd,"I , I saw , that , too ."
55661,sw3518,sd,the guy came after him with that big knife .
68047,sw2032,sd,"It 's like brash metal , which all they do is like , they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar ,"
4779,sw2711,sd,"It was , it was super ,"
198926,sw4090,sd,and like I say we have n't been real consistent with it .
38707,sw2968,sd,"Uh , well , I like all kinds , uh ,"
43511,sw2263,sd,"But , we 've , uh , we 've done , uh , many types of camping ."
194149,sw4379,sd,So they each have their own account .
145496,sw3699,sd,It 's a two story .
144607,sw3082,sd,The people that we have that do n't come are out El Paso way --
152367,sw2171,sd,"it 's interesting we got this topic because I , I , I do n't know what I marked off to get this ,"
26479,sw3013,sd,"And we make real simple things , you know , those , oh ,"
188554,sw3917,sd,"I think it 's , uh , really neat to see and all that educated minority , uh , person --"
52990,sw2934,sd,So it 's not been bad at all .
93500,sw3513,sd,"Well , actually , it 's been warm ,"
109100,sw2893,sd,"but when you get into some of these , some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait ."
28076,sw3665,sd,"And then , uh , it , it 's , it appeared that maybe it probably was n't the neighbor ."
105509,sw3355,sd,and my son will be in next year
187387,sw4152,sd,"she gave her no time in jail , you know , all of these things"
178305,sw3259,sd,It 's real entertaining for her .
52031,sw3709,sd,I do .
51215,sw2576,sd,I would say she was five to eight years old --
127984,sw3556,sd,and I left at halftime --
43220,sw2767,sd,We live in a college town
173288,sw3354,sd,"so any how , occasionally I find them in the flower beds ."
87905,sw3565,sd,"I 've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall ,"
133385,sw2387,sd,"it 's not always classical as , you know , the official , uh , word might go ,"
81964,sw2441,sd,"uh , that 's my other complaint ."
85764,sw4311,sd,"And , uh , I guess my third consideration would be , uh ,"
200115,sw2729,sd,"and she just , you know , thinks it 's great ."
33849,sw2386,sd,"Um , well , they have some watches that look really nice ."
85273,sw3069,sd,"You know , I 'm ,"
58029,sw3414,sd,"So we started collecting them ,"
177058,sw4886,sd,"He , he 'd , we 'd gotten a couple of books"
6492,sw3189,sd,so we kind of met halfway --
155078,sw2584,sd,"I have n't quite adjusted , you know ?"
113711,sw2847,sd,"And a book called JOB CUES , GENDER CUES , which explains , uh , how certain professions and vocations get , uh , flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other ,"
160431,sw2427,sd,"We 've tried it ,"
161191,sw3332,sd,-- but they would take a credit card .
48661,sw2149,sd,"It says something like , if people were to give five ,"
141133,sw2221,sd,"and they are not allowed ,"
5895,sw3228,sd,She 's four --
210355,sw3304,sd,"a , a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed ,"
183296,sw4133,sd,"once you 've made a decision that way , it 's a little difficult to go back on it ."
22950,sw2621,sd,"him and Franco Harris ,"
110899,sw3805,sd,heavy involvement from the public .
77857,sw3988,sd,"I have a , a tape collection that I like to listen to , uh , cassette tapes --"
29766,sw2854,sd,"But I 've been at companies where , uh , you know , the , deci- , the , the trend is , or the definite mood is , well we made conscious decisions not to have children ."
186023,sw2945,sd,"and they have , we have thirteen grand ,"
196518,sw4103,sd,"I do n't know how many people are , uh , getting involved in this"
113784,sw2847,sd,"But , he 's got a , quite a collection of those ."
96052,sw4876,sd,and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work .
150944,sw3313,sd,"A woman was raped in Richardson , I read in the paper oh , about a two weeks ago now ."
65773,sw3768,sd,see as much as --
140414,sw4821,sd,"but that , that 's what it seems like , ten o'clock at night ."
97245,sw2743,sd,"Well without even any question ,"
194129,sw4379,sd,"Uh , we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money . Uh --"
7673,sw3424,sd,"and , uh , but , uh , the cousins are closer to our daughter 's age , and , than to our son 's and just totally different ,"
196120,sw2775,sd,"So , uh ,"
169567,sw3238,sd,"but , I mean , we were going to the doctor once a week ,"
44229,sw3703,sd,and it was terrible .
90491,sw2366,sd,"and so consequently we wind up , wound up playing a lot of classical music there"
93992,sw2877,sd,"Then I did n't notice any improvement till the , after the sixth one ."
100832,sw2832,sd,and the whole thing would be full of water .
116004,sw2620,sd,Well that I would n't know
154658,sw3345,sd,"I read , I read the newspapers sometimes --"
121028,sw2187,sd,"Um , they , they made a couple of those , uh ,"
114328,sw2431,sd,"MUMBLEx more or less alike the , the , uh , Chevrolet"
109247,sw2893,sd,I did n't hurt it too bad .
23208,sw2959,sd,and he was in combat .
89193,sw2599,sd,"but I , I sure am scared of them Giants ."
19934,sw3001,sd,"Then there 's other times that , you know , maybe the prescription would n't cost more than like seven or eight dollars"
6808,sw3253,sd,"I , I feel like I 'm a little bit too , uh , much of a city , city mouse to try doing it ."
116951,sw3096,sd,"I ,"
147386,sw2490,sd,and I forgot about the one in the chamber .
177289,sw3168,sd,"And their program they had , I do n't think had a lot of , uh , problems associated with it ,"
202655,sw3219,sd,"that 's , around here in a lot of places that 's the way it is --"
161491,sw3004,sd,"but yet most of the problems we hear ,"
12038,sw2827,sd,"and , and she 's having ,"
44408,sw2950,sd,"People are , have got their gardens in , a lot of them now ."
59981,sw2418,sd,I do n't know what he 's going to be in Austin .
71647,sw2220,sd,"but I 'm going to school , uh , for legal assistant"
24056,sw3244,sd,"and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that ,"
173321,sw3354,sd,"because I started to say , you can , there 's different times they say it 's okay to do it ."
89953,sw2756,sd,"well , when we came back from the outer banks we came up due Norfork and spent the night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night ."
179465,sw2568,sd,"and they pushed it back , to playing it in the theaters until like August ,"
105135,sw3372,sd,"But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse . Um , mainly the areas whe , where they were doing a lot of , um , manufacturing type things"
138266,sw2248,sd,"and , you know , and then they 'll leave ,"
22132,sw2960,sd,And I will let him watch the T V when I am wanting to get my house work done .
192062,sw2789,sd,"First at eight , I think we had"
20940,sw3102,sd,"I finished with a two five ,"
72135,sw3576,sd,"Man , we get the best strawberries , that you just ca n't believe ."
116539,sw3131,sd,Did n't want to cook .
169422,sw3099,sd,And so we will just have to see how things work out .
149723,sw4812,sd,"And , uh , they , basically , uh , did the same exact thing ."
96861,sw2299,sd,they just get bugs in them .
124312,sw3029,sd,I 'm in favor of it .
24755,sw2623,sd,"And , uh , our youngest is , uh , expecting her first baby ."
195045,sw4181,sd,Taxachusetts
130129,sw2110,sd,I mean it says just keep on until
60437,sw3260,sd,"so we go visit both sets of grandparents and , and take car trips ."
81739,sw2434,sd,"I 'm s- , I should n't probably say control ."
89649,sw3081,sd,I really like it .
46538,sw3064,sd,and I wish I did n't .
83213,sw2703,sd,"But , you know , it 's in the bleachers , way out in the , you know , in center field ,"
66806,sw4659,sd,"Well , uh ,"
184918,sw4364,sd,"And people are looking for alternate ways of , uh ,"
43950,sw2995,sd,"and I s , no ."
91508,sw2285,sd,"There 's a very large , uh , or very high percentage of car theft ."
142265,sw3020,sd,"actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit ,"
11115,sw4721,sd,"but I just , I do n't demand a lot for myself"
39223,sw2693,sd,"My husband has been one for , oh , just over a year now ."
121426,sw2027,sd,and it varies like every day . I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next .
144943,sw2372,sd,If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night .
79015,sw2835,sd,"And , I can very clearly remember ten years ago I was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and , and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful"
29368,sw2292,sd,"and I think that , you know , we 're really satisfied with that choice ,"
181030,sw2667,sd,So they have big variety .
213449,sw4175,sd,I 'm from Atlanta .
63168,sw2545,sd,-- and we have a powerful computer down at work .
49904,sw2862,sd,they thought that was big news .
25565,sw2991,sd,It 'll automatically do that for you .
32145,sw2432,sd,"But you know , like in Minnesota , they 've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles ."
65248,sw2533,sd,and he 's like glued at the T V .
189305,sw3902,sd,I 'm twenty-nine .
114200,sw2431,sd,"but just like me , I always think well , you know , these things must be safe ,"
22249,sw2960,sd,"And like THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER , we have , oh ,"
148634,sw3236,sd,"I think it was originally scheduled for February ,"
58228,sw2340,sd,"But , one , and , and she visited us here in , in Dallas ."
58530,sw2467,sd,Not at all .
184091,sw4319,sd,I also have a part time job at a law firm
13596,sw2368,sd,"it does , considering that , you know , you- , uh , house payments are ,"
13298,sw3500,sd,He better not be mine .
164008,sw2691,sd,Repossessed .
45881,sw2662,sd,"and , and they said it starred , um , Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks ,"
68020,sw2032,sd,"We 're talking about what they , what they call hard rock ."
95071,sw2435,sd,I love those movies .
197762,sw2145,sd,and the children are left without either parent .
135253,sw2661,sd,"and we have a daughter ,"
141335,sw2025,sd,"If it 's life and a day , then he 's not eligible for parole ."
34027,sw2190,sd,"Oh , well , I 'm not an expert ,"
163045,sw2874,sd,"but , uh , uh , they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon --"
212786,sw2018,sd,"and that way we 're not really missing any thing out , you know ,"
195686,sw4320,sd,"And they see all their friends and neighbors , uh ,"
165845,sw3206,sd,It 's about why there are n't more people that are voting and participating in ...
171260,sw2439,sd,-- so we need a car that 's big enough for six .
105517,sw3355,sd,"I , I have totally , totally a tin ear --"
122129,sw2181,sd,"and they failed individually ,"
85598,sw2472,sd,I 'm going to have to think of that .
130088,sw2110,sd,I 'd have to basically say my birth .
195395,sw2546,sd,"and I would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it , it 's not a terrent , a deterrent , because it 's not ."
140951,sw2178,sd,"but no ,"
131657,sw3003,sd,"and it would take a hit fairly well ,"
165053,sw3720,sd,"We really do n't watch , I think , as much T V as a lot of people ."
196115,sw2775,sd,I really do enjoy that .
86086,sw2479,sd,"Well he was in , he was in the same center for two years ,"
109005,sw2893,sd,and there 's other times when I just get tired of it
207978,sw3369,sd,and they showed all five in a row .
54848,sw2175,sd,"So there was always , there was never just one alone , you know ."
88079,sw3115,sd,"And , and I said , well , you know , that was okay ."
178748,sw3550,sd,Kind of strange .
204912,sw3171,sd,because we have a lot of flying with Continental --
101563,sw2710,sd,"And ,"
60433,sw3260,sd,"So , uh , we play that a lot of them ,"
167210,sw2469,sd,"I was trying to think of some while , while it was , uh , talking about it ,"
6318,sw2308,sd,"She had many sisters ,"
43344,sw2767,sd,"I do n't know how , she 's moved away . I do n't know how it is now"
212159,sw3266,sd,I enjoy it a lot .
169086,sw2316,sd,"and they 're mad at the world ,"
54414,sw2879,sd,"and it 's , the , the , the , the , the MUMBLEx cri- , I think that 's the , the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they 're , they 're patrol , the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done , oh , heinous things from calli- , from killing police officers to , I mean just multiple , you know , mo- , molestations to murders of children , just , you know , really bad things"
3481,sw2638,sd,"but the program , you know , was still fairly new ."
37243,sw2562,sd,"like I have , uh , yellow ones ,"
84064,sw2465,sd,"and so those papers really ,"
156150,sw4013,sd,ours start at twelve
214599,sw2611,sd,"There was , in the middle of the back of it , there was ,"
115486,sw2085,sd,"But if you paid in more than you actually used , and the same thing for insurance , what you predict your going to be paying for insurance , as long as you pay , actually pay out that amount of money , you 're okay ."
169835,sw2868,sd,and they all kind of met at a central place .
70311,sw2792,sd,and it 's really fast paced and intense .
78543,sw3365,sd,"and you take , um , s- , little bit , maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr , in a big frying pan . And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt ,"
132630,sw3587,sd,"to answer your questions earlier , yes , I , we do enjoy fishing ,"
101774,sw3254,sd,"And we live , we lived in Ohio prior to this ."
153318,sw3688,sd,I hope that works out well .
142360,sw4050,sd,They show up and all their kids .
126103,sw4917,sd,We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan .
95900,sw4026,sd,I just ended up using it .
13410,sw2483,sd,"We do n't use the radio as a wake up ,"
87048,sw3200,sd,and that was the envelope system .
197518,sw3038,sd,"And her , her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution ."
180835,sw2667,sd,"and I 've found excuses , uh --"
157961,sw2241,sd,"and the first thing the , the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said , uh , I 've got , I 've got a dozen different varieties"
85005,sw3069,sd,"it was almost like a , a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing ."
186389,sw4153,sd,"and , you know , it has a second-hand that goes around ."
81592,sw2434,sd,We traded his pistol for that shotgun .
26883,sw2821,sd,So that makes a difference .
84320,sw2382,sd,"when I became pregnant I also got meningitis ,"
4942,sw4799,sd,and I could n't get around and was n't able to do some things
182964,sw3205,sd,Today we just had a lot of rain .
46784,sw3064,sd,"And , uh , but I , I do like having them there ."
106318,sw2806,sd,"Pu- , well we put some papers on the floor ,"
206481,sw3152,sd,I mean it 's a lot of work to see that she 's prepared
159924,sw2504,sd,And I mean I was out of school .
37351,sw2562,sd,-- every year .
114931,sw2887,sd,"if I were ,"
48497,sw3734,sd,I do n't need them yet .
106889,sw3072,sd,I have n't been on vacation in a while either .
134393,sw3696,sd,"and my husband talked to the people in Utah ,"
21840,sw2437,sd,"But you wait until they go and get a car , insurance , that 's when they get expensive ."
139285,sw2630,sd,and he had an absolutely marvelous time --
40824,sw3455,sd,That 's pretty good .
158828,sw3663,sd,Yet .
89208,sw2599,sd,"And it 's funny ,"
77039,sw2734,sd,"I , I do n't care to support them ."
200684,sw3306,sd,and we never did go out again
7925,sw2232,sd,"But , I 'm concerned about the killing that went on there , because I just feel like God has a better way to handle it , than that ,"
135309,sw2661,sd,"Well , like --"
213066,sw2772,sd,"Corpus , you get that humid salty feeling in the air ."
92240,sw2566,sd,"They 've , um , they 've had police officers come in --"
171872,sw3237,sd,that was --
83200,sw2703,sd,"If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium , it 's four bucks ."
17157,sw3319,sd,I 've just never really gotten into that .
60395,sw3260,sd,"And , uh --"
14255,sw2930,sd,"Well , I love to swim ,"
193222,sw3156,sd,and all different types would go in there
111407,sw3651,sd,"and , uh , I would ,"
146557,sw3825,sd,and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree
39545,sw2935,sd,"We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought , Who 'd want to eat that stuff ."
6843,sw3253,sd,"Actually I just joined , um , the Appalachian Trail Walking Club , or whatever they call it ,"
52051,sw3709,sd,"Right now I just lift , uh , weights and do push ups and sit ups --"
64947,sw2782,sd,"because we do n't miss it ,"
100093,sw3182,sd,so we both have our expertise side .
24941,sw2623,sd,"But , uh , nevertheless retired ."
214513,sw2611,sd,"Uh , whe , you know , when they were coming up , I , I did n't sew ,"
199791,sw2399,sd,"The one I use , uh , of course , for mostly , only for business purposes is , uh , you know , American Express ."
61947,sw2597,sd,"But they , they really do ,"
22926,sw2621,sd,"well , I , I come from a large family"
55726,sw2983,sd,"But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers ,"
152737,sw3393,sd,"Uh , but , you know . We really need the rain that we 've been getting ,"
88351,sw4859,sd,"Thatcher ,"
193373,sw4127,sd,that was my weakness .
192646,sw4168,sd,"but I can remember this , the song ."
73056,sw3639,sd,"Just , just within the last three weeks ."
186533,sw4617,sd,"she 's not involved in that , that case ."
202044,sw2477,sd,"fast breaks and things and ,"
68443,sw3333,sd,"Oh , they came from a broken family --"
29408,sw3764,sd,and my office is a small office

151765,sw2589,sd,They did n't call them closets .
