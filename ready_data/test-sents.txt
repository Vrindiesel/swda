get the computers out --
reduce the violence in the prisons .
so , uh , and if you do n't have the money , then use a credit card ,
the other thing to do if you , re- , really like the hyacinths , and i do , is that before you plant those bulbs , stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them .
go ahead .
and you just need to take the little one .
if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it .
since you 're being , you can talk for hours , go ahead ,
and , um , and another question to ask is if they 're , um , state certified --
and you rotate it one time .
i guess i 'll get back to my laundry .
look at the cowboys now .

well if you , if you can get green card , go for it .
you look at frito lay .

you should n't be talking about this right before , while you 're fixing dinner .

just a second .
so , we 'll talk about that some .

so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding , well , i 'm ,
you can just light
uh , tell me where that is , uh ,
um , you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there 's a major need for that .
why do n't you do something with those ?

and that this stuff we see in the , you know , in the media is , uh ,
or ,

um .
and , uh ,
i , well , i happen to be , uh ,
a bunch of ,
and , uh , an
yes ,
th- ,
i li ,
but i kind of look at the way people treat our ,
so ,
yeah ,
con ,
i me- ,
i would n't ,
and i ,
uh ,
so , uh ,
but the ,
they , uh ,
and , um , that , that --
uh , it 's made with ,
okay ,
on my father 's side we 've really there , uh ,
and
or ,
yeah .
and so ,
but , uh , it 's ,
uh , this winter we ,
um , i guess ,
so ,
and it 's ,
well , dallas , uh ,
so .
was support ,
i 'm --
i 'm sure saddened to see ,
you now --
so .
kind of ,
to ,
but i guess ,
they 're
well , th- ,
so they ,
and so ,
i , uh ,
so .
and unfortunately .
well ,
yeah ,
well ,
just ,
because i think that ,
so i am ,
so .
or i can ,
the ,
and ,
and --
yeah .
okay ,
they 're just ,
but parents ,
but they 're --
or ,
we , uh ,
we all ,
now a family ,
so ,
it 's not ,
it seem ,
oh , that 's ,
and that there 's ,
but --
uh , was a what ,
and , uh ,
i ,
but we do have ,
huh .
but ,
that 's was ,
i mean , that is ,
well --
so i ,
and i , i think of , uh ,
the , uh , the
but , uh ,
we 're ...
and then ,
yeah .
the ,
but ,
-- for ,
and he 's ,
and , and the , the thing is the , the thing ,
it 's .
and ,
they do n't , uh ,
we ,
there 're ,
because it does ,
wh- ,
we ,
um .
but --
and that 's ,
and , um ,
so that was ,
and it ,
and so there --
i mean , i just ,
i mean cause they just ,
well ,
so , but i , i ,
well , uh , well ,
that , that 's ,
y- ,
i do n't ,
the show this weekend ,
uh it does n't ,
i ca n't think , tha- ,
yeah ,
but , uh ,
but i find it ,
and it 's , uh ,
i do n't think that i would , uh ,
i ,
yeah .
i ,
and so .
but .
um .
um .
so ,
i 'm in ,
uh ,
i really ,
oh , bar- ,
since my parents are , are , well ,
so ,
or ,
i guess , i ,
today ,
and ,
it just ,
you get some ,
um .
that ,
but ,
most ,
but she had ,
so .
-- uh , you know , to ,
but the , the actual ,
i mean ,
yes ,
so .
so ,
but otherwise , um , i guess , you know , entertaining , um ,
so that yo- ,
to the ,
and they have ,
so .
she 's ,
uh , well , brian ,
and .
i mean , it 's , uh ,
of course , we 're , we 're ,
uh .
so , you know ,
um .
and , uh ,
so --
right ,
have ,
they immediately ,
so .
and i thought ,
they got ,
so , uh ,
-- and i guess , you know , it , are ,
but ,
so .
but tha- , there 's ,
ca- ,
well ,
um .
and , yeah ,
or ,
or ,
and i- ,
we , uh ,
i gue ,
it 's a , um ,
he just never ,
or ,
if ,
i
and , and , and ,
but ,
i mean , they , you know ,
and we ,
i ,
until ,
i , i 've ,
but ,
w- ,
so .
so --
we --
but ,
and , uh , uh , you know , like my , my child that ,
well , i 'm ,
i do n't know if the dallas location ,
so .
yeah ,
so i
so it 's , it 's ,
and .
what you like .
it 's too , um , uh ,
it 's a ,
and that 's not ,
i 'm , uh ,
that 's ,
or ,
but it , it 's
it was ,
the motivational factor is probably ...
well , sh- ,
so ,
um .
you know , we ,
i 'm ,
okay .
so ,
i ,
yeah ,
i think , i , i do n't think , uh ,
yeah ,
and ,
well , i , uh ,
and often times that ,
he , i- ,
i ,
h- , h- , h- ,
yeah ,
that 's one of the ,
i was , i was just ,
and , uh ,
-- but the main ,
or just ,
that is ,
and , of course .
i ,
and , i mean , i did n't ,
but ,
well , we , uh , generally ,
i 'd certainly , uh ,
e- ,
i suspect , uh ,
and mumblex .
i .
like if you ,
he , i- ,
well , because my ,
yeah .
but .
well , yo- ,
that ,
or ,
-- he ,
so ,
uh-huh .
well ,
or ,
huh .
uh .
or ,
i 've , uh ,
i guess , i , i have , uh ,
well , i , uh , i have ,
it 's ,
yeah ,
and , uh , i- ,
and , uh ,
so .
and one of the things that we 've run into a problem ,
so .
i , i think that 's , i , you know , uh ,
i , i , uh ,
mumblex .
i like ,
and that ,
not a ,
is a ,
so .
and that .
um .
so ,
huh .
so , uh ,
are n't , uh ,
i , i think ,
yeah ,
so you have a little , you know , little ,
so i never ,
no ,
so .
um , see , i 'm not sure that ,
well , as far as that goes ,
um ,
and then i ,
uh ,
uh , i , uh , uh ,
so ,
so ,
is that
it wa- ,
which , which , uh ,
you get the impression that ,
just ,
i mean .
but if , you know ,
but ,
it ,
yeah .
these are ,
uh , and so i , you know i ,
so ,
yeah ,
and , um ,
she ,
i ,
yet .
yeah ,
but the problem is that the , uh , as with
but , uh , but otherwise you know we ,
it might be ,
and so ,
oh , well . well ...
that 's about , that as far as any other everyday occurrences ,
so ,
i , um ,
and ,
y- ,
the traffic .
and i 've ,
but , uh , anyway ,
and ,
what , w- , well ,
and , uh , .
which that ,
um .
i ,
uh .
i mean it 's , it 's almost like ,
so .
i do with ,
i was , i would just be ,
but um ,
wh ,
things that make the ,
and i ,
and so .
but i have to
you have n't , huh .
with ,
that 's ,
i , uh ,
well ,
that 's ,
she was , she is actually , um ,
so .
well , it ,
so the only one i can --
have you ,
well ,
well not the only , but , uh ,
you ca n't even ,
but it 's always , well ,
yeah .
or what is ,
oh .
we had .
i mean ,
it 's ,
but it ,
and did ,
a , uh ,
and right ,
and for some ,
and none of my ,
yeah ,
you have to --
and ,
well ,
now , i think , um ,
that 's ,
and --
p- ,
and , um , but
um .
i 've got , the ,
but that 's , uh ,
because ,
you know , i ,
and these --
it 's ,
i ,
uh , and uh ,
th- ,
that wou ,
but .
we have a ,
well ,
no ,
but , uh --
um .
and ,
or ...
so , basically that 's , that 's ,
how did you ,
but ,
so anyhow .
it 's like , like
or ,
um .
so , you 've never had ,
so , um ,
uh , but , there 's this one campsite , that it ,
that 's ,
well , yeah
yes
so .
but , uh ,
and ,
i wo ,
it just --
and ,
and it ju- ,
beginner .
and it , it ac- ,
it 's ,
and then they wo n't ,
and , um ,
i , uh , i find that , uh ,
and ,
but , uh , i do n't mind , uh , you know ,
uh , it 's a ba- ,
but ,
plus , you , um ,
and , uh , it 's ,
but , uh ,
-- and , uh , just ,
but , you know , people ,
-- and i have n't ,
um ,
and i ,
we have ,
huh .
uh , but we ,
uh , with , uh ,
huh .
uh , it ,
well , some- ,
that 's ,
and , uh ,
no ,
they , um , um ,
so , and that was ,
the fact that ,
and ,
yeah .
and , uh ,
and ,
and suppor- ,
but ,
but ,
so , and , and then when you get , you know , when you get into the full-time basis day care ,
i do n't ,
i do n't , i see , um ,
they are , well ,
the last ,
he 's ,
-- um , and it ,
it , uh ,
but ,
or som- , uh ,
bec- , you know , every , every ,
um .
when i- ,
i , i , uh , i do n't ,
so ,
yeah .
yeah .
the ,
then do n't ,
-- and , um , it 's , it 's , you know ,
i ,
and , uh , but they 're ,
think you ,
we 've been .
i ,
huh .
and it 's like ,
so that technically ,
you know ,
and , and what will we ...
it 's been ,
um .
uh ,
that 's his , that 's his ,
i ,
but ,
but , uh ,
but ,
i do n't --
so , i guess that ,
the , uh ,
but down ,
but ,
i mean , how , you know , is --
and mumblex --
so car- ,
i , you know , othe- ,
and , uh , i ,
so .
so ,
so ,
well ,
e- ,
and ,
it , it 's ,
i , i li- ,
well , i do n't , you know ,
becau- ,
that 's ,
so ,
i feel th- ,
and it just ,
and had ,
yeah ,
that
that ,
and , uh , as soon as , as we can get ,
it 's like about maybe
i would assume it 's , you know , if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that .
you know ,
i think that ,
we used to ,
but , uh , i , uh , fo- ,
usually there 's , uh ,
so i 'm sure that ,
oh , well .
it ,
and i ,
i think they ,
i mean , you know .
yeah ,
i mean , that ,
it , uh ,
how about , uh , let 's see , about ten years ago ,
well it 's , it 's ,
when ,
and .
i ,
but , uh ,
they , they 're ,
yeah .
i , uh ,
here they ,
but it 's ,
but , but , but when ,
but , uh ,
people ,
and ,
and then there 's places , um ,
yeah ,
i , i really now , n- , n- ,
uh , you know , being , uh ,
ok
wa- , to say that , uh , those ...
and , and , uh , you know .
-- and , uh , so ,
uh .
i mean , what would it take ,
or ,
yeah .
maybe that ,
yeah .
yeah ,
course ,
how ,
and they also ,
but ,
yeah ,
i think , i ,
is --
but yeah ,
and ,
but , um , but , yes ,
well ,
the ,
you give
oh , it was , uh , it was ,
and they , they ,
that 's ,
wi- , with the , so much , uh ,
or , you know .
oh , the ,
and that 's also ,
but um ,
any way , this , this , um , school system thing ,
uh-huh .
or ,
but now i ,
so .
to ,
uh , i guess it 's , uh ,
tha- ,
so ,
and so ...
so , uh , that 's the type ,
and ,
and he , he 's
it 's just ,
so .
uh , our ,
oh , it just ,
yeah .
and , and , oh , of course , they ,
and ,
so ,
uh .
well ,
well , anyway i , uh , i , uh , oh ,
but ,
so that ,
but ,
and , uh , yo- ,
so that 's kind of ,
so that was ,
uh , i 'm ,
but ...
and then the families ,
so .
yeah .
but that 's ,
so .
it 's not ,
well ,
huh .
on the ,
but , uh ,
well , i mean , there 's like , well
i mean , uh , it 's ,
i mean it- ,
oh that 's ,
i g-
uh , but this one is , uh , is
you 're a calcu , you know
huh .
and i , uh , you know ,
say ,
well , hopefully once they have , uh , you know , once they 've checked them off the list
so ,
well ,
so we are just .
logically ,
because ,
and , uh ,
have you ,
yeah ,
uh .
or ,
-- mumblex people moving as much .
so you ,
um .
i mean even to ,
and .
and i ,
so the ,
um .
so ,
i ha- ,
they ,
but it 's , it 's real , uh ,
but it 's ,
um .
well , i guess , um ,
it was n't ,
well , i , you know , in terms of , in terms of any sorts of trends i , you know ,
after all , we 're ,
okay ,
so i 'm ,
there 's ,
so ,
by the campsite , it 's so ,
so that ,
but , uh ,
they ,
and , you know , so it 's ,
but ,
i watch , uh , huh .
and , uh , they ma- ,
that 's ,
and , uh ,
i 've ,
uh , also ,
so --
so we ,
sh- ,
now like my ...
so .
i do n't ,
it ,
but we just ,
so uh , it , it , it always ,
uh , so ,
oh .
it 's , it 's
okay ,
and have ,
yeah .
and they ,
and i guess to curb , uh ,
i , uh ,
so .
that 's ,
but , uh ,
-- so , but , uh , yeah ,
you know , i read , you know ,
i , um ,
so ,
and that ,
huh .
but , uh ,
and mumblex .
so .
and , uh ,
it 's , uh , the ,
and , and , uh .
it does every ,
and in the mi- , you know ,
it 's , uh .
we ,
because we started ,
and , uh .
and ,
yeah .
uh ,
th- ,
but i do not ,
so ,
so ,
but , uh .
but , you know , that 's ,
actually , i 'm in ,
yea- ,
and i thi ,
it ,
there ,
hm .
and .
i had a , uh ,
but they are --
um , i ,
um .
it w- ,
uh , i guess uh , it ,
oh okay .
and , uh , we 've got about ,
yeah .
huh .
um ,
so ,
do ,
i mean ,
it just , it 's , uh ,
and ,
but we , um , we ,
i think ,
so ,
who you 're ,
yeah .
so i gue ,
did you ,
little ,
and , uh --
i just ,
but , uh , i certainly , um ,
that 's one part of the world ,
it does n't ,
that 's , that 's why this ,
so ,
i kind of have to ,
another reason , yo- ,
they y- ,
i mean it was
-- uh ,
you know what i ,
have a ,
they ,
i , i ,
huh .
huh .
and you know --
oh that 's ,
just ,
but , you know .
it 's , it 's uh ,
aunt and uncle ,
yeah .
yeah ,
so ,
so .
-- but , um , we were , i mean , um ,
so .
i think that , i think he really ,
and , uh ,
and get a ,
oh it 's , it 's ter- ,
yeah --
uh ,
so , you know .
what
and it ,
well ...
and , uh ,
or ,
what ,
well .
so that 's ,
i , i think ,
um .
and they
but ,
um .
but ,
and , uh , that 's ,
or ,
but , uh , you know , we have , uh , well ,
what , wh ,
i just
i , i ,
i ,
is she ?
but , uh , well how they 'll , you know ,
in fact , my problem ,
lud- ,
but ,
mumblex taxes .
you know , and n- , no other state ,
um , we ,
so . yeah .
or ?
well he 's ,
and that 's , uh ,
that 's
-- and , uh , i just , you know ,
yeah .
and that 's kind of like ,
i .
but ,
what , you know ,
and , uh ,
and , uh , it ,
we ,
you know , so .
uh , but , uh , anyway , but , okay .
because , i mean , graduate school or whatever ,
and , uh ,
and i , you know , i , i still like ,
uh ,
we ,
so .
it 's probably ,
yo- ,
i mean , they a- , ,
yeah .
i guess i ,
no longer ,
i was , i was ,
i think a lot of ,
but , uh , at least , we ,
but , um , yeah ,
well , i ,
it just , uh , i 'm just not ,
so --
and they then ,
i , i
what kind
but , uh ,
i do n't , you know .
and , uh ,
or ,
um , and i- , i- , it , it ,
we , uh ,
but ,
yeah .
and it , uh , it was kind of ,
and i really , you know ,
so ,
m- ,
only ,
so , but i think they d- ,
you know , you must ,
and we ,
and ,
but ,
so .
and ,
the last one , well ,
wh- ,
and also i think ,
uh ,
that , uh ,
no .
did , did they ,
so it 's
um .
so .
most .
mostly it 's , uh ,
it 's about two hours ,
and my closet
that 's kind of what , like
have a ,
i mean ...
so .
and um , those that are n't ,
i , you know , i , uh .
yeah .
uh , that
but , uh ,
so , uh ,
but ,
well , the , uh , uh ,
see , and ,
so , uh , i , i guess ,
then , then ,
that
-- and , uh , and i ,
but ,
like , a , a song ,
and ,
size wise
and ...
so ,
and , uh , so , it ,
uh , for the ,
what , what can you .
yeah ,
there 's really ,
you d- ,
but ,
taxes ,
you know , but i was n't ,
and ,
so .
it gets to be , uh ,
-- it 's too ,
uh , not only that
um .
so ,
and they 're , uh ,
i mean ,
i , i ,
say ,
and you ca n't really ,
and then ,
i do n't ,
and , uh , course this ,
the van pools i know that ,
and i ,
somehow ,
so .
it , you know ,
yeah ,
and ,
but , uh ,
or ,
when is this good or not good .
bec- ,
so . you know ,
and ,
and ,
and um , so that 's , that 's why i try and , uh , do ,
uh-huh .
uh , and it , uh ,
um .
yeah ,
so i --
so .
so you know , they ,
for ho- , why , why , why pieces ,
you know , it 's just , um ,
we 've , uh ,
and ,
but ,
it would ,
but it 's , uh , i- , that , you know , if what it 's going to take ,
and i- ,
and , and you could n't get ,
so it was a , it was a , you know ,
they ,
and ,
and , uh , of course flying , uh ,
so .
steve , this is ,
and , uh , other th- , uh ,
or ,
and ,
um , t i ,
so ,
um , yeah ,
right --
it ,
so , it ,
that 's ,
uh , i do n't think ,
huh .
so , not ,
so ,

no ,
well , no ,
no ,
no .
no ,
no ,
no .
no .
um , yes and no .
i do n't know ,
well , each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please , uh ,
i guess so .
oh , it 's uh , scaled back considerably .
i do n't know --
well , i really do n't know .
i , i do n't know .
oh , i have no idea .
uh , i really do not remember ,
i do n't know ,
si- ,
uh , i guess ,
maybe it is ,
i do n't know .
um , i might of .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
well , i do n't know .
oh , i do n't even know .
i do n't know ,
boy , i , i do n't know .
uh , i would n't say that .
oh , i follow the , uh , the cowboys
what they did was ,
uh , i do n't remember .
well , he 's giving me an estimate .
well i think that was part of it ,
i do n't know .
oh constantly .
right .
they do ,
i suppose so .
right .
you guys are getting into it more than we are .
i 've lived in san diego for six years when i was a ki- , younger , and l a area ,
i do .
i certainly do .
sure ,
oh , definitely .
um , somewhat .
and , uh , from vietnam .
oh , money is always a factor in my life ,
oh , sure ,
very much so ,
i get the feeling that a lot of people have .
uh , in general .
i think ,
portland .
uh , i love to read , but i , you know , i do n't have a lot of time to read an ,
four door ,
portland .
i do .
right
quite a few do .
i did , uh ,
uh , they , they do it before you go in
you can ,
right ,
exactly ,
right .
and the movie was awful .
that would be , certainly be a deterrent .
right .
very much so ,
uh , just in junior high --
he , he kind of has free run of the place , and there is some- , or somebody takes care of him .
right --
right ,
right .
every once in a while i , i like to go on the nights when there 's not anybody out there , not very many people out there .
i do .
well , it is to me .
it really is
absolutely .
i like it .
i read a book while i 'm doing it .
-- blazing saddles .
definitely .
it is a pretty rough area .
n- , got , of the six , we 've got four around here .
right ,
i have some friends that have children , uh , not that many actually .
right .
uh , used oil base paints for trim --
uh , i have twice .
oh , it 's beautiful .
uh , i 've got one little girl .
oh i do .
we have all kinds of testing
i believe it does have to be unanimous , actually .
oh , it sure is .
i think so .
with p c -s they 're either i b m or i b m compatible , mostly .
oh , absolutely .
i 've got one .
right .
we like it .
uh , chrysler lebaron ,
we do .
well , yeah , i think the teachers d , uh , did ,
uh , some of them .
sure .
oh , we do have kmart here ,
he 's in elementary school .
i have a , a little bit ,
they do n't do it for drugs ,
right ,
it was kind of pot luck .
right .
oh --
right ,
okay .
or even accepting them .
-- compared to the , the total decision it 's nothing .
they 're winning forty-one to seven .
because , uh , treated wood will also chew them up .
-- to watch college on saturday , and then of course cowboys on sunday .
absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in ,
or yard work or anything , put the radio on and listen to that .
troublesome sports ,
and , uh , it 's going to be going off the air , uh , let 's see , a week from fri- , a week from tonight .
more of what it is you 're doing , why you 're doing it , how you 're it 's done and ,
-- that twangy stuff ,
in the i b program at garland .
but i work at home .
-- depending on , on what she did .
four or five years ?
-- that you can go and get cash on .
given all your training i 'm sure that , you know , you 'd ,
stuff like that .
it , you know , a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you 're over the limit on the credit card .
-- and , and such .
-- which seems pretty sensible .
-- the , kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that .
on the --
if they give you card ,
and , and running , you know , a line in there for my iron so i could do it in there
-- and value down
and try to get money from him
-- my gosh .
we use to go up there on , uh , for football games sometimes .
-- or north dallas .
and where there was , uh , caring and compassionate , where there were caring and compassionate people , uh , operating it .
-- uh , even attitudes --
i do n't know what 's , how they do the flour .
you know ,
-- but some of them are not ,
-- got your worth out of it anyway .
-- takes your calls and all that stuff ?
you know , butcher them if they get fat ? ''
keep it going .
-- want to think everything can be improved upon --
men are starting ,
-- well , especially after they get married .
-- you know , when you 're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out ,
-- if you , if you save so much , then they will match it .
-- new things like that because like i told my husband this summer , i love to eat , you know , chicken salad and tuna salad --
because , um , it was important to me to , to spend some time with kids .
-- it , it is possible that , you know , that they ca n't do as good a job , uh , as they might do .
-- near pittsburgh .
-- this past week ,
which is further south .
which is the strangest thing i had ever heard .
-- killed it .
-- you can really see it .
-- out .
-- i was wrong .
-- sideline , part time thing .
-- uh , a gut level reaction .
-- when they start showing the drawings and all that , i 'm sure , you know , when they ,
-- you know , i 've seen , uh , i 've seen cases on , in the news and all where , where , you know , uh , a , a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder .
excus , uh ,
my answer is no thank you , i do n't need it .
-- super --
well , nowadays you have to be .
at a , at a , at a college .
after that you realize they are just as afraid of you , too .
-- dragged on .
s- , do some sort of , you know , drug testing .
went back to work about a year and a half ago
so now they 're going to get even .
-- i heard mixed publicity --
-- sales tax .
you know , what system you 're getting it through .
-- and , you know , have some idea of how much was there , you know , i 'd sent them , you know , several hundred dollars , or whatever --
-- your , uh ,
-- anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system .
-- see these players you see on t v to , and to hear that ball go whizzing by .
-- thing ,
-- for example .
uh , late seventies , i mean .
some potato chips
for me ,
fort worth newspaper .
and , and , of course ,
-- on a , on a hook , but never the snakes .
-- peace of mind also .
-- that 's , that 's good .
because of all the costs of the appeals and all that --
-- driver 's licenses , checks , things like that .
have just come back and was doing consulting work .
-- that negotiations could n't resolve .
leaving a message ,
really well .
-- you should n't be --
yes .
-- of that , yeah .
i know they do n't .
-- but since last time we 've gotten more like a dollar .
-- they had the little door underneath the hood .
-- like that .
which y- , you actually are like sitting around not doing anything .
they , they ,
-- certainly comparable .
which is right in between waco and austin on the freeway .
a good part thing .
that 's just too far away .
yeah ,
-- they 're ,
-- and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like , oh , were kind of traditionally the school 's roles .
-- before they eat .
-- and , uh , copper ,
-- just on an economic point of view , if the soviet union does n't do something fast they are , they ai n't going to be able to feed their people this ,
-- the baseboards and things like that .
-- that , you , you 're either boating or you 're fishing --
um , which i also had done , had just , you know , they were very sad .
it , it 's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day .
something .
-- and do more .
to see how much was going to be left ,
-- from us .
-- is , is , you know , to reduce , uh , the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they 're going to get off early .
it 's really ,
-- out in addison
-- and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too , if they do n't take , if they do n't take that early stand .
-- income .
bags some , their most recent , uh , needle craft --
the crime rate is the worst than ever before .
and stuff like that
and carry it over to there , and see if they 're not using the printer ,
-- people do n't have room for that kind of stuff .
-- you know ,
-- cards and just sent them back , you know .
and get something for them .
get out of that , run the program ,
uh , him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something .
in your music and things .
-- i think .
just , it never crosses my mind .
that really has changed the way , uh , i look at the news .
-- it is going to be to late .
about an hour south of tampa .
what was his name , uh ,
you know , where is this person coming in from ,
-- you know .
-- as far as aid is concerned ,
-- rip your skin .
-- usually a company , it will , if it 's worth it 's weight , will subsidize ,
of a car .
-- president someday , maybe .
easier targets --
-- stuff like that .
-- people telling me i want things .
um , but it does not , uh ,
as it turns out , uh , i went and took some lessons for awhile , because i just , i would lose so many balls , and , uh , make it a horrible time for everybody .
i firmly believe in that
and then , uh , got s- ,
who are in , uh , controlling positions ,
-- s- , series , you know , just something a little different ,
-- and love the water , um , and we thought that was kind of a tough climate --
and then one complete seafood buffet .
before
-- i do n't find that to be a behavioral problem .
that 's what
yeah .
-- happen with the house , that you have to have money for and , uh , not enough to go and to take a loan out , but , uh , you have to have money for .
and blooming .
-- a lot more common sense --
-- you know ,
-- that just about breaks the bank right there .
-- guess , hopefully i will have more time for hobbies .
-- that , that would actually ever work .
texas , called p m melody , who does a lot of writing on co-dependency .
that ,
-- but not in the guilt or innocence because he has n't been , he has n't been found guilty of it .
-- and adults and particularly in , in responsible positions , have not , uh , i do n't think have , had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases
sometimes .
summer and winter ,
because i 'm probably not going to stop eating it .
and , uh , then moved to dallas about three years ago .
-- such as rape , deserves punishment by death .
but here 's the amount , that , that t i is going to pay for it ,
the nightmare on elm street ,
because they 'll take a classic and , and , uh , televise it --
-- and they 've all moved , you know , on .
-- i thought , gosh , summer time , you know .
because she 's blind ,
-- that it was already a problem .
recycle , because we , there is some bins , like behind wal-mart , that take some things .
-- when , when ,
-- quit the wondering
-- assisting them with their children --
they 're all grown and on their own
social ,
their , on its per diem for exchange rate .
though i think , i think we 're supposed to have something impame- , implemented by nineteen ninety-three , though --
and
versus a democratic , uh , government and , arguing successfully , why , the united states should be a republic , not a democracy . which indeed it really is , a republic , not a democracy .
because the graduate assistantship really does n't cover , the ten thousand dollars in tuition , really does n't cover living expenses . um ,
-- on a certain area of our home growing up ,
and the house and that kind of thing .
-- i do n't worry about it
it still looked real nice ,
-- constantly .
any biographies .
-- and they do n't have rehearsals during that time period .
-- and go jogging for , uh --
that 's wonderful .
-- if it was true there , i 'm sure it 's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is --
and have enthusiasm .
and that 's only the only time we can go out ,
that would be all the more reason that they 'd take advantage of you .
or biology department , one or the other , anyway , uh ,
five years ,
to grab your attention .
-- than we had growing up --
or something ?
or the military to sway to their side , i think that , uh , it will be on the way out eventually .
-- who abused them --
i know , i know they 're working with him
-- that we 've , we 've really liked ,
-- two or three hours on the weekends ,
-- and things like that --
only be one or the other .
no ,
-- biggest bargain in the world .
-- i 've moved around a lot .
on to it ,
she was always a little bit leery of her .
-- trying to negotiate , trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there .
the movie , oh ,
you know , like ,
before hand .
-- there 's a big opportunity for us to explore , uh , what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment .
way back when .
uh , accept for the private ones , of course , we 're talking about public .
-- of x number of billion , trillion dollars a year .
-- except for when you get , like i said , into the real hard rock ,
i do n't think ,
just more aware of her jer- , you know ,
a japanese car ,
texas ,
-- literature .
-- uh , you know , to , to alleviate ,
-- uh , disneyworld is the one for a week next year --
-- i do n't care how much they take off of you , you know --
and everything
oh , i see .
ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um
-- and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that 's more fair .
accept for what we give to my daughter , to , you know , put her through college and stuff .
-- absolutely no money involved whatsoever ,
-- that 's all i 've seen in offices , is i b m .
uh , verses having her go down here and not learn anything ,
felt that it certainly was ,
fooled with that checkbook , you know .
it again .
you know , each , like , uh , a , an appetizer ,
-- in the country , maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now .
and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
has been a real problem .
all the , all the ya .
to see it .
-- standard ?
-- think so .
-- not just sentencing in , in a criminal cases .
pay for the classes and stuff
and everything is a long story .
uh , junior ,
-- and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time .
that you would think it would be easy to correct .
clothes that are in between where you 're not down to regular size yet --
i needed that , you know ,
well , we , i 've never , never listened .
-- and not even worry about it .
at this point .
we saw , uh , the , the , uh , movie with , uh , sylvester stallone , oscar .
you know ?
if y- , they 're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that .
in the event of a separation or whatever .
uh , that he had three jobs
-- my window sill ,
i have n't tried before
where you can take them
around them ,
you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to , to mothers .
at a took that away as far as being ,
i could n't afford to start again .
alterations and sewing .
drugs of course , uh , a big part of it i think .
she dressed him , uh , fabulously .
-- fluffy and , you know , looked like it came right from the north pole ,
the feeling that it mumblex
the treaty over there right now .
they save a lot of , they save a lot of energy
you know , after , after an entire semester ,
-- to keep the monthly payment low .
had that delivered and ,
and in my youngsters ,
-- how much that bothers you .
uh , a neighbor to a neighbor --
-- um , so that , um , you know , i do n't know , i just feel it would be good for them to do that .
i go
-- i 've seen some of them like that too
-- what my , what i was going to study
-- you know ,
half way acquainted that way .
if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to , to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait .
relationships with ,
and with rollers and , uh , modern latex paints ,
-- as far as me seeing it , you know ,
-- for where you can put a house next to a ,
it was so cheap .
to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds .
it was , spanish and english ,
-- for breakfast a long time .
where they 're always chasing or fighting ,
-- women have played in the last pup- , couple of year in our , or couple of generations .
-- going on ,
-- going to say , i hear a baby in the background .
i just think that it 's kind of , i do n't know , it 's kind of cruel .
-- movie .
to see that , and another day fish hatchery ,
i have heard it is pretty good .
-- you know .
-- older old people .
-- interested in it too .
because it 's all either mcdonald 's or dairy queens ,
that , um ,
-- to rent those kind of cars .
-- who are , who are draining a lot of money right now . you know ,
uh , i think you , the , the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and , and , uh , more classical style of clothing .
and , the ,
-- looking around like you 've never been there before --
or on asphalt .
that were in the dumpsters .
i , i often ,
-- and all . then , uh , and the importance of it because , okay , if you do n't vote for your friend over here , well your friend 's not going to have a chance .
-- so , uh , i only work part time ,
-- and , uh , also u of m seemed overwhelming in size
-- do n't do much cooking for him yet .
-- activities
just a hassle when you know ,
you know .
-- like music videos , that go along with the songs about church and jesus .
uh , even jobs . uh , jobs that would normally go to an american , with a lesser education , might be going to , to some of these people here .
yes ,
find a place that we like
-- things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing --
we had some people come in and , uh , like attack one of the planes . because they were protesting , uh ,
-- and , uh , be more formal because i had a , a formal meeting at noon time ,
me either .
-- in spite of everything we can do
there 's money out there .
it would be just futile .
-- just channel eight .
-- for a year which is a lot .
drafting , not grafting ,
yes .
you know , so it 's , it 's very different
that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings .
-- be with other people .
-- it encourages them not to , uh , complain when they realize that they get a part of the , of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying , well make me do it .
-- um , because i enjoyed some of those stories so much ,
wh , when does it bloom ?
-- where you know you go to buy a hand gun
you know .
because you can get it there , you know --
-- the plastic ones , they 've got numbers on them .
-- common sense not , not to --
i mean , co , cook at five and eat at six , rather .
you know , we 're acutely aware of a lot of this .
when they 're home .
-- it permits the criminal to get a retrial .
-- not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard --
-- in this one large open area ,
-- um , maybe that would start the trend back because that 's one of the things i always thought was a wonderful part of our country . um , --
-- i mean , you 've got to do something .
latitudes that the police had ,
some kind of chemicals in there too .
-- which , uh , or should never have gone to court .
just trying to try and stay as firm as i can stay in my old age .
did you --
-- this sort of stuff .
-- and just pay for it .
-- you know ,
in society
which is why they could n't sell it ,
much that i say ,
-- and go .
and finding a school that , that met her specific requirements ,
-- you want a nincompoop jury because they 'll sympathize with you a bit --
and everything else .
-- never did that .
-- banks of the nile .
-- but the ne- , news , news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event , which is something that 's good also about c span which i , i tune into every once in a while .
any more .
-- with it .
that , that are really more of an education that ,
-- i think we 're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast .
partly , be- , partly for the cats ,
here in texas sort of thing ,
-- on baseball tea- ,
and some psychology .
and not breaking the , uh , the , uh , pasta .
uh , when you core it , you be real careful so you wo n't knock your flowers off .
-- and protecting the earth .
-- give me one .
um , a lot of our neighbors say , well , what , you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it 's that ,
-- just having handguns around to , to have them , i do n't believe that you should have handguns around .
would say , you know , what did you do today ,
you know , all these , uh , i , i , intangible things
and do it and stuff ,
-- are later printed , though .
and become eagle scouts .
-- just ,
-- pointless ,
-- so i would always trust her judgment on that .
-- and i- , it was kind of interesting to see that , that it was actually the man in the group that , that did that side of it .
-- at school today .
-- um , in just having to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need .
-- little use that i 've gotten from my router , i would say , uh , i would spend my money on the bits .
primarily , you know , with the quarterbacks .
-- we 're pretty strung out all over .
from your histories lessons or whatever .
-- and three ounces of apricot preserves --
-- so forth ,
and , and you have to really get them when they are young , in order to have , uh , not , uh , a decent smile when they are fifteen , sixteen years old .
-- is five minutes .
you know .
-- you know , unstable .
-- you know ,
-- even though it 's a duplex , you can still buy .
and uh , trying to connect with israel all that time
and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup , you know ,
put all the money into the expansion box and all this , that and the other
-- uh , like really ,
even .
you do it .
-- do you get that come- .
uh , besides that .
you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and , and just really ,
if not more
but , uh ,
when you have the big old trees .
-- it 's working up to a year now ,
-- in seconds .
it did n't change
lots of them on the market .
like i could n't ride my bike across the street , but they could because their mom would never know it .
said that it was the drunk driver 's fault
-- bought some baby clothes , yeah , last weekend at a garage sale .
-- because we do n't want to have garage sales or anything like that --
salesperson .
-- and so i do n't have any benefits at all
i mean high interest ,
it was tiring .
-- do quite a bit of that .
-- uh , in , in terms of getting them down .
that , uh , i have , you know , the car 's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
the junior highs .
-- and , uh , through work .
-- and stay
you know ,
that i got all those bricks for forty dollars .
-- or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be ,
-- and that has saved us thousands of dollars , you know , from mumblex to mechanic to --
what they have discovered .
-- company that puts out one , two , three --
that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
go into fourteen hundred episodes .
taken up by the ,
and try to adjust to , to why they were there .
-- so it 's costing more all around in health insurance --
not used p c 's that much ,
we 're expecting too much out of them .
-- to , to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever --
here .
-- and taking my l s a t -s on june tenth .
-- you know ,
-- of an evening .
-- as well as single family homes ,
drives a honda .
it was all cotton fields ,
i was three when we moved back here .
and things like that
tell them what you 're interested in .
-- then we 'll ,
-- rates --
-- in the future .
and , you know , seem to excel .
-- fact , they were all in , uh , over the weekend for easter .
of virginia i 'm ,
where 's bob ? or what about bob ?
to do that sort of thing .
they have , have the , all they have are me- , uh , mesquite and cottonwoods ,
-- because of all that ,
-- with a good technical program ,
-- you know , especially when you , um --
um , to all of a sudden , uh , search for mumblex attitudes and whatnot .
-- that rainy season .
uh , you know , i do n't really feel as though i 've a gotten sufficient , uh , you know , dose of news that way .
but , uh ,
well , i ca n't think of a time that i 've been fishing that i have n't run into one or two of them .
you know , especially when it 's all phony .
and i still have this slice ,
-- coverage that we receive .
is really good too .
what time is it there , ten thirty ?
-- anyway ,
a lot of
what they can do with the rest of the world .
-- for money , or whatever .
you know .
sometimes it 's , it 's pretty bad here .
you know , or anything like that
and cans here at work
just wanted the degree .
-- to promote themselves .
so sometimes it 's hard for me to do that ,
-- you know , even though right now i 'm not driving an american car ,
-- way or another .
have references ,
she was from saint louis ,
and it seem ,
trees and stuff on it
uh , deal i hate to see .
if you 're walking on them , feel how filthy they were .
-- both working at whatever things were , needed to be done .
and especially when they are assaulting ,
on saturday nights , here at least .
you know ,
and great grandchildren
-- instead of just writing checks for things .
play basketball , you know .
wonderful o and the thirteen clocks , that have been out of print for about , oh , i think about twenty years .
basically , um ,
is it going to be really dry ?
-- when i 'm taking an order or something ,
more of the volunteer network service .
there is a , a theory , at least , that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of erga .
-- to , to give .
but drafting course ,
-- that charges it .
do that for , yeah ,
golfers
advertising on that kind of stuff .
-- when you go shopping .
you can , uh , you can get ,
-- i 'd look elsewhere , yeah .
-- and not , uh , a very good finish .
-- to it , where you get that bachelor 's .
um , and then i have a shady area that i need to , uh , be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun ,
-- would you give ?
-- or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days .
-- yeah ,
i guess , you know , it 's , it 's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to , like to practice even mumblex .
in , control it ,
-- uh , you 'll find in the , in the journal .
with no scratches nothing . you know , a few bruises .
uh , i have n't done so much as , uh , watch the tape that i made .
-- but close ,
-- lake sam rayburn --
we 've been to from barbecue to ,
old copies then .
-- uh , activities like that , sure .
out of an office every day . that ,
-- the engines are different
where you put away the people that are so bad that , uh , you do n't want them out in circulation .
griffins air force base .
-- they wait until they are , you know , unable .
hobby though more than a vehicle .
spots and ,
and taken the precautions .
in one small community .
-- that she , that she can watch .
and , uh , actually , pirogies and all that stuff that , uh ,
pretty rough thing to be , uh , electrocuted .
-- about what they had done .
revolting themselves ,
-- uh , just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here ,
-- instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time .
but it 's ,
because i too , have very small kids .
-- we 're just about right .
they ,
which was just absolutely fantastic .
are both want the extent of extremes so that they do n't give anything for a balance
one can of flake .
for everything ,
but , okay , so d , wait
are the same way .
you know
to have the ham cooking . uh , rather than that , we just ,
-- school or stuff , that this , the juries being involved in the sentencing was n't , was n't so much .
it was really wonderful .
-- these days in the classroom .
i 'm , uh ,
which is good enough ,
people thought differently ,
and from corporations around the , around the city , you know , for aids research and that kind of thing
talking with you .
-- you know , ambition to use , have high powered weapons or something .
you know , children 's games .
you know ,
-- uh , department of , uh , uh , their home ec department --
it 's about thirty-five hundred square feet .
he would be stoned .
you know to get along , too ,
inmates all the time that are coming up for parole .
day after day after day .
-- the , the book was so much , uh ,
-- to find out what was going on on that .
cleaning up , or picking up dirt , or weeds , or who knows what . something for the , for the state ,
is n't it ?
-- or asphalt .
you know , going in one big swoop , save up and then buy it .
we could n't call in .
-- it 's , it 's almost four hundred hou- ,
it 's a nice kind of way to be spoiled .
that may be the , all right because we had , because we have some , we have some old fruit trees .
the first , like say , six ,
because it keeps track of all your footnotes .
-- as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard .
-- if that 's a weakness , that 's a good thing to do .
yeah .
-- because , you know , at the end of your day you want time for yourself --
-- know if we 're , our time is up or what .
uh , oh , timing belts and things like that .
-- and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones are n't --
so , as far as out of the house .
-- house .
-- that kind of money .
-- and garden .
they certainly ,
-- so the mother ca n't get to them either .
nobody is going to , you know , reprimand them or ,
that way .
-- teach them that it is .
-- or whatever .
-- and i do n't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it .
-- when my kids get in bed
-- and not really interested in some of the , like the terminator or some of the schwarzenegger stuff .
-- uh , have really enjoyed it because --
that suddenly was n't necessary any more .
-- we turned everything we could ,
-- hardly .
turkey breasts .
and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there , and everywhere , it all adds up .
-- once you get the whole story
-- from there to sacramento .
are gone .
-- which you ca n't blame them for that --
uh , though i have n't gone on any extended trips with it .
i do n't think they , they consider ,
-- we 'll ,
-- that sit in and listen so that there 's no way that you could have like a crooked judge .
i mean you do ,
things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
that way , than try to locate it , you know ,
-- for helping us out .
and have that sway their decisions one way or the other .
-- i 'm not talking about just in the school system .
a lot better .
so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases , you know
like it to take .
and all of that .
and i think we sing better because of that .
had that rain storm and freezing weather .
uh , sh- ,
-- uh , become , well , die or whatever .
-- did n't know how to work the machines .
college courses ,
-- so i could graduate .
in one neighborhood ,
bruno kirby ,
because they get stuck doing it all .
enjoyed them .
-- and just leave the skin on and , uh , do it with , uh , butter on , uh , on , on tin foil --
you know .
and take your sick leave .
-- you know ,
-- getting older and , uh , not sure that 's something i want to do .
get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
-- or innocent --
way we felt .
-- , so i mostly depend on the radio , you know , on the way to work .
you do n't have the view .
-- then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that , you know .
a- , you know ,
-- to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion , i believe --
-- just shining right down on them , you know --
-- if you do n't keep them weeded out , they almost take over .
-- in , in the plant .
do you think , um ,
-- the same person every day .
it 's always , they 're always challenging to get through one of them .
-- was planning on marketing a , uh , c d rom with people 's names sorted by number of different criteria .
okay ?
and things of that sort ,
where there are more than one family in a house .
-- that , i do n't know what 's wrong with the people , uh ,
i think he mumblex the calculation at home ,
-- than these kids that do n't have that responsibility .
-- you know , three months ,
-- top level .
or self improvement .
it would be money better spent than ,
-- on a card --
-- complicate it by saying , you know , we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock .
-- when you use something called couscous .
-- and , uh , on long island ,
that can hold up what i consider the proper sentencing ,
to give it a little more body .
we 'd probably go .
-- what we have .
it 's a really ,
ridden ,
-- that may , that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem .
-- for , um , different ,
i 've heard that some of the information , uh , is prevented from reaching the jury , like , uh , mitigating circumstances or , or preceding , uh , criminal record or things of this nature that ,
that 's not really hard rock .
-- community service now .
it 's our responsibility ,
they 're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated .
we were really , highly concerned about it
that i 'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that , that i encounter in the work place ,
-- that .
-- mobile and --
you know , and have you come in , you know ,
texas are you , if i could ask ?
or a doctor or anything else .
-- and he was using his mumblex charge card too .
had came up with the maximum sentence --
how to handle things in situations .
uh , especially today .
-- so that , well , they , they , they , uh , they have a pretty good idea of , of , uh , what the number of fish are in these various locations ,
-- is that what you 're talking about ?
-- and just uh , she 's not going to die .
have their own room .
-- and not just the teachers .
-- to pay for the payments on the credit card .
-- there is a further traction control , uh ,
-- the finance charge , which is kind of , you know ,
with larry bird back , uh ,
then i 'm going to go to sulphur springs .
he 's got a way to get in ,
-- willing to buy ones that are about ,
-- so he can eat .
-- you know .
to account for that .
-- that i 've , uh , beefed up a little bit --
-- not because it 's realistic , but it 's entertaining .
-- from the --
probably looking for your kids
-- you know .
things like that ,
-- on that ,
-- who are more active .
and , you know , if i know that they 're going to be there , you know , you , i try to really watch it and like you say , you know , really dress up
and , uh , the way in which people speak .
-- that it would just have to be a hobby ,
unless they 're just absolutely forced to .
-- outside the one entrance , that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started , and so on , and so on .
-- and all those , you know , demographics studies that they do that , um , you know , have , who knows , how much , you know , stuff about all the purchases that you 've made and everything kept tract somewhere
-- for another thirty minutes .
out there ,
-- uh , one of the things that , you know , i had discovered is that if they knew that i came in there at all different hours , they got much better care than if ,
-- and use those hours to do .
just with these , with these all passing it from one to the other .
-- they won by two points .
-- did the entire room with .
that they send you these things that look like checks ,
because if you could knit , you could crochet .
then they 'll automatically come on . um ,
and her aluminum ,
on the coast .
-- self evaluation .
-- and such .
we do n't have a big problem with turtles ,
you know ?
-- there are , there are so many , there are so many people in prison .
to , to also , uh , make statements ,
-- in the string beans .
and a lot of it 's because , you know , i got a lot of people , you know , at work with and everything that are big redskin fans .
-- if they , if they see you 're up , you know --
right now if you ask my friends t- , put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children , you 're going to have twenty hands , you know , up there .
-- i think for the different procedures .
-- when it 's doing the things it 's doing .
-- i guess .
-- and blueberry bushes and things .
-- and a couple of ladies ran a stop light ,
i do n't think anybody would care .
most of the , of the next generation is going to be in , or , or an , ex- ,
six , sixth , sixth grade , you know ,
will respect .
-- i 've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable .
-- that they 're so good at it .
i think i , that was ingrained in me during my family time at home .
you know .
-- ideas .
-- probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place .
-- and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and , uh , you know , hang on to the one i 've got for a few years because it 's , it 's , it 's almost four years old ,
get homework done ,
-- you , you know , quite a bit
so that 's , that 's going to be a big help to dallas ,
and , uh ,
you know , or , or it is hanging by a thread , they still ca n't put it back together now .
and designing women .
-- that the husband is having them , on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home .
-- uh , sort of a , a family type ,
-- she 'll , she makes us go outside ,
because they 're really into it .
-- uh , just loves d- , dick vitelle , which not many people do .
-- so much as , we just want to help people out .
-- and the cruise control .
that 's true , because um m- b- a lot of um these conversations i 've had on this program this
because they would be in , you know , at work and the kids are all ready in bed .
-- or chapel hill .
and working with all that .
-- about what 's going to happen .
they really were all there .
you know , on my platter .
you can see the house from , you know , miles away ,
ca- , a , a , a very great degree of that .
so , i took the ones from fifty-two on to the present ,
-- like their one last thing that they can still do ,
-- that , that ,
so like seventeen years with my kids .
as the people
we tried to , to , to ,
-- well , we are n't getting away from that , which is not right .
twenty or prime time live or something like that , you know , all , all of those shows , if i can do it ,
for that amount of people --
-- for it .
-- that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people .
cheap to pay the delivery .
weigh it or whatever
-- right , you know , hours after it happened
engineering and computers .
he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes .
you know , especially , i would say the receivers ,
-- which a lot of times everybody does n't need a p c ,
-- but , uh , a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you 're going to make at the job .
-- because i love billy crystal .
-- tole painting .
lasting punish- ,
because they were outside of the military sector .
-- and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
-- you hear about .
-- and hum it
-- and the question is , who are my sheep ,
sleep on the river on one of the , um , sand bars and then --
and dropped it for a long time when ,
like you say .
is not a real big movie goer ,
the thing that gets me is that while we 're supporting them ,
uh , somebody is on the premises
and bull dogs .
even though , you know , there 's not a prayer .
-- because , uh ,
ideas you know
and , uh ,
-- you know .
from him to use it .
-- early fifties ,
-- are spreading it .
-- i can do , you know , watching t v or whatever
that have very high percentages .
you know , need to ,
we do n't get channel two .
-- we try and do
you know ,
a young girl .
-- burned out .
-- before we moved to texas ,
-- so it 's got , to spin for very long ,
-- just , you know ,
we had done before .
i do n't think they are , because our , um , our measurements started in england ,
uh , depending on how my class schedule runs
one in tennessee , one in mississippi .
-- it was hard to treat her equally with my child .
and you could n't just , take up , take off and leave your group and go explore and , and things like that ,
all the time .
uh , in a pretty liberal family for , for that area at the time .
what do we pay , like eight and a half percent ,
he 's at a dangerous point right now .
we moved her to the basement ,
e- , y- , everybody that 's in the music business is starting out at fifteen .
because my dad had very , um , nine to five type job ,
mumblex if , if , if ,
-- then , uh , uh , you know , just something light finger food sort of something or ,
-- and , and , uh , i 'm , i 'm really gung ho for it .
-- and also for their business .
-- i have an old car which i doubt would , uh , would , uh , pass the inspection , a seventy-six ,
and playing all day .
-- you know , the pots will , will die ,
-- scattered ?
-- with , uh , with our kids .
trying to get out of that situation .
-- from ski associations and things , uh , at , during the year .
-- because i really do n't like the helman 's mayonnaise .
forever or when they get out they 're , you know , it 's a matter of a few months
areas ,
a lot of times you can get by using those for , uh , uh ,
and like , uh , community country club type things .
-- um , because , uh , you know this is a big football territory down here .
-- which got people really going into it ,
talked to my brother in three years . ''
a sylvan learning center this year
-- credit , going in .
uh , it was awakenings with , uh , robin williams and , uh , peter deniro .
-- one of our main problems was ,
-- i guess we 'll ,
-- and the kid at that age , especially if they 're going into undergraduate , it seems like they think they know what they want .
where , uh , or , uh , uh , a a r p , which has a lot of members .
maybe other friends --
there seems to be a lot more women involved .
-- you know .
-- and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill .
and then bark and march around , you know ,
you know , out of the city by myself .
-- lookout for that .
and the cardboard pages .
to find out .
-- and two or three that we play outside .
before spring break .
and then a little bit at life expectancy , i guess ,
-- some older children , i , i 'm wondering , how did you handle that ,
on so many of the people .
-- he 's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years --
and , or , not , not a friend , a cousin , a cousin .
-- and have all sorts of weather .
-- really ,
-- in the future years ?
that she almost , she almost , just sounds like your father ,
-- type things .
-- is turned on at , at a certain time
when you turn ,
-- which required quite a bit of painting .
-- changes anywhere else .
that will happen .
-- you become attached to it .
and , and had a marvelous like two nights ,
-- screw or whatever to get things apart .
or take enough or --
that thirty days --
a pro at this .
kind of train your mind .
-- i enjoy it .
thing be to clean .
a lot of the , the taxes gets back to the members of the congress and everything all running for twenty years , rather than .
-- says well this is the nineties
desert shield , uh , situations .
-- seems to like it .
uh , uh , go away from me ,
-- or somewhere where , you know , they do n't take local , they do n't take out of state checks --
the girl on designing women .
-- do something .
-- society .
-- i thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds .
-- i , uh , i know that since i do work , i buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and , uh --
those things happen .
that ,
-- the paper .
you know , go ,
you know , pay these players so much money ,
and those types of things , that would at least in some ways , um , bridge the gap .
areas wanting out of it ,
word text processing ,
it in a million years to do it myself
they said , no telephone books .
to school in the morning and be home when the children or child ,
-- because at night if i sit down , i 'm doing something with the kids or --
heal the world , you know ,
or , or what 's going on .
is division one .
familiar foods that i know are successful .
-- boating ?
and , uh , never really did well in english
-- i guess you 've got to look at something like that .
in school .
to them .
-- other than , uh , for , for , like people who dislike mumblex have some sort of crazed --
-- usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody .
-- you start --
degree , it 's , of course , it 's a whole lot easier .
you know , you , the lid pops off ,
-- using the computer ,
education of the people is primary , i would think .
which was really over priced .
-- the old apple , uh , the , the original apple had , what , yeah , forty-eight i guess , did n't it .
-- reporting .
-- say less advantaged areas .
-- tends to kind of come loose at the edges .
barbecue ,
-- are down there .
-- right out the window .
being ,
shorts for me and things for the summer .
-- we did n't do all these running .
child
i guess the job that i 'm in it 's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule .
-- and providing ,
make that actually happen ?
before they were used up
with the one and , and wish she could spend more time with her kids
a very , it was a poignant humor
-- elect do .
beyond that , you could work out on your own if you want .
just the retention of the material for them .
is higher ,
from time to time out here , we have four different p b s channels that we can get on the cable .
anyway .
-- year and a half training , you know , it 's , it 's something , you know ,
which brings us back to the idea , you know , someone 's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these --
-- they are , if you get a big cabin cruiser or --
-- kitchens , and things like that .
-- too many ,
-- important thing as , as having a career
-- it 's , you know , it 's almost too late to start ,
-- i 'm really into that ,
that really is .
i really agree with you .
-- get out or anything .
for a lot of people it is very personal .
you still have the , uh , more drug problems and typical ,
um , oh , oh , um , before the message really takes hold sometimes .
-- that action part is fantastic .
-- to age , to age the material
-- uh , you know , you got some cartoons
-- makers when you do that .
we 've really been enjoying those , uh , meals .
uh .
-- or how do you work that ?
-- it 's something like that .
that recycles everything imaginable
that are used ,
show them all the , all the pretties before they go away .
like that .
uh , constancy .
started out all men and then in the nineteenth century , began to have women .
which had a , you know , capital case in it .
channel eight when they came here thirteen , fourteen years ago , dave fox and tracy rowlett came together ,
that they had to put in
-- enjoy , and that they can get some benefits out of .
like a voice command --
to , to you know , you know ,
-- it 's just a lawn .
you know , few days .
then picked it up again later on
how did you get all this stuff ?
-- you know , i just feel entitled to it
and flower beds or even gardens , that , we 're just saying , let 's get some grass .
-- that anymore ,
ma , make them all .
-- because i consider that a drug .
and are now , now that even though california has reinstated the death penalty , for whatever various crimes .
-- together .
-- you know , and , and if you 've got , uh , food containers or anything like that , it 's a big problem .
work experience mumblex .
if you treat them right , they 're not the gas guzzlers i think that they 've got the reputation to be .
-- no painting to have to do .
-- other thing i would use .
-- at a men 's clothing store , or something , or sporting goods store ,
-- very much .
-- yeah , was ,
uh , you know , teaching classes --
they 're uh browned on all all sides
-- wear for other things .
i do n't know .
from my perspective now i can see that it 's a lot better than what we have now .
know their secrets
-- you know , for mothers not , not to be home , and yet , you know , um ,
you know , the higher echelon .
-- there 's different rewards , you know , different kinds of rewards .
to give it kind of a country look .
bytes left
-- that 's nice .
they 're working .
but there 's so many more people ,
-- we 've gotten ,
-- just so that the cooking goes a little faster .
of tire , get tir , tired of every other song being alabama on the ,
you know , this kind of stuff .
you have two cars the same ,
a person 's heart can be changed ,
they were very helpful
-- for very expensive clothes , very expensive jewelry --
-- people .
could do anything with cakes
milwaukee , did it ?
i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ra- ,
-- from listening to that , i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good with
-- you know , because , i mean , the general values that we 're teaching --
-- could tell us .
-- if purchasing things mail order ,
a kid around or something .
it 's so and such days from such and such date --
-- you know , how to judge it .
-- here , here on campus ,
with them ,
on your --
-- continued that far .
-- being a , managing and , yeah , you know , being a coach , i 'm sure .
the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before
-- are under a , a medical monitoring program ,
-- and , you know , global warming and all this other kind of stuff .
-- to do that .
-- i do n't think anymore .
-- i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration .
-- their kids getting , huh .
father is .
-- until she went to work last year in august
-- i ,
-- things like that .
-- w- , whether , you know , uh , whether you 're christian or jewish --
-- as opposed to , uh , mandatory .
-- and of course hay fever season --
-- that 's primarily why i have it right now .
-- that would make a big difference .
-- in central park ,
-- especially when it gets pretty cold .
-- making sure that , uh , that water is safe , and some of these things .
uh , were , you know , mom was like , um , mrs cleaver , uh , you know , june cleaver or whatever ,
central america .
and put it on a table or chair or something , she 'll knock it over ,
you know , i 've got all these clothes that i never wear ,
the peninsula ,
will be plenty for you .
-- because you 've got such a mixed bag there .
every sunday night .
-- like just out of college .
you know , in the long term effects of the , of the war
uh , apartment rent ,
-- and things like that .
and the seat belts
you know , there 's not a whole lot .
-- do n't have to pay social security tax .
although i think it could turn out really nice .
-- little ones at the table .
-- a little nervous that , uh , students do n't seem to show that respect
on the wes , east coast .
just stinks .
twenty odd years later .
-- not able to --
involving a violent crime or anything .
-- at a hundred dollars each . uh ,
-- person .
-- which just pleased me to death --
-- that eats even more .
-- nearly everything is in the pump squirt ,
of sorts ,
started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off , that it was the national ,
i would think .
-- to , so that they know that , uh , you know , male and female are both responsible for doing this --
-- of walnut hill and preston .
and then a daughter that 's thirteen .
how would you go about changing it ?
-- years ago .
-- it 's supported with facts though .
you know , and support the soldiers ,
and all they did is run and hide .
-- in pounds .
-- in snowbird and solitude and --
by the time i get home i 'm so tired it 's hard to cook a full meal .
-- went up dr- , drastically .
-- open as it should be .
not that i smoke , but cigarettes , um , uh , stamps ,
-- a potato and salad and soup , and the whole , whole nine yards ,
fossil fuels are the answer .
to really be camping .
now , you know , it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in miami beach somewhere .
uh , r- ,
luckily .
i had okra ,
-- uh , what they call survey work .
they 're young . uh , that , in my work place , who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman , uh , eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child ,
than my , uh , like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to .
schedule a under , uh ,
right .
you know ,
costs and other factors justify , uh , uh , executing people .
-- that 's my fav , that 's my favorite
-- ideas out for my own house and yard and stuff .
-- we always have .
uh , it , it really is worth while to sew .
-- run and operated --
you , uh , like best .
and along are these fast food restaurants .
and here it 's , uh , well it 's right by the ocean ,
-- fun .
-- what i mean by semi-pro .
with him in there .
-- do we agree , or unless it 's not me .
-- which he started watching
i know that , like in ,
-- but to keep the guy that 's illegal from getting his hands on one .
you know ,
-- because i know , you know , something about the other guy
we really do .
-- with a bunch of red splotches all across it .
-- believe that his , uh , the work competency of , of the employ- , employee is , is hurting the business .
are they going to go there ,
were at the saudi border .
is in both band and scouts too .
-- i had , wound up having to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of , you know , no , no insurance policy happened to cover it , which is ,
-- the news and , and everything .
when you get into trouble like that in a place like vietnam , you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into ,
-- and stuff for an organization he was in .
that are nostalgic .
the training for only a certain amount .
a month --
i do n't use any poison either .
i know .
and because until they put it in writing , i could n't get my insurance benefits
-- i think jordan and the , and the bulls have to be , uh , considered the likely favorites .
-- scheduling and --
as long as they have no annual membership fee ,
it was , it was a pleasant time .
-- wait for someone else .
i 'm selling , uh , telephone systems .
-- and recipes , that kind of stuff .
feel like the home cooking places , are , are the healthiest meals .
-- pittsburgh .
drinking .
-- little boys do all of those things --
and not be scurrying around in the kitchen ,
-- done that in years ,
-- l b j and --
the stress , and the heat , the record heat ,
about the yearly fees .
you know
-- designed a space just the right size for the t v and then the , the v c r and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment .
-- at the end of tax season because --
-- i think right , right now while my husband and i do n't have any kids we 'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and ,
that we would go all the way to iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between jerusalem and , uh , israel and the middle east arab countries , and , and when we have , when we have a lot of problems , r- , r- , right in our own back door .
text books .
-- that 's fine .
-- kid who was like new in town .
-- they 're going to , that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto , you know ,
in their home or three or whatever .
ridiculous and terrible just
and then from the parents ' side , have the parents support the school . get involved .
politicians .
this way .
that we get from t i .
by a false test ,
uh , a- , as a repayment for ,
-- they 're , they 're , they 're , you know , they 're sort of in , in good standing , whereas , you know , um , i think , i certainly do n't think they 're the eighty-six team any more .
it just makes your skin more leathery .
it does n't .
-- all rest ,
-- a few more cents onto the price of gasoline .
-- or sometimes a roast ,
-- and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts .
-- pitching staff .
-- now 's she 's graduated to two cheeseburgers ,
uh , because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone .
i could possibly do it
you know , what might happen .
to keep it , to keep it b- , from becoming even more obnoxious .
and and everything .
that can happen .
little bit mumblex and little here and there
find out when they 're performing ,
of newspapers .
-- you know , for every part of your body .
because they 're horning in on somebody else 's territory .
-- make the transaction over the telephone ,
-- do n't really care to go out and visit as much .
-- there 's nothing to hold them there in college station since they 're retired .
-- or some priorities anyway .
half the price of a mouse ,
they 're kind of convenient .
and , uh , stayed about three or four days in there .
-- certainly a , a supplemental way , uh ,
because they would turn on th- , on their handlers .
-- great out country really is .
-- annual fees or i 'll just go to somewhere else .
-- left a fitting loose , or --
say , call me before you leave and --
which is computer , you know ,
-- the witnesses ?
-- where , where there 's a vengeful lord in the old testament and there 's a loving lord in the new testament .
-- and so forth it 's , wh- ,
-- everything else ,
uh , that really paid off .
-- good old books and classics ,
i will put it away ,
-- just to press buttons , and .
and the money magazines .
-- sounds great .
you can get , you know , two thousand a year , you know , or more .
it is with your house .
-- unanimous .
-- hurricanes and stuff ,
any other group that , that has a stake in something .
-- lake murray --
what are you , crazy , we ca n't understand you .
uh , there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful .
i sing
and , uh , a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it .
-- is a hundred sixty .
-- amarillo , dumas , panhandle .
-- was killed --
-- feeling about .
-- one thing they do n't do is , is drug testing while you 're on the job .
-- uh , i , embarrassed to say , it 's pretty trivial .
what type , what type of business takes you to those climates
alive .
uh , right .
-- things to a car themselves .
but yet still be with his peers --
and we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to , because i bet , they still say our system is the best in the world .
i watched all three games of that .
-- drank a beer , watched the game , had a gir- , a good time that way .
terrible .
you know , go to a store , they normally have these exercise , things , these a b c -s of physical fitness on them .
and w- , i- , i- , what 's the word i 'm looking for .
-- we pretty much have , you know , the house payment ,
-- um , you know ,
in trade for ,
-- you know .
in his early movies .
that , you think this is n't sinking in .
so that 's ,
-- just by yourself .
-- an awful lot of things ,
-- right about now .
-- without , you know , just telling them , running their country for them
she thought they were brand new ,
-- come down on friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend ,
they , um , um ,
-- you know ,
mumblex but this is from hong kong ,
salad ?
-- on , on clothing and stuff , uh , i know .
-- one of the big concerns is they have a , there 's a school right across the highway from the landfill .
-- leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that , uh , private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a --
-- you know ,
-- uh , the steady paychecks that come .
bad you can see where those spackling marks were .
or two years or something like that ,
-- real well .
seems they handle better .
i do n't know when i 'm going to get to them all .
-- teach in california ?
with your time when you get into it .
and like that .
-- that 's always fun .
at the same time .
-- it 's frightening .
whether it would be going to ,
-- tend to ignore places outside of the county .
and how about the person in , uh , houston ?
it does seem like it .
-- uh , where the rangers played .
-- they wo n't let them hire any new ones
and , uh , has , uh , like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out ,
something on that order .
uh , was basic , in a , you know , middle , upper middle class area ,
think we ought to , you know ,
and are real smart and decided , hey , i want to make a lot of money ,
buys their own flag and and burns it that 's fine
called . gondolas .
you would n't do it yourself .
and get through that birthday party .
-- or whatever , uh ,
-- and so much more comfortable --
-- and , and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand --
-- in the time and , and with the expense and everything ,
pay ,
-- to tell you the truth .
because all the peer pressure ,
will be shot or something like that , you know .
-- i 'm just going to ignore it .
-- point things ,
the company doing the wrong .
-- you know , or five .
gone through that , uh ,
-- five year terms or whatever .
looking at gray walls . you know ,
and t-shirts .
you know ,
-- your own college .
-- he tracks her down .
-- doing that public service would be great .
to use it .
-- what , uh , we watch .
there was only like two or three .
or fourteen or , and , and , especially some of the minority children . whether ,
-- cheesecakes .
from one of , somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about .
-- and just cover it with some , uh , waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done ,
-- long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help , and even though we were both working the same number of hours , and , and doing things , i had to come in there specifically and say --
-- from that point on , i became so anti drunk driving --
-- on that , because it 's not ,
uh-huh .
that are automatic or semiautomatic ?
and then say , man this is really good ,
we- , i think ,
-- uh , it was , uh , well , let 's see , it was municipal court --
and , uh , had , uh , the pleasure of their good mexican ,
-- bigger purchase or something .
-- but , i 've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby ,
i 'm getting on to it ,
-- um , i just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and ,
-- s- , s- , smell and everything ,
-- including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal .
-- or things like that .
-- that keeps you busy .
properly .
-- and she can look at it that way and , and , uh , that 's ...
-- or like the news , because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports , you know , is your kid 's bus driver smoking crack ,
-- uh , because they were a democracy turned , uh --
-- having a household try it .
as far as , uh , people dropping out of school , uh , grades on test scores being low , uh , more and more people taking g e d -s trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school .
agree with that .
make the car more expensive , but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong .
-- for the winter .
-- is the answer ,
-- and all that .
-- as soon as that occurred , we simply said that , uh , instead of the , uh , hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country , we cut that by , uh , two thirds .
much less for criminals that should be indicted .
-- in a nursing home ,
-- to grow .
it 's kind of fun ,
uh , we had ice and snow , uh , uh ,
stuff like that .
-- that had the heat wave .
to be a lot of fun .
i 'm not sure , uh ,
-- and see exactly what 's happening .
when we , when we se- , get serious about cleaning , about our motors in our automobiles then , uh , then maybe , you know , we 'll have a little bit of help . um , uh ,
-- come from , uh , like georgia or --
i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen k on them , is all ,
uh-huh .
in her home .
-- you know , all the time he was growing up --
it , it cost me , you know , twenty bucks , easy .
-- doing stuff .
you just start hearing more and more .
college .
-- of these things ,
you know .
huge for me ,
-- you know ,
-- where , especially in a kenyon or a williams , where you see the professors around town all the time , you skip class in the morning and they see you ,
there might be .
ju- ,
-- or a , uh , you know , somewhere close --
-- and , to lewisville --
-- so it 's just been painting , yeah ,
-- this happened or that happened
-- like that .
-- of problem .
uh , extraordinary things on t v ,
because of all the computers and stuff .
newspaper through her .
yeah ,
-- there 's always more things to do .
uh , much beyond that i do n't do .
you know ?
-- and then they came in .
-- very enjoyable gardens ,
-- because , uh , i lived in oakland --
or junior ?
-- into my account
-- or chopped onions if you want to do that , you know . what ever , however much effort you feel like putting into it .
april twentieth ,
set back in the woods ?
-- just , there is n't any particular music that i enjoy more than just listening to all kinds --
-- has been ,
my brother had trouble with fire ants , and that even .
-- the federal one 's the big one .
a , a lot at , at the stores , a- , a- , at record stores ,
nobody knows about it ,
-- unless there 's some big article in there that you 're going to keep for your kids ,
if you sentence them to three life times , then they probably wo n't get out on parole .
-- but , is not engaged yet ,
to you about exercise and fitness .
do n't really care for today 's rock and roll too much .
-- than you 're going to get out of private individuals ,
-- they should be happy naturally ,
yeah ,
-- well , uh , see if there is anything in there that , uh , uh , would be s- , positive , you know .
-- when they do that .
-- of , uh , people to teach math and sciences .
more than two years ago , i guarantee ,
it , it was n't , uh , it was n't conditions to being out in it
because we went out the ventura highway to thousand oaks and on up --
keep it and maybe consider getting a , a better one for me . uh ,
or say driving trucks or buses , city buses or something like that .
-- uh , i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
how to find water
that approach .
-- and using up all my nighttimes ,
-- from surrounding , you know , areas and that .
and feeling of safety .
mumblex keep them , yeah , keep them clean
and the examiner ,
eventually the , you will , you will be doing lots of stuff .
-- than , than drugs , so to speak .
and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service .
that came out of it , good or bad ,
of mine told me about this program , is the reason that i 'm ,
they 've been recycling cans --
it just makes it very pliable and ,
-- i guess .
and pro football ,
-- once upon a time .
bigger than anything that they 've --
that was made .
-- just terrible .
uh , does computer modeling .
an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use .
that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose , you know , if , if you 're going to hunt with it ,
-- and your physical being --
student there and spent , um , a semester studying abroad in london .
practically has to be blasted in i guess .
-- too bad .
for the difference in the exchange rate .
-- does that tell you ?
tell you how long , until she got , uh , where she had to have complete care ,
-- then that 's another forty bucks , plus whatever else he decides to do to you ,
so that then i could take the van ,
-- losing all my fish .
that ,
so , uh ,
that everybody likes , you know ,
the hardest thing i 've ever done , as much as you 'd go out
it 's just easier to put everything on a card .
-- michigan
-- for the day and eating breakfast .
started working .
-- of meals and that kind of thing ,
-- change .
-- what , what problems my children might have in that , uh ,
-- to get better schools .
-- and , you know , mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden ,
-- uh , then there must be , it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people .
it ,
and , uh , swapped them a cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring i would build a house some day , you know .
time .
just about , all by the porch .
uh , automatically
nice talking to you .
and so , it was , it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie .
you know , being a non-american you want to see what a baseball game is like .
-- which is not very many .
-- and do the whole thing ,
in a couple of minutes .
over huge areas ,
-- well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that .
i really feel very strong about the bart simpson show .
-- versus something up here we can live without it
it did n't matter .
-- last year .
uh , refuse .
you know , again .
go down south , country music and ,
-- out of my payroll .
it --
it was a similar , uh , situation with the iroquois indians attacking a , an army fort .
-- seeing the cover .
-- everything like that ,
or how many were ,
taking , taking one more life does n't , does n't , does n't re- , get things back the way they were , right .
and , and older people .
-- which are in bayfield which is a wonderful place .
was more than a full-time job .
-- liter bottles , et cetera , et cetera .
-- uh , from their employer and friends and family and things
-- the , the public themselves get health insurance
twin cities area .
-- um , out and about
you know .
uh , or maybe just because , you know , there 's , there 's a lot more flat lands , you know , out in the west .
because depending on who your guests are .
concerned about their inability that to , that their vote does not count any way .
because he said with the rocks --
at , at this point .
that 's why i guess , everybody ,
it 's really ,
worth it .
because they 're used to not having public transportation .
and , uh , i- , reinstalled that
you know , that that happened .
-- and years on appeals .
i guess the interior would have to be black leather
the sitcoms .
-- that was similar to that .
until she was okay .
take your , the children
and the , the new chevy lumina van ,
-- and , when i used to live there ,
-- in the , uh .
which is probably closest to gold that you can get .
-- of a sudden too .
-- if they , if they 're , especially if there 's they 're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where , you know , if they can , if they made a mistake , it would cost a lot of money or --
-- of hispanic heritage .
-- i found in , um , in traveling overseas --
-- of days .
you know ,
you know , you 'd go and sleep at night time .
given
-- and a pantsuit of one sort or another
and perha- , perhaps i 'll call you back and let you know what , how the australian system works .
-- in central california --
the first grade level , which would be ,
-- so when she gets home she likes to mow .
volunteer to help clean up the streets .
with the smaller car .
-- and , and a- , also , they have the , uh , the , uh , uh , parliament 's question and answer period .
and you combine your dry ingredients
i 'm driving tomor- , i 'm , i 'm driving home tomorrow , so ,
-- you know , so whatever , you know , they would do , we 'd go along with --
i really do n't have anything to compare it to .
-- just she wants the --
i keep thinking that there 's got to be some way , that , that a lot of this is circumstances .
-- before then .
uh , can her makeup come off the upholstery .
my guests , i guess ,
which actually happened .
-- such for b m w .
-- we may see more slapstick .
mumblex got them .
you 're required to wear them .
-- or early in the morning . uh ,
-- the , the risk is almost not there .
-- get out of the rain .
on to the next one ,
as well ,
-- the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was , somebody has , uh , ter- , made some special , uh , polymers that have the ability to , uh , make certain actinide elements adhere to them .
there 's usually , yeah , there 's usually something going on that , that , uh , and would , would , uh , cause that to happen --
thing that changed that was the manual typewriter .
-- and then the people default --
or six weeks ,
have a , you , a good appetite .
uh , it 's , it 's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and do n't think about it when the election time arises .
-- than i had to pay for all of my school taxes .
to let them go play with someone and --
-- exposure to different groups and everything .
or category .
-- and he was there to paint the french doors also .
-- you know ,
-- where you work .
that 's something i like to do and , uh , something i , something i can do with now the sophisticated auto ,
uh , it 's not a very good idea .
-- because you have to meet their schedules as well ,
every three to five days that i work overtime there ,
can make a difference
and , uh , work on his christmas stocking .
after all this time .
-- we , we still feel very new ,
things that have to get ironed ,
-- it just gets pretty expensive .
-- this needs to be done ,
-- abortion , or something where there 's an , an no or yes side ,
-- just based on that , not including --
-- i have a boyfriend that lives in fresno
-- to learn how to paint them right , you know .
that come
so , you know ,
-- charity that 's put it together .
-- foods would you have ?
and it gets into , into people ,
-- is one , is an hour 's program that i always ,
-- thousands of people on --
-- then snuff them .
responded to , uh , the dir- , the , uh , parties that are involved , and if enough ,
i do n't know , it ju- , just seems too much of the money is just lost .
you know , in case you ever need to bail out .
-- course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush .
-- has , uh , you know , on the order of twice as many students as --
-- helps a lot .
-- commit your child to them .
-- zero lot home ,
and , a few lures ,
-- they 've got trillions of dollars to spend every year ,
people have the , generally the same view .
-- of what kind of insurance policy they , what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take .
that was wonderful .
uh , we both enjoy mushroom soup
-- too ,
and apartment market for a while .
-- engineer ?
one of these twelve by forty-eight 's that got repoed ,
they seem to be put together a little bit better .
-- in front of them ,
-- that lived in with you ?
-- what i wear depends on the weather .
-- even though baylor , uh ,
and , um , although i do n't have too serious a problem ,
uh , uh , greek gods and , and greek , uh , mythology --
just mainly to melt the cheese and everything , and let all the seasoning melt into it .
from whom .
-- i , i agree wholeheartedly .
so if there was ever a mistake , i could easily check , you know ,
like on thursday nights at nine o'clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch , uh , knots landing .
the , the significant thing is , is today did , did you , uh , did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf ?
garlic bread ,
exactly ,
what a , a week , i think we here at t i get a total of eleven a year .
it does n't give you relaxation ,
-- you know , what they 're , what they 'd been guilty of , and a lot of different things , i guess .
-- and has , um , paneling in the living room , and lots of , lots of tans and lots of browns --
-- plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty-three percent --
that 's pretty weird .
-- actively looking into that .
because a lot of them are similar .
they 're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece .
i had those for my kids
flimsy
spare time .
-- of computer reading
especially for certain jobs .
-- after i have got home and after dinner
-- for awhile .
they do , they watch it .
so it 's ,
makes a colorful salad too .
you know , two point two pounds or something . i think people will start getting a sense of , gee the metric is the sensible one .
which we 've had a lot of ,
uh , you know , just the , really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and --
-- and professions .
-- they 've been laying off a lot of people .
-- uh , as long as the hardware store told me what to buy , then i could do it .
in durham , which is right next to raleigh .
-- really bad one ,
-- certainly have the technology ,
-- uh , most of them do n't ever want to go back to mexico ,
and why you would advise them .
-- there 's nobody there .
virtually every time .
-- more than onc- , --
uh , uh , i ca n't understand why anyone would abandon this dog , though .
-- on our bin --
i 'm spring creek .
-- uh , a friend of mine from denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child .
we have books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different , uh , commercial and academic publishers and university presses .
-- that will probably help out .
-- had one gun
in debt .
-- unless you 've got something else , well ,
birds with the , the orange crest on top .
-- than a magazine .
and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to , you know deal with the consequences ,
-- and galunkies and all that .
of that group .
well , not lately .
uh , actually no .
not really .
uh , no she passed away .
we ,
they go camping on their own .
texas is not one of them see .
well , not necessarily in dallas ,
i do n't think so .
never .
um , not really just yet .
not really .
um , e- , n- ,
i have n't ,
actually , i prefer my , my performers to be pretty sober , you know , just uh , just so that , you know , that if they 're jamming , you know , that they do n't just lose themselves and you know , go into lala land .
uh , not ,
not that i know of .
um , probably not .
not originally .
i really do n't watch that much t v ,
probably not ,
i 've never heard of that .
i do n't ,
um , i do n't think i ever tried .
well , ourselves , we have , i guess never had to look for child care .
oh , not right now .
as far as i can tell it has n't killed anything it was n't supposed to .
well , that 's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis .

yeah ,
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
yes ,
yeah .
oh , yeah
yes .
yeah .
yeah ,
you know , i do n't know your feelings toward that .
how long have you had them .
whoever troy aikman is .
and , uh , i just wondering how i go about getting the cash .
but , uh , well , what was that show , um , gar- , uh , garf- ,
uh , i do not know how you were historically .
i mean wha , what part of town . in here in denison .
i 'm not sure where you 're from .
i imagine it 's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather .
despite the fact that your number is unlisted ?
i assume so .
you know what i 'm saying ?
i do n't know if you 're a ta- , a radio talk , uh , person listener .
and , uh , you know how they are at that age , i guess .
-- so you , you , you probably go everywhere --
a lot of leaves to rake up too , i bet .
you probably heard about that .
so --
-- then you broke your heart .
so you probably would n't recommend that as a big tourist spot ?
in terms of what they 're talking about .
oh , boy , i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it .
now this is a lebaron ?
until you release it .
and found it right away .
so you have to do the random drug testing .
oh , i bet that 's pretty .
there 's no official document signed or anything ?
so you ca n't use oil on wood ?
you may be familiar with cooperative learning .
you do n't have children ?
you , you would be in favor of it ?
so you ha ,
someone had to figure out what was going on ?
i 'm not just going to ,
all local .
hurling .
i do n't know if you all have those things around .
so in , in your area then there 's probably a lot of , um , career type people that have those type homes
but they do n't give you for the other .
and that 's how you got involved .
did we ,
and i do n't know if you 've heard of plano
where you live now ,
being born outside , you did n't have any problems house training him ?
you never saw that ?
no cracked slab or anything like that ?
she just recently started working then .
that would mean they all would have to decide --
invisible man by ralph ellison .
i do n't know ,
because after , i guess after he , you know , gets to a certain age she 's going to have to take him to a day care .
like an attachment
so you guys can actually get ahead .
so you have a break too .
course you 're familiar with the t i drawing , well , with any drawing system --
you want to go back to that , uh ,
-- and i guess you are .
you just , they buy them from you ,
and get that done this summer ?
wow , in high school ?
oh , you do n't .
but i 'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high .
have you worked mostly on i b m ,
oh --
buying a car is , uh , something you 're contemplating , i take it .
so you live in garland then .
so i imagine they use personal computers .
you know , basically the size of , uh , the area around richardson ?
is that the one set in the fifties , or sixties .
and then you stopped them all .
and , and you 're staying within your budget and keep ,
and this is a club
i do n't know if you saw ghosts or not .
i , uh , i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that ,
and i guess we have to ,
not really .
but you do n't play any other sports but basketball ?
they 're not moving very well .
the blowers ?
and things begin to collapse
she 's old .
and , and you said about plano and campbell is the petting ,
you have one that often .
so , so you just , you have one floor all to yourself ?
i do n't know if your on city water ,
oh , yeah ?
did you .
i do n't know what it 's , uh , by you .
in plano ?
remember the last two freezes ,
you cook them so often you kind of forget their names .
oh , you 're ready to move on to bi- ,
you must , uh , work for t i ?
you all have much trouble up there , with insects
but so , you like food
keep it there .
i mean , it 's that , it 's that kind of like --
well , you 're still , uh , get- , you 're just trying to get over the culture shock still .
i mean , you , you must back up and play some of the music twice .
show off a little bit .
-- and it 's filled with what , whip cream --
it would be cheaper to move that than buy another one .
so , that 's probably a pretty nice place to go .
a jar or something
i wonder where they dump that .
you live in virginia , now ?
but you , you , you nonetheless often get , get people calling you ?
only , only the big time schools show that .
you do n't think that 's strange looking .
you must feel real good about that .
it was an l x ?
so . i do n't know if you participate in that or not ,
you , maybe you buy that , you know ,
so , so i guess our vote is no .
it was just pot luck .
they do n't even try to keep up with it .
marcos --
you 're kidding .
then that 's , uh , kind of a private organization ,
so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else .
so you said that you live in coppell .
i take it she was an accountant .
uh , for a car ?
the military version , attack weapons ,
i mean suppose they found out some other way ?
oh , i bet you 're glad .
i suppose they are now .
well , in a way it is ,
it may not be ,
well supporting the kurds
i may ,
well i , i , i think overall that 's right .
i do n't know .
ok , you 're you 're that 's fine up to there except that uh , th- what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country ,
well , it sort of is .
something like that ,
probably .
go over there and rebuild all those .
that you ca n't , you ca n't remove the jury regardless of the case .
uh , got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture
well , that 's , that was kind of the , the aim was n't it , to get it started and then have it ,
so you 're , you 're with the home office now .
nevertheless you maintain that it 's it is the right of of any citizen
large classes .
so that was it .
i mean , you figure there 's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child .
you were helping your parents .
to report it ,
get a real job , full time .
a train of cats running around .
you have a lot good experiences from that .
so , in other words , that 's the way they force --
so , you did n't really grow up with that kind of music then .
way up north here , huh .
the mountains ,
and that is it 's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of ,
que- , you , you 're talking queen ,
sounds like you have a little one there .
just something i have to do everyday .
presentation
they need some attention .
she 's out ,
oh , so you 're from the midwest , too .
like you said , i do n't know how much , how much they 're taking from the work force , you know .
you mean somebody that has an actual establishment .
that 'll cover your gifts come christmas time .
wastes your future .
those machine guns and all that .
so , they 're actually commissioned performances .
that , that , that counts .
so that 's perfect .
you have to learn how to do it .
and they were n't .
that much land requires an awful lot of time .
all the checks ,
well , that sounds like you all really have a , a great system worked out there .
so you travel a lot .
that , uh , the , what they call the latchkey children .
so you wo n't get ,
so it 's really up north in the country , really , mumblex .
probably the pacific breezes make a lot of difference ,
it was n't so he- ,
sounds like he , that you were right .
when they 're young ,
magic time machine is the place you 're thinking of ,
you do n't know if their complaints are legitimate .
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers .
oh , and you just do n't have any yet ,
right down there .
different kinds of voices and things .
you figure ,
oh , you do a lot then .
so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a --
you , you were talking about , uh , uh , --
pretty low .
compile more statistics .
so , communications , huh .
so what you 're --
oh , so you do n't wear heels anymore i 'll bet .
she got you a mumblex .
-- unless an employer has a reason to --
you mean the clocks .
they knew , they knew the extras or the ,
somebody that does n't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it .
uh , natural disease ,
it 's a package deal .
they do n't report on every murder and shooting that happened in , in every little town .
so he 's ,
so they 'll actually fit in the canoe
i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools .
oh , that one .
the , uh , the supports .
they are tough
so it does n't get , uh , uh , the credit , uh ,
well , it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic .
that would be premeditated .
he works for t i .
oh , you went to the dollar movie ?
it 's not a big , you know --
what , what you use and , and --
oh with w p a .
because you 'd probably be , uh , too puritanical
to use you mean ,
vacation home .
just smelling the air .
so the convenience ,
changing people 's expectations .
it 's not ,
especially to pay that kind of money for it .
like apple pie in america ,
oh . thank you very much .

oh do they really ?
so have ,
does your son work for t i ?
are you looking
and did you ever eat at the blue bin diner ?
i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening , you 've still got a couple months to go , have n't you ?
and would you , uh , would it be appropriate to , uh , drink with the , uh , prior , when you have the hors d'oeuvres ?
does that help ? .
i do n't think they 've ever made a movie , do you ?
well , uh , i know one thin- , i , i think texas has the death penalty , right ?
well , well , speaking of that kind of issue , have you kept up with john wiley price ?
do you know ?
well , i personally do n't have any problem with , uh , drug testing employees or potential employees , do you ?
do you think most states have that
do , do you have kids you take to movies
ye- , everybody does , right .
you 've never been down to epcot at florida and disney --
but do you feel though , uh , craftsmanship is much superior to the american abilities ?
i forgot to ask you , did the iguana catch flies for you ?
he did n't have a license for the gun , correct ?
uh , have you seen pretty woman ?
is that how it 's worded ?
did you ever see , um , um , sleeping with the enemy ?
you , you got the topic , right ?

have you seen that by bly ?
what is , uh , is a marsala wine a sweeter wine ?

they are good , usually good are n't they ?
do you want to start ?
did they find who killed him ?
do you own a computer ?
to commute to work ?
now do you think that 's because they 've realized that for whole health , that , the , you know , you have to have that combination , or that people are motivated that way so that they 've incorporated that into their program .
where there 's a will ,
because is n't it pretty much everywhere in the world ?
well , did you see carl sagan on sixty minutes on , uh , when he was talking about when if , if the , if the war started in , in kuwait and they 'd set those , uh , all th- ,
do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a state basis or u s government basis ?
do n't you wish you had been able to , though ?
so you make it , uh , to that longhorns sooners game ?
or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing .
like , like are you talking about movies like die hard two .

i mean , did a couple of people sort of gradually , sort of assume , uh , sort of a moderator role in the trial
and colorado springs ?
do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program

it 's usually dry down there , is n't it ?
is that correct ?
and you , you know ,
do you ?
uh , where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ?
but is n't that , is n't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and hispanics and other minorities just do n't vote ?
so , i do n't know what the answer is .
but , uh , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
mumblex but , um , i do n't know
i do n't know
i do n't know .
i ca n't remember .
but , uh , i do n't know .
but , i do n't know ,
and , uh , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
but , i , i do n't know .
so --
but , uh , i do n't know ,
so , i do n't know .
well , i do n't know ,
but i do n't know .
and , uh , i do n't know ,
at least that was some of the rumors .
and i do n't know .
but i do n't know what the , the laws ,
i do n't know .
so , but , uh , you know , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
and i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
boy , i ca n't remember .
well , i do n't know ,
i do n't --
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
but ,
i do n't know , uh , if this would be helpful .
you know , but , i do n't know .
i 'm not too sure ,
we 'll just see .
because you never know ,
uh , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
i mean , not bothered me ,
. well , um , i do n't know ,
so , i do n't know ,
i do n't know , anymore .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
and i do n't , i do n't know .
i do n't know .
well , i do n't know , you know .
i do n't know .
and then , um , i do n't know
that 's hard to say .
but , uh , i do n't know ,
i do n't know , uh ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know .
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
and , uh , i do n't know ,
i do n't know .
i , i do n't know .
i do n't know , you know ,
i do n't know .
-- and i 'm not really sure how i feel about that .
you know , i mean , but , i do n't know .
i do n't know ,
well i do n't know .
so , i do n't know .
but , uh , i do n't know .
i do n't remember .
it really is .
i do n't know ,
well , i do n't know ,
i 'm not sure ,
well , i should n't say all of them ,
i do not think it 's done by , uh ,
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
so , i do n't know .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
maybe not .
oh , i would n't know ,
i guess .
uh , but now that 's just what they said .
so i do n't know ,
i do n't know .
in a way you realize ,
i do n't know though .
i , i do not know how that 's ,
i , i do n't know .
and it may not be true in every place .
i do n't know
i do n't know ,
i do not know ,
i do n't know ,
and , uh , oh , i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
so i ,
um , i do n't know .
but , uh , um , i do n't know .
and , and i do n't know .
and , i do n't know ,
i do n't know about you .
i do n't know ,
uh , i do n't know .
i believe --
i do n't know .
and i do n't know ,
but , uh , i do n't know .
well , i should n't say the only time ,
i do n't know
but , uh , oh , i do n't know , uh ,
i do n't know ,
and maybe it 's just the t v show or movie i was watching ,
i do n't know ,
i do n't know ,
but it 's the best one in the world .
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers .
and that 's what all these , you know , court cases are about .
now , i agree with their right to , uh , pursue their religion of choice , in that , whatever manner they want to ,
i , i know that the amount of , or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has , has greatly changed .
-- uh , you can do that which is what i choose to do .
you do n't just have some local group do it .
i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see
that has broadened so much also .
that 's important too .
i mean , you got to wonder how long they 're going to keep doing that for .
uh , and , you know , it certainly does n't seem to be a deterrent . uh , for one thing because it 's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly do n't think the people that are committing the c- , crimes that would be eligible , you know , really care .
we , we buy from intimate international banking .
-- uh , they , they go after , well ,
i think they 'd come here trying to find a new market for their , their brand of crime .
but , that 's not going to work , uh ,
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling .
i think it was in a hispanic area ,
if the guys got some incentive ,
oh , that 's a lot of fun .
and , uh , once you kill off a few of them ,
you have to like kind of set yourself ,
those are nice .
combine that into one . and then from eighteen sixty-five to present ,
an , and while , while there are some advantages to that , there 's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things .
and you wish so badly that you could do them .
although , you know , stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole ,
so that looks good when you all get ready to sell , you 'll probably do really well .
i , if i did it every night --
there 's a big variation among the country ,
that makes a big difference .
but as for its being required --
but , um , they were always talking about the air quality of today is this , you know , the ozone or whatever ,
to me it 's really , um ,
but after awhile it will start , um , you know ,
you 're supposed to make lists of , uh , cars .
oh , i 'm sure it would .
and , and , in , incorporating , you know , reusable materials into your , uh , you know , your --
i think that 's part of the problem ,
it loses it somewhere .
not everybody enjoys it , though .
it seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like , you know , be ...
oh , you do n't sound like it .
because sometimes , uh , there 's times when you may , maybe could n't take advantage of something --
but , uh , as far as , uh , as their management goes , um , i 'm not sure they 're any , any better off than they were , were before management wise .
well , criminal or something like that 's different ,
they 'll make it , you know ,
and i do n't think that 's right .
that 's for sure .
so a lot of people just get out , you know , back on the streets because there 's no , they ca n't keep that many people in the buildings they have .
once they get up in sch- ,
i have this vague since that , that could happen that , that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost .
a lot of times they , they , they do it manually on the computer , which just really is a waste of time ,
the company 's more profitable ,
you know the fam- , --
and when , uh , difficult decisions , uh , are made , uh , uh , uh , they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on .
but it 's all the same to me .
like , they could put it in one of their children 's names or something --
oh , i think that ,
um , if , if an employee is especially exemplary , i think it 's often ,
but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind --
well , that 's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media , which takes a heck of a beating and , and deserves some of it , is telling us , you know , about the problems .
and seems to me like the peace corps ,
i , it 's hard to say .
i , i , i , i think , i think there 's a lot to be said for kids working --
everybody seems to be ,
but , uh ,
we , we have said that , i 've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea- , two terms is enough for all of them .
i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than , than what most people think of them as .
he does .
we , we 're getting into capital punishment now .
if they 'd been in day care the entire time and it was n't ,
it depends on --
the best philosophy is have them if you need them , but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere .
well , i think , i think , i , i mean what we 've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers --
so ,
because in the country , people still respect , uh , the property of other people .
and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
i think it 's like once a month ,
and i do n't think there 's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have .
it 's kind of interesting to , to , to talk up , you know , your ,
that would be the intent of it .
we 've got so much built up in , um , in the , in the , uh , bureaucracy and in the politics of it ,
the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor .
a term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even four terms
and , you know , i just find that incredible .
and it 's beautiful
in , in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot , i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem .
i mean , i think center day cares there 's so many people coming in and out --
they , uh , you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they 're all so serious , you know .
-- the american family does n't need any more pressure .
they shoot so much ,
i think now when both are working they have a more ch- , more of a chance of working together because they 're starting out that way .
and he would get the glory , though , no king , no ,
and it , it makes you more aware of what you 're eating .
so maybe that counts .
those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment .
when you have the knowledge , you 're you 're not going to , uh , you know , be let go ,
most of the time now it 's a necessity ,
otherwise they 're pretty smelly .
but you have to have a need .
some of those get very philosophical
it 's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just ,
so apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person the , you know , any felony anyways .
but they , they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories .
and , unfortunately , there 's not many places to get that money .
and now we say , gee , dallas really is big and polluted .
i mean , and , and , the expenses , you know , of the war , you know , it 's like , uh , it 's like who 's gaining on this .
it 's kind of a hassle when you have this ,
and it 's just that i think they 're just tieing up the , um , whole judicial process .
so she was going on those two instincts .
i guess --
they 've just gotten so huge ,
that 's , that 's real true .
in his , in the congress they , they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned , which is , gives him more power overall , which i think is a good sign that there will be some , you know ,
it 's really , it 's a hard balance . it , it definitely is .
and i feel like they sensationalize things that should n't be sensationalized .
unless you just want to skim through while you 're ,
but also some poodles , uh --
plus , by the time you get a baby-sitter , and then pay to go to the movies --
i guess we 're both lucky .
and we might be able to incorporate some of that .
it is n't ,
-- and , uh , whatever i get , i want to have , uh , air bags , uh , both driver 's and passenger side and four door because it 's much more convenient if you 're carrying anybody to , you know , rather than have them stoop down to get over ,
normally that would interfere with college , i would think .
so instead , we spend billions of dollars going to war .
they ,
they 'd have that respect for what it does ,
and um , you know , so we 're having problems in , in that way ,
it seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me .
well , uh , well here what they do and i , i contend that it 's certainly not the right thing to do , they spread salt .
you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff ,
or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted .
you 're not old at all .
-- and , uh , well , i , i think what 's happened , too , is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that , and there 's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up , aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day --
and you end up owing , you know ,
i 'm , i 'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it 's worth more to them than if you give it to them ,
uh , i think that , uh , really it would n't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service .
and , uh , and i think it kind of took that uh , neatness away from it , you know ,
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
and that 's not their problem .
and i bet if we trace back to their ,
and it 's legal in a situation like that .
well of course in the cities ,
because ,
but other than that , you really do n't know what 's going on .
and , and you 're , you 're lost .
you ,
and one thing , it 'll save us money , because we 've got the buildings sitting there ,
um , that was okay ,
well we 're getting off the subject , i guess ,
you know , maybe you lived too far away to care for them ,
and so , you know , they , they would just ,
and some of them do n't ,
it 's not so bad for the court system because the money there is n't being spent
it 's something they do n't tell you about when you 're growing up .
and if we do n't start making changes in the homes
but , by the same token some of these charges they make for well , minor endeavors , shall we say --
and they 'll try it again in a couple of years .
it 's , it 's a little different , because you see things from a different --
must have had some interesting , uh , assignments for you there .
it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again , you know ,
maybe he drinks
and , um , and i really think , i think i 'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school , because i think their parents pay more ,
that 's all you have time for .
there 's some people are living pretty , pretty good life styles ,
i think that 's probably a good thing .
well you do n't just get ready .
and nothing seems to change .
it 's phenomenal , the programming , the human operating system ,
but some of them , like , like , twenty-seven
we 're , we 're smarter now .
so . uh , it 's , i do n't know , an urban area , i guess
so that 's , that 's maybe not so typical ,
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things ,
at least it 's with one person --
but , uh , never the less it was fun to see those figures next to , you know ,
i 'd say it is wrong to mumblex
but the kids are basically doing what they want --
i think we need to get back to the , show some respect
i guess that 's the best way , you know , to get ,
and the barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff
must be a --
it 's been changing ,
or , or maybe that it 's not understood what should be covered and what is n't .
and , uh , i 'm not sure they know exactly what , uh , uh , public education supposed to be for anymore .
and you wait three months
and they 'll do it ,
i think that , uh , we simply must start accepting everybody in the world .
i mean , that was their job , as they killed in washington d c .
he really is an , you know ,
and some of those people , they do n't deserve to be let loose .
t i -s got , uh , a lot of advances in it really .
if woman 's role , like we said , if women 's roles change drastically , men 's roles will , too .
they have , uh , wonderful features ,
you know , real met fans do n't like the yankees
they need , you- ,
but it 's , all of a sudden it 's starting to get really scary with these gangs .
it was needed ,
but that 's not really providing you news .
it 's really good ,
i think it will be nonex- , pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper .
and there 'd be no more argument .
but there 's always that margin of error .
then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing .
but , um , i think , i think news is ,
and , you 're putting your life on your , on the line everyday .
they 're captive .
and they do n't want to think about it .
they 're so darned cheap now .
i , i think they should have just done more , uh ,
i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that were so hateful towards the united states have come away with , uh , kind of a different attitude .
i think you save a lot of the cleaning service 's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to , to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step --
the judge might know
but ,
uh , even if people have good intentions , i think uh , power corrupts or something to a certain extent , you know .
that 's true .
it was a pretty wild experience .
and that 's not fair ,
and they go down the line ten years
-- if you get it on sale ,
well , i decided that , you know , you need that once in awhile . that you , you need to plan the quality time
and they did , do , do do a lot of public service activities ,
people have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in .
but i meant for some , when both parties agreed that yes , we 're going to have a judge here .
so it all comes filtering down to us all in- , individually .
you have to keep up with them .
it 's kind of scary because they 're so bright .
and maybe that 's a benefit to everybody , you know .
and then , of course , the bottom fell out .
i , i , think , you know , that the whole idea of , uh , the death penalty was invented for two reasons .
uh , they 're outrageous !
gosh i 'm sure , not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas
and they rush to get the same thing .
i never have liked her ,
but , you know , i think a lot of people , like i said , are more concerned ,
it seems like rolando blackman and , and harper sort of carry the team ,
oh gosh , it 's worth your time to just upgrade ,
serving on the jury would be definitely more respo , you 'd have to be a definitely more responsible person .
and , and i just sort of think that 's ridiculous .
i guess we 've gotten more of a ,
i do n't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the , the disadvantages that would happen to the people in america --
i mean , you know , i think the people in those country do want our help . the people that are under conditions that are , you know , not favorable to this their rights .
and it really , it 's affecting the families --
and that 's good .
but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes , i think it 's pretty high .
yes , i would feel , uh , you 're right , that my civil rights had been violated .
quorums are to easy to get .
we do not .
i , i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just , um , get it into different categories like that ,
and , i think they need that .
definitely that area , that , that 's big time .
i , i think most employers would probably rather hire , you know , a , a three six in , um , in history , uh , to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration .
and ,
and i know there 's a lot of pollutants we ca n't even see coming out of --
-- but i do believe it 's necessary
and they 're fun .
most of them do the --
there is , there 's an awful lot of things set up , you know , just any , anything you want to do .
and the way it is now , it 's not .
they kept just showing , you know , how great we were doing
you know , there 's so much --
it 's terrible ,
whereas yeah in a smaller ,
most people , uh , a great number of people now work at various , at different jobs that , if a third of the people are shift workers , they wo n't be able to get to the , to the polls in any case . if they , uh , have to work late into the evening and not get up .
it , it really just turned out nicely .
and the reason is because the market place does n't seem to have performed adequately , uh , the invisible hand that which adam smith wrote has , uh , provided some very good health care and , uh , much , i think inadequate health care . uh ,
usually , you know something breaks ,
these people have given so much of their lives , you know , to , to america --
we 're not going to say we 're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years ,
you know , it 's a very common thing .
but it 's the best one we 've got .
and you just might resemble somebody .
or something the way they had the trial
so i think there 's a lot of people that have , you know , really , i guess that you 'd call it really sport fishing ,
everybody likes that .
if it was presented to see .
but i do n't much think so .
our , our , our senate and congress and , and people that , that deal everyday and , and what 's going to be done with those monies --
so the more we communicate , hey , look , we want a change here , because , you know , as it turns out , we 've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country .
and i 'm sure they hit a few every now and then ,
and it 's like , you know , that 's a big problem
we always , we think of the k g b and we think such bad things , you know .
i 'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations , you know .
i think that 's really good .
and it 's just a hoot to watch them .
th- , they , make conclusions in them that may or --
oh , and if you try to get it outside of your corporation , you 're going to pay an arm and a leg .
that 's pretty good .
that would be much more convenient .
uh , now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter ,
and i think that that would make them drool any way .
but you wo n't find me dealing in drugs ,
everybody loves their car ,
but again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly , uh , commercials ,
i do n't think anyone does , in fact .
so that 's kind of a --
so , uh , they had to have picked them up from , uh , the t v .
i , i think that , i mean , i think that they really are doing a good thing now
well , gasoline , especially , in this part of the country we all use it all the time , you know ,
and , uh , tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them , which is not bad .
that 's , uh , this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting
i mean if you look at the , the high unemployment rate right now
but i , i , i would , i would probably go for , for going ahead and doing it , you know . if it 's got to be done for everyone .
but --
and it seems like a lot of the orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools .
you ca n't .
then they have to negotiate almost everything
it seemed like , it was almost like you were living on an island
i really think .
but they 'd just have to mail it to you , i suppose , huh .
some , i think they more of their parts plastic , which , you know , makes things break easier ,
as long as it 's not used to delay the trial so much .
and they 're going to fight with them .
and --
oh , i think , i think it 's just a crying shame , uh ,
it 's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes .
it 's bigger than just the benefits part .
i mean , i think they 're doing their duty ,
that 's interesting ,
i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from ,
that would have been best time to go .
-- and i think maybe , uh , and that 's the type of , the thing that should be , you know , stressed .
the movie was nothing compared to the book .
and so , uh , it 's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn , you know , that , that they need to learn at the age , you know --
we , as americans were n't producing anything .
and , you know , it 's a shame
now , see that is a nice attitude to go into .
and you got to put put stuff in them you know .
they did not show them care to these small children who are being left .
and it 's not as boring if you get several people --
children are so full of energy .
and i think the other thing is the news me- , media puts such a blitz on it that they we- , had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting , you know .
maybe it should go with a driver 's license .
and you do n't get the soreness .
making it unanimous sometimes might , uh , let , the only thing , it might let more people get off .
though i tend to be , we tend to be skeptical .
i think people are getting so fed up with it .
and instead of having a , a socialized pension , it just would be really money that you and your company ,
it 's a scream ,
and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more , uh , much better in many ways .
golf is just ,
i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets --
well , i 'd , i 'd say actually i mean as someone who 's involved in education i 'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the , role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society .
it really does n't ,
i figure well , if they claim that it 's going to cost us eighty-six billion , it 's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes
now , see , i would have never figured that , i would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that 's limited edition .
you probably have n't either unless you 're a radio buff .
but i , i would think i , if i did anything , i would protect the juror from , from any sort of an inquisition after .
so , i think that will be a lot of fun .
so many of us have led sheltered lives --
it was ,
you know it 's funny how pets get to be so , uh ,
well , i mean ,
then that would ,
-- and i think that was just an attempt that , that fidel castro to undermine , you know --
and it 's a lot of work , owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it .
and a lot times people think , oh , well , i 'm not blessed
good teachers
i guess when the veterans went to washington --
a lot of them .
-- you ca n't take care of them ,
i mean , it does n't work , i mean .
that looks good .
i , i do n't know if you get into the mind set where you just say , well , i 'll accept something , or you just really have to get on their back , i mean ,
it 's just , you know , a possible solution --
they do not have it in europe , as i understand .
they would understand more .
nice and quick and easy to put up .
but whether they 're soon enough and fast enough i do n't know ,
i , i seem to remember that , uh , little byline on a lot of things i 've read .
they 're beautiful .
but i think in the end it would make life a lot easier for --
well , the way i , the way i see it , is ,
i think if the president can prove that he 's popular , you know , that he can do the job --
on air pollution i , i , i do n't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really .
well , we have to keep talking , i guess .
it increases each year i think .
so , we got into it fairly cheaply ,
he deserves it ,
but i suspect it would work .
i think probably in a small ,
so i probably ca n't .
it 's , it 's sad , though , that , uh , that the people , though , that
uh , the parents usually took out time , uh , you know , more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity .
that 's unbelievable .
i , i agree that , that the communication that now , that communication has ,
and even , you know , people are , seem to , a lot of people seem to be engaged for a long time before they get married --
sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea .
but , you know , if you go two or three years without having that ,
and with interest , you know i found some people that were members of our church which was different .
but , uh , uh , so i think nursing homes are , have changed .
if you never see it you do n't spend it ,
which is a good deal .
but it just has n't been what i thought it would be .
we 're fortunate that way , that i make enough to do what we want to do .
and i guess that i thought was a real good acting and writing job both , you know , because i think , or directing job .
so i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled ,
and , and so often when you , when you bring in the advantages , the resources and so forth , there , there is a trade .
every one of us , most of us have our , have all four feet in the trough , you know . plus our snout , right up to our ears .
so they , they think well i 'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat
you know , if it 's free , people will use it ,
these people , you know , they bring their , their johns home
they , they call it an invasion of privacy .
so it 's pretty scary .
they really do .
and , you know , if i , if we help elect a president who 's going to save us , then , then the whole country will be saved .
well , it 's not , the , uh , uh , it 's not the best system ,
that sound good .
because when you do have to be in front of people ,
and there are some really , really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models .
uh , people are , uh , reluctant to pass , uh , school tax levies even , uh , when the money is needed or would be well spent because it 's , uh , they do n't have kids in the schools .
i find that , uh , that the corvettes are , are becoming really , really nice cars .
but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , it 's kind of like what they keep talking about the , uh , the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things --
if the gun shop owner does it ,
it , they are just gems of shows .
and they would not do these bad things , you know .
so they have one and three quarters jobs now . whereas the husbands have one and a quarter .
but i 'm troubled by too close a clinging to , to the past
it 's , yeah , it 's not a big deal .
oh , he 's interesting .
i would think so ,
if it works at colleges it will work down below .
they had such a super team .
but , uh , i do think we learned .
uh , monetarily too , i just do not think we have done enough for the , uh , vietnamese people as a whole . uh , in south vietnam , in general , in helping them restore themselves .
they may , you know , may be better if they give up just a little bit to settle things down .
but it , it seems nice enough .
so they must be collecting information about who does it , and how often .
you go through college
um , those are nice .
well , um , i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party .
but i- , it 's , it was interesting .
and it 's going to be a difficult transition .
and , um , you know , when the truth , oh , well ,
i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all
i would have said that it was more prevalent here in the united states .
since i imagine it 's fairly competitive .
and it does begin with the families at home --
but , uh , the , uh , uh , now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is , uh , an economic enterprise to train people for jobs .
i think the other thing that 's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we have n't ,
i do n't think they should do away with the seat belts now .
it 's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids
it 's getting to a point that you have to have it ,
but it really gets down to the particular teacher .
they , they really do n't ,
the way kids , the way kids are , you know , i mean , they can , you know .
so , mostly , it 's just kind of one of those things that goes away .
he , he always did such a good job , i thought .
there are two people who say well he just looks guilty , um .
it 's pretty scary .
it puts them in a very bad situation .
but then we started thinking , especially in plano , the weather is so hot in august , that there really is n't a lot the children can do outside anyhow .
especially if they 're found guilty of the crime .
probably lots of laughs .
that would force everybody to use it . or to quit selling tape measures in inches .
even , even a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something .
and that would be pushing it .
so maybe that covers the topic then .
he 's very good .
that 's kind --
and in this country , uh , the , the solution that , that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable .
that is a really pretty state park .
i , you , i think there 's , there can be a lemon in anything --
but uh , you know , but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gon na be , you know
you always find something a little extra that you 'd like to get that month
well , that 's , that 's one of the , really , a valid point that people need --
that 's for sure .
well , you can reduce that risk by , uh , having the car checked out ,
i , i , it 's a little far fetched to ,
then if you do n't have qualified teachers in the different mumblex ,
but --
either , um , either you have not played it , or , or you , you have played it
it 's , it 's also a way of relieving stress .
it can it can be fun i if you have the time
so you 're just the opposite from me .
i guess it could be worse .
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want .
and , and that way we can be sure , you know ,
-- you know , i mean , it is a rather final solution , though .
but you know i guess you 'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough .
and , you know , you just are tempted to give in to that ,
because , uh , you know , not everybody plays of course , but they 're still ,
that 's probably more true than ,
that 's , that 's a , that 's a tricky one .
but that same person also has a family
so it 's , it 's not always the school 's systems
you can have them in ,
well , i , i think it 's a pretty good idea .
and so it 's a , it 's kind of a depressing topic though .
and the sacrifice is not that great .
and all these politicians make , make hay over , you know --
and you wonder why they ca n't just stop it .
well you know i think richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
i mean it 's like they 're turned off on voting .
i think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him look , look worse that what his , um , what his ideals are ,
i 'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and , uh , that , uh , uh ,
and it 's , uh , oh , it 's just , i do n't know , it 's , it 's a total free relaxation .
well , i could certainly , personally stand seeing them go to a , a standardized compensatory time --
we , we fall out of , uh , agreements with certain leaders
that 's , that 's alwa- , well , that 's kind of a hobby
and , uh , i think , uh , to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised .
there would probably be very few exceptions to that
in reality , i think , what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves ,
they just ca n't do it .
still 's that way to some extent .
he , he , you know , we know he 's a good leader ,
every once in a while they come in handy .
i bet .
because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want .
and i think there has been definite changes of nursing homes
hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit ,
things that are kind of oddball , like , uh , thai cuisine ,
well , the , one thing 's for sure we can always discuss the weather ,
because they do n't have the family roots anymore .
it does because you 're , you know , you , you 're , you know , you 're just co , costing yourself more money because you , if you ca n't make the monthly , the minimum payment , you 're paying interest ,
i think everyone would ,
that 's a real neat idea .
it 's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semi-conductor firm ,
well there are some of the few organizations that have the funds to , uh , you know , do like big big works . uh ,
i think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to ,
it is tough .
and that 's not going to be good .
even when he 's sad , you know , you great faith that he will get happy again .
but , seems like the jury system does have it 's advantages .
uh , so it 's effected all of us .
i think so .
there probably needs to be some training on how to , to , to adjust to these changes as they come about .
and , uh , it gives you a little bit , uh , more a glimpse of the , the real world
they , uh , really listen to
i mean , as sorrowful as it is . uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled from his license ,
but it 's , it was really fun .
but they have been nice to have around .
uh , and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done --
well , that , that 's , uh , is an advantage of being in the education field .
it 's not , they do n't care about anybody --
that 's , that 's what the t v stations do .
uh , the other , the other thing that , uh , bothers me about our system is just that , uh , in , for , for , in , in , in congress the amount of power any , any particular congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they 've been there
you can as a teacher , ca n't hold a child accountable ,
it 's just a , it 's just a miracle that how fast that adds up , you know .
you know , they teach their children , uh , in such a way that ,
once you realize how much money you 've got to spend , then you start looking around at , at what you can buy with it , where before i think you , you looked at the car you wanted ,
they just , you know , just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down , and in a while get around to it .
i think it would be worth it everybody wo- ,
and you seem to be making out all right .
and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases .
they , they do .
it 's sort of unusual really .
but , uh , in terms of demanding , it 's just not caused
or , you know , because it , they ca n't remove themselves ,
uh , national health insurance , i think , is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive .
and , on a , a scale , i guess it 's still considered small .
and , and that 's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself
but i believe that , uh , an individual should really learn how to , to learn --
what a coincidence .
it almost seems like they 're getting quite a bit smarter .
so , uh , you know , you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do .
normally we do n't have too much , uh , humidity or , or , uh , rainy time when it 's past june .
paper does n't seem threatening at all , you know .
that 's a lot of fun .
but , the likelihood certainly tilts it .
they 're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around ,
i mean you can only talk about , about the situation just so long .
and it ,
and sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like , well i 've done a good job because i got , worked myself to that point .
and they just do , they do n't care as much .
uh , i suspect a lot of people , uh , uh , got , uh , turned on by watching , watching those go off .
but , the , uh ,
they have to have guidance
they really grow up quick . especially at that early age .
it 's kind of an interesting plan .
and maybe part of that is educating parents better .
well , real interesting .
that , you know , they say putting them out to pasture
but --
that 's good .
they really make themselves look bad ,
but actually it 's a privilege ,
that applies to anything as well as guns .
you know , it 's just necessary .
and they are , those are expensive tests .
but they 're going to learn it sometime ,
fathers do n't even like malls ,
but there 's a lot of other public service things --
i guess that 's another thing that to me is a , a real problem ,
and , you know , they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this ,
it just takes up , you know , like you say , a lot of your garden area .
you have to .
you would have expected them to be the last ones to .
i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days , or you could mail it in , or something like , if you have , if you have real strict work hours , and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long --
and i think a lot of , a lot of car manufacturers do n't really keep that into consider- , do n't take that into consideration --
i think one of the thing that i notice a lot ,
it 's one we all hold dear and near , i 'm sure .
and i think part of it was they did n't , uh , they did n't like the fact that i do n't drink any more .
it 's already ,
seafood seems to be a lit , a little bit more expensive than , than other types of food .
obviously nobody 's smart enough to have figured it out yet ,
you 'll see that on the evening news .
it 's just , you know , too easy to do .
you have more of a choice ,
and that 's what 's causing all the killing .
i mean , everything seems to be based on the same thing .
i mean --
i think they would have to have some training .
well , they 're companions ,
well you might , uh , generate some --
and it seems like everything is raising , every- , everything that can be , cigarettes ,
eye care is good .
i , i guess another thing that concerns me is , uh , so many people , it seems like everybody today is still in that mumblex job market
and it 's like well , you know , they 're educating their people to higher degrees than we do .
that 's very interesting , never thought of that .
they seem just to be so chocked full of , of ads .
and , uh , i 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is .
but --
because they made a big deal about how this , this film was such a big leap for the , the people who , who were the ancestors of the , this indian tribe
well that 's what i was going to point out , i think it mostly is that technical ,
i thought , uh , i thought ,
that ca n't be good for los angeles either .
after a while --
something else has to go away --
and then i do n't think we projected what was going to happen after the war ,
you would n't want him to carry her off or something .
that 's a little early .
you know . and they only did it because they , i guess they were embarrassed --
that was sort of the beginning of , ye shall be treated fairly .
it 's pretty tough to keep up with .
it 's so , it would be really hard now to have twelve children .
kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds ,
-- and very , very comfortable car .
they got thrown right into the total mainstream --
-- those are the two that can , that , that have the wherewithal
it 's not as easy ,
they do an absolutely necessary job ,
i just thought they had some ,
i think , uh , that that is a tough , uh ,
you expect more out of , uh , julia roberts , though .
i mean everywhere you , you look , you are getting something new .
they are n't testifying really in their own words ,
if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass ,
and that can be part of continuing education , maybe for judges .
substitute .
that 's , that 's wonderful for the child .
uh , i 'm not sure in the last ten years it 's been very different from before .
but then again , so many times you get one or two holdouts ,
well , you know , uh , talking about the lawyers , you know what might very well do , uh , cause a , uh , a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases .
and it , that 's works well because you can design it to , to suit whatever equipment you have
it 's against the law to do a lot of things , you know .
well , i think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the , or a lot less of the ,
we 're , we 're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out .
and i think that , um , they might , you know , pay for that .
but it would be come back .
but , to me , when you do the crime , then you should pay for whatever you did ,
and --
some ways it 's rather frightening ,
the price already drops in half .
they , they get what they hear from ,
i mean , you think about it now ,
and you 've got , uh , all kinds of people knocking on your door and , who want to , uh , either direct you to the right path or , or want to , uh , sell you , uh , paper routes , uh , whatever ,
uh , i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now .
it 's just , it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think ,
but , uh , it 's getting , uh , uh , getting pretty big everywhere , as i see it .
-- you 've got to have something to --
and , you know , they just have n't done a real complete case here to my thinking .
but , it could be put to more practical use .
but , i think that 's for the , the few and far between .
well , it was a political move .
you really truly do .
it just kind of --
i mean , and i just do n't think it 's healthy
you get used to it .
and , and most people that , uh , break in or whatever , go to houses without the dogs ,
it 's , it 's hard to , to know anymore if it 's a , a threat one way or another because , uh , it used to be s- , so , f- , much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell , you know , rank and file in behind it .
for that reason it can stay the same ,
and maybe that 's going to happen to america where they 'll say , hey
and i figure we 're paying to take care of this toxic waste , no matter who does it .
it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am ,
but , uh , i- , it 's worth it once you get it .
they do forget , it 's true , coul , because everybody ,
we 're , we 've already been overtaken ,
and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents .
and i 'm sure that , that , that there are some reasons for good .
but , um , unless it is , i guess it 's kind of a waste .
he wanted to direct it ,
and so if that 's true , it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was , that went down the tube somewhere .
and that was it ,
of course , you know , there 's not one on every corner ,
you have grandchildren ,
but sunday you 're getting ready for monday .
but it 's not just , you know , horrible ,
but --
the population in those schools are , are , typically , uh , people that very much value the education and support --
i mean , you ca n't change things overnight .
a man can afford the necessities , a woman affords the luxuries .
i , i , i think , uh , law would be a fine field , a fine profession , fine field to go into .
it was .
you 're , you 're really performing a , a benefit to society --
i mean i think that would be , it would , it would strike one as strange if there 's no reason for --
and i think that is , that is the point .
-- uh , the other thing when you 're talking about freon with cars , uh , air conditioning , i 'm sure --
and , uh , and i , that 's hard to be a caretaker i really believe .
i think that 's what aggravates a lot of people , is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty ,
if they 're going to do random , um ,
it 's kind of an easy thing to talk about .
metric system , no one 's very , uh , no one wants it at all seems like .
that 's also a good reason why it , it ,
they , they hurt themselves a little bit in that way .
because all the eligible --
the old-timers , even the people who are technologists do n't know how to operate these electronic things like v c r -s and whatnot
the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular t v programming and watch a lot of other , a variety of programs out there , as well as use of the v c r --
i do n't think that they , anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government .
but we have a , a marvelous band instructor ,
and progressive tax , i think , uh , does not give people incentive to make more money ,
or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it .
and , and it would be , uh , you know , out of the question .
and then every so often you weed through them
because , uh , most likely that will happen , wo n't it , that , you know ,
well , i mean , i think ,
i think they have them in dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools , different things happening ,
well jeans are n't exactly professional
i think that 's one thing that i would look at if i was putting my grandmother or my mother , uh , in some sort of home .
um , that 's what i want .
if you , if you had to chose , i guess i would , i am sure i would take the lethal injection .
i thought that was wonderful .
at the end of the season , the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt , because , uh , laufenberg just could n't ever really get it together at all .
you know , you 're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever .
because it is a difficult situation
if you do n't care about property and people , you know , you 're not going to care about , uh , about learning , i think .
they 're not worth it .
you hear the same , same tune over and over again --
mumblex that must have been hard on him because he 's just a person
and i 'm not sure that tho- , those programs are available to do that .
but , uh , it 's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals .
it really is .
now i think maybe it 's started changing in the past few years because , uh , they have of these , uh , sort of mandatory , -tory tests if you have to take before you get --
and there will be a lot of rebellion in that
it 's hard to imagine what life was like without it now .
and ,
it 's whether or not you 're a resident for that jurisdiction ,
-- but they do n't .
and the , you know , the thought that i , i see the , uh , the mall rats , you know , walking around the mall , nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long , when they could be doing something to help someone .
government is going to have to change in this regard .
i think it 's , it 's probably the work that your , your children , your children are doing , uh , um ,
there is no need to have children if you do n't want them .
so it 's very much the same kind of place and , uh --
so that 's not too bad .
because you might find that it 's beyond , uh , what you 're willing to put into it .
kind of depends on the quality of carpet , i suppose ,
it 's like last season was so long ago
and it was very , very funny .
but i think the script was , you know , just incredible compared to the last one .
but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it .
it all boils down to , whether it 's our side , their side ,
but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of , sort of thing .
if it 's a policeman and he 's working with , uh , the public and he has a , and has a gun in his holster or , or even , you know , if it 's a guy at mcdonald 's cooking a burger , i think , they 're dangerous in either situation .
you always hear how good .
they are , they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower .
but over here , where we 're promised the civil liberties of purs- , life , liberty and pursuit of happiness , then taking that away is a , a heinous act .
it 's , it 's a total experience , you know , getting out in nature and ,
it can be very --
but it does n't really feel like you 're in the country .
and it had such a good story , too .
if they really wanted to vote republican , they could go in the primary and say they were voting democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the republican could beat .
and they have their own quirks and tolerances and ,
i think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is jordan 's king hussein because he really kind of ,
and you , you know , you just oh , it 's , it 's , kind of an eye-opener .
i do n't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere .
one , one of the problems they 're facing now , a lot of people now , is that the health insurance is that the small business ca n't , ca n't offer health insurance --
it 's the hard work .
i mean , they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby ,
-- and in fact , i 'm not sure that that 's any more , uh , liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than , than anything else .
it may be good for someone who already has self discipline , who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own ,
those are funny labels , see .
i think , i think they 're a bit over exposed .
well i think we 've really come a long way in that because ,
and they do n't seem to ,
-- and i think that 's the only reason i have a problem with it , when there 's no , you know , there 's no reason --
and , and ,
we 'll have some interesting discussion , i guess .
but i really do think that women have made a contribution --
if , if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the , they were unused to their , that , the way they run things ,
i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is , is , uh --
i do n't think anyb- , any --
well , there 's a zillion of them .
i think ,
it 's just a matter of , like you say , are the advantages , does it justify the cost , if you 're using it strictly for personal business .
and then man she 's really porked out again i guess
if you do n't terminate him , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person .
and that 's why it 's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions .
it 's really kind of , uh , choreographed .
well , it 's amazing ,
and actually when you think back on the big events of the war , it was , uh , it was almost a personal struggle among these three , uh ,
i mean it 's just a precaution for everybody .
but there 's no thinking involved , no motion , you know ,
no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it .
same thing .
maybe a people are a little o- , more open-minded than maybe they used to be .
but really we did n't think about the people that he was going , tr- ,
it 's just , so , it 's a lot of work , too --
it is expensive .
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence .
they , they 've given that away for fifty years .
if you can find one that 's r- , uh , you know , reliable .
uh , i 'm not , i 'm not so sure that overseas help , helping overseas would be such a hot idea for , for , uh , a lot of young k- , people .
and it seems as though we are , uh , giving the criminal the benefit , more than the victim .
they , they understand violence .
we- , you 'll help out a little bit .
obviously what we are doing is not working , you know .
it wo n't hurt them .
you 'd really open a can of worms .
but they were so , seemed ,
and that causes a lot of trouble .
and i think that 's true ,
so many , uh , women are heads of state
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous .
but you know , that 's , that 's what happens when , you know , the cork blows
it 's been my experience , most people want , uh , to feel like they 're participating in something that , uh , that is not a drudgery , you know , that they --
i do n't think it 's as bad as l a either .
but you , you know , it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot .
and , and the added costs get passed on to you ,
but you 'd think that we 're still in , that
but , i guess i believe , i think the n r a has gone overboard the wrong way . you know ,
ev- , more harmed or something .
and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place ,
you know , in , in the , in , you know , i hope that what 's happening is exactly the way it appears .
but you know , i like to know more , i mean , hear about more people that have things like that you know ?
sounds a lot a like a walt disney film .
and ,
it got over so fast ,
our junior high band is just wonderful .
that is a hugh difference .
everybody makes mistakes , unfortunately .
now , those are very handy --
of course , we would n't have the retail market we have either
he 'd be good at it .
and all these people come around ,
and the ones you buy ,
the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying , well , i 'm going to mug this guy right here
and we 're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of , you know --
it 's hard to find people like that .
well , the --
it was n't nearly as much fun when bradshaw was playing for you guys , i 'll tell you .
so it 's not really lucrative to take chances like that , you know , even though it , it does exist .
that would be a real good motivation for people .
tough topic
and she does n't know who she is
it 's a good show .
which i do n't think we are loaning anymore now ,
uh , so , you know , they kind of have gotten into the idea that let 's drug test them and let 's put them through rehab .
and maybe
i mean , they tax american imports quite heavily .
and , and you can influence the way things are .
it does n't do anyone any good .
i mean that 's the point we all should be at , is like finding some solution ,
i guess it 's always not , not being able to picture one more ,
but , you know , you know , i think , you know , the , the price , you know ,
and there was a point to it ,
but there 's got to be some control
they were great men ,
and not a , and not a very good one at that .
so , and that cost us , the country , you know , billions of dollars .
i mean , you can look businesslike in , in a pant- , the same pant suit you would , you know --
anyway it 's the only car that says , you know , sporty and class , uh ,
i mean that 's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube .
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much , you know , trouble . because the three fifty with all the , you know ,
the only difference was that the government said , okay
the , uh , i think maybe there 's where the problem came in , you know .
everything has changed .
but they 're going to do it anyway because they know they 're not supposed to .
well , at this stage i think we 've taxed property almost to the limit because ,
people , um , you know , just go on and on and on .
and they have these really corny radio commercials --
that 's more than a lot .
um , it 's a problem if those voting do n't represent the population demographically , or in terms of their opinions .
i , i am .
well , it 's amazing just because of the drain that 's been on , you know , both economies that our economy is , of course , been able to , uh , withstand that a little better ,
that 's a real good show .
but then they 're , they 're also entitled to drag it through the courts --
so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else .
but , uh , i do n't believe they accept you after you , you know , after you 're married
well , th- , it , it 's an advantage .
-- then they should pay taxes then .
or , you know , they 're both just as bad ,
they can talk a good game ,
there 's the lead pollution has , that problem , essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was ,
i think that if i were really serious about looking for another car , i would take into consideration the price naturally .
so that should help .
the world does not revolve around west virginia --
but like you said , you tend to go more for the other one 's side --
you , you have to work on .
uh , th- , that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every ,
but more importantly , it 's recycling reusable materials back into , uh , manufacturing .
-- so you , you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself ,
it , it , uh , i guess it all comes down to , uh , you know , a , a definition of , uh , how much out , outside activities affect your work
miniature golf is great ,
well , i think that , uh , as a whole that the , being that the drug problem , the drug industry can , uh , bring so much money to a country .
and that made you even feel a little more kin to , to what was going on .
it has affected the culture of this country , uh ,
it is not too hard .
and that would upset a lot of people too ,
and they 're not , um , th- , they do n't have the self-esteem that they need to have
i mean , they were n't there by choice
well , that 's a good idea .
i think that , uh , you know , you can just look at home life and see , i 've been talking to a lot of people a- , about education and things ,
and , and they 're very dissatisfied ,
you went visiting .
but , but they , they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal .
i mean , they 're going to want the money ,
-- mumblex and , the , the , the , uh , at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker --
uh , i think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty , you know , in a lot of cases .
it 's always that way unti- , until it 's too late .
it 's easy to say , oh , yeah ,
well maybe something will open up for you .
we see it , you know , once a month . i 'm sure in san antonio they see it more often than that .
uh , i guess there 's more women in , uh , what would be classified as a man 's job .
maybe some day i probably wo n't be alive to see it ,
and , uh , you know , to start even that out we need to continue to , you know , at least threaten that , you know ,
but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision .
it 's handy .
like i said , the risque stuff , just i guess they think that 's what people want to watch .
and that 's when it really starts to add on ,
the only thing really that can be changed is for us to , everybody to say , we 've had enough of you , out you go .
in a smaller company it 's a little bit easier for them to say , hey , you know , this person did a wonderful job , give him a big bonus kind of thing .
it 's dangerous .
it 's not that bad of a life as it should be --
and so , when , uh , you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what 's what because we see the headlines , uh ,
and it always will be ,
oh , definitely motherhood is devalued in this s- , society .
and too many people are just dying .
we maybe want to overthrow the government .
and we 're supposed to be , you know ,
and it 's so much easier ,
and when he left the show , you know , that , it seemed to be missing that part of it --
i think he was .
-- so it , i mean , it protects us in the long run hopefully --
and i think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until , you know , late , you know , in the future .
the rest , the rest of that is re- , really not the same .
ca n't ,
i , i sometimes think that that should be limited more .
i probably would say the something if i knew that inte- , intellectually that it was good
and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks .
you always kind of sit there
if they were , you know , th- , abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse .
and i thought to myself , how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks ,
i guess so .
though we 've had such a breakdown in the family structure ,
i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system .
uh , it 's just an economic need now .
but , people are really concerned ,
i mean it is relaxing to do , once you find the time to do it .
-- just a little --
if you are looking at like you know country that , uh , where they do have a lot more gun control , like england and places like that , you know
as long as you can still buy a product in the english units , that 's how you 're going to think of it .
oh , the wild flowers are beautiful .
but apparently that 's why the , uh , the , uh , the , uh , grocery stores are reluctant to do that , because their volume , that is quite high ,
there , i do n't think there 's much of , much of one , because i 'm sure all the people from cuba have been released from that camp that they were in .
things like that are a good start
and there are certainly benefits to its doing so ,
and , you know , it 's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses .
so , you 're going to have to expect it .
and when you want to get out of the country , that 's what you want to do .
you know , maybe you gain a little bit of local fame ,
that was pretty good , though , really .
i , i actually do n't think that we , uh , pay too much in this country . uh --
it 's just the system has just ,
and , you know , they , you know , they , they make their mess in the cat pan which is ,
they 're good temperament .
-- and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket , they 're going to hit you over the head .
and mumblex . you know , you can as far as i 'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say .
oh , it is probably in there just burping goldfish .
it 's just not good .
maybe you 're right ,
uh , the , there is not much incentive for innovativeness --
their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than , say , your major network news and that kind of thing .
i think that 's how they measure dirt --
and you have to get a feel for , uh , how they treat the kids and , uh , uh , what kind of staff members they have and --
maybe next year they 'll do better .
and if there needs to be a change in a period of time .
and that 's , that 's kind of fun .
that 's something that i think that has been lost in families
but i think a lot of , all of the whole criminal system is messed up in , in that regard .
so . that 's a ,
i , i think it 's a wonderful thing to do .
and there 's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist ,
that 's for sure .
that 'd be just as dangerous .
and i think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore ,
that 's kind of funny too , as a matter of fact .
well , that 's why --
but it 's funny that , uh ,
and , and a mother is n't an important --
what they use is roast beef .
the basic family is not there anymore .
i mean , it just ,
it should be a mess .
i 'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people ,
i mean there 's too many ,
everything is so automated , uh ,
it 's remarkable the things we can do now , and compared to , you know , a few years .
it 's funny some of their necks do n't get broken .
and they 're --
and , and , of course , when it 's a small corporation , it also wants to expand
and you do n't know which set to reach in , american or metric .
to prevent these people from ever getting out on the street .
they 're very ,
and money .
if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers --
and , uh , without the lord , they ca n't do it .
but i ,
we , we 've taken the intermediate step
well , i guess i will have to see it then .
that 's good , especially since you call that one eight hundred number
you know , i think it 's out of sight or out of mind ,
that 's good as a , a , a teaching aid .
if it 's more than thirty it 's just hotter than all get out .
well , you know , they 'd have to start when they 're real young .
but , god this is much better than west texas .
and with age comes ,
i 'm sure they do .
i may just be flat painting over it .
and , um , coming from , you know , that background and the background as a parent now , i think the reason that people do n't ask a whole lot of questions is a , a lot of times baby-sitters ,
but i , it 's i do , i can , i can get so much more done if i 'm dressed comfortable , you know .
i really think the biggest problem
they do have a good , they do have good writers for that .
i think probably two years is too long .
well , i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people .
and i 'm saying that pensions , say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away , which it probably will ,
but sometimes , it 's just , it 's baby-sitting .
you really are ,
a lot of shops are , are operated by southeast asians .
because they , they start ,
but it 's still been bad --
that 's , that 's pretty average to me .
and , and , uh , so that , that creates a problem .
i think it 's a good idea to make it mandatory .
uh , but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves .
and i think it could get worse .
your , your trees grow up so well up there ,
and i think that , i think we need to , a little more justice at home .
it 's got to be with a very , very good agency .
we do n't think of any one else but oursel- ,
pittsburgh 's not quite so bad .
we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing .
sounds like something she would write .
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved .
we can find out the truth ,
it 's interesting how they say that when they 're usually the top dogs , you know ,
i 'm sure , in dallas since you 're big places , a lot more women are , uh , working right out of their home with their p c 's or with their lap computers or whatever .
well , i 'm afraid that 's what they , they really wanted to do , um ,
it 's really strange the way it does that .
and , and , you know , and , it , it 's almost like ,
that was .
i guess it 's too early .
and , uh , it 's just that , you know , people , people take advantage of that .
well that makes a difference .
if , you know , in a democracy where , you know , people have kind of , uh , a freedom to sort of do what they want ,
well , they 're dangerous .
it just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession --
and you know , you 're pretty much dead you know .
but it , you know --
that 's pretty impressive .
it makes , you know , pressure on the nation , and on the people , and on the leadership , and makes their inflation go up ,
and they 're both inevitable .
i , i could n't see it worth getting a nomination for , uh , best picture .
and , uh , uh , uh , they could , they could work and earn money towards college .
but i do n't think that 's going to happen because , just like you said ,
and , and that 's pretty much what it is , is --
it seems like every week they pick ten
that sounds right i
so , i , i try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find , find really good recipes where you would n't even think about it .
it should n't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that , you know , reasonableness .
and that must be the thing .
and that still goes on .
we 've got a , several credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time .
so it 's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things .
for me i would much rather have a bow anytime .
that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people .
that would be devastating i 'm sure
they 're going to be on everyone 's mind for quite a while , too long .
but they may not go into teaching ,
like my since is it was there to try to protect small investors
that 's , that 's been interesting , though , the kids that have been over , you know , coming back right now , you know .
i just , i love that , all those , that two hours --
it 's just going to effect on the , the team , you know .
that 's , that 's ,
so , it 's difficult ,
and , uh , ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in , you know ,
and i think it 's an excellent movie for ,
and you know , what frightens me , is that , you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert --
that 's all you can do .
and it does n't seem to matter .
now everybody is available .
oh , i bet you those are , i bet you what those things are , uh , is a dutch iris .
and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes , you know , the juries come down with a result and you go , gee .
but the way our system , our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time .
but it 's funny ,
but , uh , you know , this ring of honor thing , you know , he needs to be there --
that 's good , that sounds like they 've got a lot going on there .
it keeps going ,
it 's going to , it 's probably going to be a generation or two before ,
and and both of them
i think it 's great ,
and whether you vote for one person or the other person , the issues is what , you know , what you believe in ,
well , the big key is that , i think you 've already stated , that all music is rooted in the classics
they have a lot of vegetable to them ,
california gets , you know , tends to be a bit faddish ,
just to prevent a --
and it takes up your whole space .
not lately though .
and they are controlled , or pretty much do what they want to do .
we 're really going to do it , you know .
we ca n't live here ,
and ,
so --
you know what scares me too , is that we have yet to see other , the biggest effect of the crack children --
you know , it 's going to kind of kind of go along with the b m w in the driveway and , or in the garage or whatever .
oh i , i 've got all four feet in the trough , you know , being a federal employee .
and i know a lot of , uh , corporations now are looking at their amount of money that 's being spent
i think that needs to ,
well , it started spiraling down , i suppose , in the seventies ,
well , if they do , they do n't know it , you know .
i feel like you get what you pay for
that 's the major thing .
i mean , i think everybody just lives under an umbrella , the uncertainty with housing --
well , there is n't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes .
and , uh , what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand --
i think it , it really , it really helped to have that time together .
-- and , uh , the premeditated murders , the ones where the person plots and plans , when you catch those , those individuals , i think that you , you end up with a , uh , uh , how do i want to , you end up with a s- , you end up with someone who 's more dangerous to society --
they do n't mash .
the lions are pretty good , i 'm afraid , they pro- , a lot better team than the cowboys were today .
oh , they 're good ,
i mean , there are a lot of kids who when they 're ten look like they 're twelve ,
i think everybody should , should , uh , put in their time so to speak for the , for the good of the , the nation and for the good of themselves .
you ca n't force them to be .
and --
although in my case i might have been more , uh , sympathetic with the person who got caught ,
and , and that might be the solution .
that would ,
or , you know , why , why , why intervene in another country 's , you know , problems and things like that .
well , and you know their , kind of their schedules
and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society ,
-- and , uh , of course , most of the homes are , you know , fairly nice ,
and they just , they just wreck things
people also have to realize they ca n't have their cake and eat it .
now let 's --
i wish that they would come up with some other way to , you know ,
and you very seldom see it though .
but you know , you can counsel a kid eight hours a day
and that , i think is what is scary ,
it , it 's possible ,
care for the elderly and care for the children ,
and ,
i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens , we 're going to have to bite the bullet .
but if you do a good job , you feel enough satisfaction ,
uh , course , there 's so many things in the world where , if you solve one problem , you may be creating another , you know .
you 're not too surprised on much of anything .
and , um , it 's just individual choices .
so we really do n't have , as long a cold season , i guess as people up north .
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it ,
i think we , uh , are programmed to just take it --
but all they 're good for is the fight .
and if it 's ,
i think he can be , you know , i , i do n't know if it 's the way it is in real life ,
it used to ,
-- the drummer plays a certain beat ,
they 're , uh , done up fairly nice , uh ,
that 'll , that 'll literally blow your head off ,
and then you , you know , you go down a path --
and they do n't have to worry about yard upkeep if they do n't hardly have any .
well , see the other way i 'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting , like , uh , the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons . anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves .
but i , i guess , uh , when you have a whole bunch of , uh , professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody 's got great hopes .
i mean , some people sing ,
because it 's a world thing
and so , you probably come out of it knowing , and by friends , i mean , like contacts for when you get out of school , um , you know ,
but i , i think definitely ,
but it 's really , it 's really , really very difficult
to me ,
and all the republic is trying to gain their independence ,
has nothing , you know .
that 's something , you know ,
and you can ,
so you use a credit card .
see that broke out a revival in mexico city . that c b s news and a b c never told you about .
i think they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use .
oh , i think that 's a ,
or --
no one knows what that is .
this is terrible ,
anyway , the deterrent .
that 's just , that 's one thing i see , i see a lot more , you know , double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that , i guess .
well , that 's my problem too .
you probably ca n't afford to eat if you have more than two of them .
but they 're supposed to be just real smooth .
but that 's the same
and , uh , they expect us to , you know , have , create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers --
so i think some place , you know , places like that , it should be like mandatory --
that can be awful .
but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that 's their opportunity
and , uh , she works as a waitress
but if your door comes open , you know , it 's not going to do you any good .
they 're pretty neat little ,
i , uh , i think that , uh , for once , we should , we should n't even be at , at these mid east talks because , with the exception of our hostages , we really do n't have too much of a , uh , real in- , we should n't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is .
well , i 'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them .
and , uh , benefits were just amazing --
it 's , it 's like our car industry ,
they do n't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards .
so ,
or they 're stuck in a day care .
and then , then start looking for schools .
-- and i think that art of giving is something that , um , we do n't have very much any more .
somebody 's finally woken up , you know .
those are just to get , probably to get some sort of , those are to get the shock value out of you .
i think one is enough .
and then if you want to play something on the little kids ' level , then the older kids get real bored ,
i think i agree with that very much .
but , uh , that 's the way it is .
and that 's , you know , one reason that i did it --
uh , there 's no way they can stop the drugs ,
well ,
-- and it 's really , you know , it 's , it gets to be a r- , a big problem .
but the government does it ,
but , uh , it 's just that , uh , they 're , eh ,
uh , it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity --
and , and the way you are also has changed , though .
and a lot of times , those are the things i do n't like to disclose to an employer because then they do n't want to have anything to do with you .
we only see the tip of the iceberg only .
it would be more convenient , more productive --
situations like that , you do n't realize , you know , until you start thinking about it , the kinds of mumblex advantages you school may have over others .
they have got them outgunned .
it 's religion couched as politics .
i guess you keep those things you grew up with .
but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps --
it would be unfair ,
well see , that , that is the spirit of the sixties .
those that should be in jail should be in jail .
so i think that , uh , they need to look into it
so , uh , just a , just a change of pace --
and next thing you know mumblex somebody 's trying to take more .
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life , you 're going to let it come into work
and i think that 's where ,
-- and that is , that 's what makes ,
i guess that 's true .
that 's probably a major one .
or , and it just extends with i- , if it , w , what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on
it 's going to be depending on where the , what they do with ruben sierra
but our crimes up here , uh , as i think it must be in most cities now ,
i mean , it 's time to , to either , you know , put out or shut up .
of course , they 're fully loaded usually .
it 's comfortable to drive .
everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits .
so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us .
and so it , it works out nice ,
and you just miss the little things ,
that 's scary .
i decided it looks better in better homes and gardens than it does in practicality .
maybe it should be , uh , well , it should be given , you know , i , i wo n't say sparingly ,
and generally it does work out that way .
but on the same token , you know , israel has lost a lot of their , you know , value to the u s in being , you know , the foothold of capitalism .
that 's where it 's at .
that 's really neat .
trying to write an essay , you start talking about , you know , like , in living color or something ,
it 's kind of , it 's kind of strange .
yet --
that 's what you pay
and maybe if we instilled the work ethic , you know ,
so even if it 's the country that they 're from or anything like that .
this country seems to be a little behind on that .
they probably did n't know what they were talking about .
that 's wrong .
i mean , if we were to , if , if something were to happen , i 'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of , for the sake of , uh , of , of unity against us or something --
it does n't have any real impact on them .
but i 'm sure that there were people that do n't .
i think it 's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two .
that , television , it gives you everything .
it was n't bad ,
i feel like there should be some kind of coverage made ,
that sounds good .
it 's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day
and you get some beautiful effects with them .
and they 're not too pleasant .
all , it 's a home centered , you know , it 's all family centered anyway ,
and another thing to think about , uh , on the positive side of the nursing homes here ,
i mean , you , i mean , it 's , it 's funny because technically you do .
men have a lot of trouble with that though .
because maybe they , those are not the clothes that are the most , uh , appealing to you , or the most , uh , complimentary to you .
and , uh , i , but i think that would , but as far as looking for a place , you know , i , the criteria , i mean , i think it 's very important to have very caring people , you know --
i guess , i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like i 'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon .
and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work .
but , it seemed kind of boring compared ,
you know , i mean you ca n't please them one way or the other .
everybody 's got that .
uh , starving to death is not a , not a whole lot of fun either
but that would come down .
i mean as far as selecting , selecting a school , i , i , i feel that , uh , a lot of it depends upon the major .
not very , not very long ago , seemed like the whole world , not just the united states , but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in , uh , you know , a very comfortable position , so to say , even though the , the cold war was , was in full swing . you know ,
and it 's just causing chaos
and , uh , there are a lot of things to think about
i think they underestimate how much , how much value the satisfaction
it was like a big marshmallow .
well , you sound like you 're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about ,
but lord knows you sh- , one should n't say that .
it would be ridiculous .
or how you could afford it .
i 'm convinced that the small v eight like the , the mustang 's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes ,
peer group is the other way now instead of ,
something giving you some affection as well .
but , uh , having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there , uh , is investing in the air force ,
mumblex and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially . as , as an instrument of u s policy .
and the young people are overly impressed .
uh , if there 's something you want to know , it 's , it 's in the times and then , and in detail .
i think it 's , uh , a good idea .
but they 're still fighting about it because of the --
you have to work at it .
you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf .
i think that , uh , my own interest in , in development , human development --
and if , they should pay for it with their life .
and if it 's ten and twenty it 's not too bad ,
but at least the wheels are moving forward .
you do n't see that much .
well , that certainly would be a wonderful , comfortable machine to take on long trips --
so , i think that 's som- , th , something that couples need in going --
but it 's , it 's coverage , you know .
you buy a quart of milk ,
not enough people want to do that to ,
what we consider just , i do n't , normal everyday things to them is real luxury .
-- and that , that would be great ,
oh , he , he he gave it ,
they pull the strings .
we almost have too much .
well , and you 're tempted if you 've got cash , a little bit of cash , and you do n't have enough for the purchase , right .
i really do . in , in a major way because they just , um , that whole region over there , i think needs to settle its own differences within itself .
you know , he was n't necessarily for iraq
i think that it has to really hit home before ,
the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much .
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that 's what everybody else assumes they are going to get .
well , they might tell you it 's random .
-- i think , i think , looking at athletes being drug tested --
if you just have people your own age , you never get a chance to see kids or anything --
and he just , he did not want to be in it any more than , than what we started out in august with desert storm .
but , if there are some people who do n't agree --
i guess i 'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football .
that 's funny .
i , i could just picture wha , what 's going to happen here in the not to distant future .
you know , i- , it , they should have , they should have the same rights as anyone else --
the , i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it 's across the board from , from the janitors to the executive management .
but once they get established , then it 's a money saving thing .
that 's always the way to do it .
too many times students get diagnosed as mo- , slow learners ,
oh , um , i think he 's got good intentions ,
well , not everything
but , uh , i think once you 're set in your ways , you 're set in your ways .
well , taco bueno 's good .
but it 's in spiritual kingdoms , and that the real warfare is done , you know , in your prayer closet , on your knees .
but i do n't think that they 're going , they 're going to change that ,
but , but , with the persian gulf , as you said , it 's just , uh , been very quiet .
i guess if this is the only place you 've lived , lubbock is a lot different than dallas .
i guess if you 're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences .
but i 'd , i also feel , as you said , that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup , uh , back , uh , in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today 's standard of living and the , the , uh , level of education of them , of so many people now , uh ,
boy , it is a big problem ,
i think we fulfilled our obligation .
and but it , but it is easy to get into a credit card problem ,
and , uh , there 's usually nobody running against , you know , the incumbents .
and so , uh , there 's a lot of money to be made there ,
now the lexus are very nice looking cars ,
well i guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory ,
uh , but you know a proposal to , uh , uh , i guess the proper authorities ,
they are to be there ahead of time , you know ,
it 's just , it 's the morals of the people which , i mean , i guess we , everybody 's responsible for the society ,
and i think that 's one of the , uh , the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is , you know , do you have the room for this dog to run around ,
i think that 's where it stems from , is that and , um , you know , you 've got a lot of , a lot more women that are working nowadays --
i think it 's mainly , people , like , they get the vengeance of it .
i think that might be true .
and especially when the weather 's not too hot or ,
and they , uh , uh , and they have a good time and everything
and they , in my opinion , do n't do a very responsible job --
-- you know , they 're convenient , you know ,
everyone thinks taxes are too high i 'm sure .
uh , but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when , when you start using more than a few --
so , you know , it was n't really worth it to him to do , to do it .
people are ,
well , you know , if you 've ever gotten anything , you know , in your life , your , your name is somewhere .
but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid .
in the longer term , uh , we , we , we 'd do well , i think to make , to make , uh , reductions there .
i mean , just general society to ,
then it should happen ,
but , uh , wh- , whether they plea bargain or not , if they 're guilty of murder , they 're guilty of murder , you know .
they just give it ,
there should be some sort of a control on it .
but you 'd be surprised also how , much people watch you that even not , uh , participating in any type crime .
i mean , doctors routinely send people in for anything .
they 're going to get better .
and how much profit they 're making
i think , uh , uh , there 's a lot not to be said for credit
i think that 's when you , you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have .
well , i was going to say , it sounds like you , you picked out a lot of good things , you know , for him , to , to , uh , to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it .
and i think , uh , overall that 's an , an excellent opportunity
they say mumblex is really frightening , too .
and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and , and things like that
the only consolation is so many of the murders are , you know ,
this is going to be fun .
oh , it 's awful the first house .
but , i think that 's that is a big problem . the television
certainly something like day care at the work place --
and , and i suppose that there is , uh , justification for taking everybody if you take anybody .
i think that is just a hoot .
well , and too , you know , they can always be blaming the other person ,
i guess that 's the best i ever got was lousy .
of course , he 's breaking the law all the time ,
-- and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system .
-- and , and they 're contributing to the income besides .
and i , i think there 's a , a shadow of a doubt , you know , like with this , this guy in , in milwaukee .
but you might be right .
that 's also an invasion of privacy .
seems to be the hot one of , of today .
well just ridiculous .
it 's interesting
it 's one of things
but it is a good healthy , wholesome lifestyle , uh ,
i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways .
well , that 's probably influenced maybe a little bit .
i mean , the thing is is that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right ,
and the parents are saying , hey , wait a minute ,
well , you know , you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house .
you know , an , an , i , i think that , um ,
really sad .
-- so depending on what your major is , or medical , you might want to atteck , some , um , attend somewhere like tech --
but , i mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched .
get you a little mumblex plaque .
it 's not like , like driving a little sports car .
they ca n't survive .
and they 're , and they 're doing the same , uh , or carrying the same job responsibility --
uh , but , uh , it could be better ,
and , i 'll go for like two weeks and go , this is for the birds ,
something that i feel is a , is a , pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that 's really so common that it 's accepted as the norm now , is the op , the open office concept .
but it , it 's not worth somebody getting executed for .
and looks uh , that the joining of forces for this , uh , uh , desert shield and desert storm thing ended up being a positive thing .
you know , if it 's going to get me , it 's get me .
you know , that , that 's , that 's scary too .
i , i do n't , i do n't think it 's really to their best interests ,
i think people just started , you know , no- , not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever , you know , whenever they gave them out .
that was a really good movie .
and , you know , there is just , i think it 's just trouble waiting to happen .
the photographers just got --
that would , that would be much .
well this has been an interesting conversation .
that --
service is more of a problem .
why i , i 'm , i 'm a little concerned about today is that this , uh , rather , uh , quick and , and easy , i do n't know , i should n't say easy , rather quick victory in the , in , in the , uh , mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe .
but whereas like in , uh , a person that , uh , stud- ,
you know , there 's no point in , you know ,
i mean ,
and if they kept it up ,
it 's interesting
i guess you read sports illustrated
you can make laws against corruption .
but when you get two strikes on you , you have a tend- , you know , you should , you know , shorten your swing a little bit , you know ,
and really , for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent .
and in our society , uh , there 's very little full employment .
it seems only fair .
i think it 's time that we start looking at , uh , getting into that .
and they try to solve them and everything ,
and then --
-- i mean , it 's just , i think that eventually , you know , the better people have sensibilities
scary ,
you were n't sure exactly how it would get there ,
they sort of threw the thing back another , you know , ten years ,
i do n't know how , uh , people , uh , that have young kids working work full time and , and do it , really , without being stressed out all the time .
uh , it 's just , you know , does n't seem to have enough story to it .
and , uh , kids eat funny .
that 's another consideration .
no big elaborate laws that say , uh , you know , call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review .
so that 's a good move , on , on gorbachev 's part in doing that .
it 's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity , and --
it 's pretty sad to think , uh , about those who , even today , are graduating from school
well that 's funny ,
there 's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere .
yet , your absolutely right .
so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils ,
and it would have make it , uh , broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for , i thought --
but it 's a lot to put into one .
you ,
but i thought , it 's good that , you know ,
might make you feel better
and , you know , in some sense , m- , the moderates may be right .
but with this peace dividend , it seems like you could set up some kind of like --
support the church instead .
i mean , it 's just the amount that you 're overspending ,
and i 'm not , um , totally innocent of that because ,
today 's , uh , means of communication , we could , a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information .
and , and , you 're never quite sure ,
and they get together
because i think that they are pretty vocal about it in , in , uh , africa .
we should have discussed this earlier ,
i think it 's , i think what 's interesting is that , uh , the political activists , jesse jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating .
because if , uh , kids do n't look up to you , or , or , ca , ca n't feel they can spend time with you , they 're going to find someone else --
well , the only thing that we can do as citizens is , you know , like , uh , watch groups that they 'll have .
parents are n't parents any more .
and the problem with reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich .
you just felt , gee , if i were n't here ,
you can look at it , you know ,
so they ,
i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer .
i , i would n't if i did n't have this car time ability probably --
you know , arnold schwarzenegger is getting to be , uh , a bit of a variety actor , you know .
and there 's probably thousands of holes in that theory ,
well , i have a hun- , i have a hunch that , you know , the other prisoners are n't going to be too happy with him anyway . either ,
that 's the hardest thing i think , you know --
we really have to do more ,
i thinks it 's a marvelous activity for younger families because , uh ,
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is .
and , uh , because if you have , you know , two , well , if you go to work , you 're , just working to pay for day care ,
and they 've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage .
it 's a hundred meter .
so , it 's , it 's really kind of crazy .
i do n't believe that anybody should die --
that sounds like an interesting concept .
and so they can almost always find room for someone like that .
but you , you 're doing it for fun .
i think . it 's very cold .
but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours .
but , uh , most of the time they do n't with , when , follow books very well when they make them into movies .
but i do n't think they could cover everything that you could teach ,
put people into , you know , january or february which is always suppose to be ,
today the turks , uh , agreed to support the kurds , which is something they 've never done before
or anyway it was , it was difficult .
and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too
but it , it really does n't take their pain away .
oh , they should definitely get , um , the nickel returnable .
but there 's not enough .
but we 've kind of driven these people out .
but --
and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs ,
they have induced it themselves .
well , you know , the , uh , uh , the world is changing f- , uh , from instit- , from , uh , industrial , uh , base to , uh , information base
well , i 'm not real sure that 's , that 's appropriate .
it , and it does n't seem to get much better for the exempts either , unless you 're twenty-eight or above .
because they were like oh , well , we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it .
and say just do this .
they do n't , they do n't seem to , well ,
and then , i think , you know , all that falling would warm it up and melt it ,
it 's not just like one instance , or something , it 's just , uh , horrifying , some of the murders that go on .
but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from , or beat to death
well , the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the --
uh , i think that , uh , in such cases , uh , they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased .
i , i ca n't see paying an annual fee for it .
i guess it 's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy .
because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you --
maybe i- , well , maybe that was , um ,
well there 's , there 's all sorts of scare tactics , i guess , to , to invade our privacy
and it does n't allocate resources oftenly because there is a tendency , uh , at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills ,
uh , i , i think that in some cases that 's considered to prejudice the current case --
with kids they do n't care , you know , uh , a l- , about a lot of things .
any t- , any team that , tha , where the owner would fire tom landry , you know , is like one of the greatest coaches of all time .
but i would think they would get a much greater turnover
they have been .
so , maybe that 's part of the reason it 's not so bad down here .
it 's just such a huge expense
you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy , too ,
i thought that might be kind of fun to do .
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country .
uh , but i really think it 's important to put these children someplace where , in addition to , you know , them getting an education , they really need a , you know , a socialization away from what they are raised in .
-- and i think this is b- , really --
and , uh --
i get things done faster , than when i 'm in a dress and heels , you know ,
and , you know , the , the problem in the work place is that , that people are ,
well , it puts a strain on everybody , your wife and your family .
i think that , uh , we , we ,
so really if your sitting in the back seat , your better off not not to have your seat belt on , if it 's just a seat belt .
and it 's probably not a great investment ,
i mean , you know , i , i think we made a wrong choice when i look at the children of today .
and so , basically no one was taking the responsibility --
and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people 's responsibilities .
it 's what 's happening in the families .
uh , sometimes when i hear what , what they 're , even what , even what the politicians are making , you know , when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that , uh , i think that 's just a bit too much to be paying them , uh ,
it would , it would be pirated
as far as capital punishment , i think that , uh , ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment .
there 's really a disparity between the , uh , what a e- , i would call civilization of the countries , you know .
the characters played very well off one another .
i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen .
so i 'm no- , i 'm , uh , think that the , we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that , uh , for texas
but it 's , it 's a lot like camping .
not , not a real in depth topic , but --
but i am more productive when i 'm in pants .
you ca n't take them for a walk ,
i , uh , i think if somebody 's not on drugs , they have no reason , you know , to be afraid of it .
t v watching has sure has n't gone too much out the door because t v is still , well ,
and i thought it was pretty normal ,
i mean , sure , the payroll is lower that way ,
of course , you have n't lived until you have been to san antone , to the ,
uh , you know , they 're constantly ,
and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it .
we suspect that he was hurt in an accident , you know , got away from somebody traveling through , and hurt in an accident --
a , a , the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who 's good and who 's bad
i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it .
so , i do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor .
there is n't going to be any of this , you know , very few people will ever stay home .
well , i think too ,
lessons are expensive though .
oh , that 's really sad .
so , i guess we 're old timers compared to some people .
there 's something about , um , the industry in the state ,
it 's what many people have done already , who were just less famous .
and they do n't know a lot about that .
i think it 'll only make them worse ,
but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of texas in the summer
i just think it , it 's , it 's a duty of the parent to do that .
and i do not think , i do not know , i think today a lot of parents , um , are ruled by their kids .
but i mean , but --
if i do n't think see , if i do n't believe that there 's not a character change and the authorities agree , that this person needs to be excused , i believe for murder , uh , rape , i even believe incest , things ,
and it 's really , really kind of a neat thing to do .
they seem to be having a real good response .
i , i thought the fall was really nice .
more women in upper management
and it 's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things .
and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad ,
it 's a tough , tough question .
because health care insurance for , for everyone is skyrocketing
and it 's like the , the truth is n't really important anymore .
you know , they feel like they 've lived life
uh , you know , it invades my time .
uh , it 's just , you know , it 's so low
people do n't want to take responsibility .
so , it fills you up
the interest is so low .
this is kind of neat .
i know we could .
uh , football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world .
you know , it 's all , it 's all money now .
well , if nobody , yeah , if nobody complains you 're all right .
and if ,
i understand that the macneil lehrer probably does n't .
i , i think our experience of camping is ,
i mean there are some people ,
that , that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game .
and i keep thinking , you know , it 's not , it 's really not too late at any point to do , you know , some- ,
take a long time to find the right place
he 's just there to serve his time , and get back out on the street .
i mean , they , they find out whether , just how much of a people person they are .
you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat , because they 'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we 're melting ,
but , um , i think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes
they just did n't seem , they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
the world does revolve around d c , you know --
and that 's where , uh , leaders can use , uh , use that whenever the opportune moment arises .
it 's , uh , it 's , it 's different .
the pay is n't fabulous ,
it 's amazing .
i mean , uh , you know , you ca n't live in dallas without , you know ,
still have a problem with , uh ,
but as it was , the politicians ran the , the korean conflict and ultimately the vietnam thing ,
it 's kind of sad that i 've let that slip away .
i do n't think , i do n't think they have the right to do that .
you need to really , uh ,
as long as you 're sort of safely removed from it , it seems , seems not so , so bad , i guess .
but , i , i think that 's a small , uh , number could ,
i think it was campinas ,
but i think that was an actu- , actually a good thing that happened , uh , i never considered it , i guess , it 's an invasion of your privacy
i mean it 's just , it 's that mind-set ,
a lot of those are really violent type movies .
once a year you go out
and they abuse that .
uh , the communists are the , all alleged democrats . uh ,
you just assume .
and i think ,
i think that is a , a positive thing for them after , um , uh , thousands of years ,
uh , as i understand it , and i , uh , do n't know a lot about it , uh , we got in there because of france --
well , um , individual companies and things are so selfish ,
once you find the doctor that you like it 's not a problem .
but that , i mean , that can really benefit .
and it 's a matter of your taste , uh ,
i notice locally a major problem is kodak .
um , there 's , there 's different value placed on human life ,
you ca n't really unless your child would be old enough to say something ,
-- and well , you know , the war riots , of course .
and , about had to be something like that getting around in a pinto .
and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were , uh , controlled and , and , uh , transcontinental or , um , um , interstate , uh , trucking .
you ca n't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it .
sounds like something i should do .
it has a magic with numbers .
he 's so prolific .
it 's the chicken and the egg thing .
or certain privileges come from voting which are n't that important but are nice to have ,
madonna --
the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with , uh , the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person .
mumblex it really makes an effort on , to ,
that means you 're a real cook .
and not all of those are necessities .
that 's excellent advice .
but they , you know , if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school --
i 'd certainly , uh , support israel in , in their , their policy that in defending themselves and in , uh , in their handling of their foreign policy ,
or to rehab after , uh , an illness .
well , you learn a lot going to the juries like that though .
i think --
i mean , i , i suppose that , that it 's difficult to really say why because , uh , you know , there , there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified .
in the summer , that 's great .
i 'm not sure about requiring it , you know , of people , because people are going , you know , feeling resentful .
you know , it 'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it .
if they sink --
the buffalo scene in that thing --
i ,
well i can see it in certain cases where it might be , uh , somebody 's in a position that , uh , perhaps a lot of lives are involved , like , maybe , uh , pilots that , uh , you know , fly jets
takes a heck of a long time , i guess , to get there --
and , uh , and also , um , uh , i think that , uh , a certain percentage of , uh , the colleges produce a fairly de- , uh , public colleges produce a fairly decent student ,
but it 's a , that is a particularly neat area for camping because ,
and even , you know , i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of , kind of play a good part in our changes
i think it 's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us
things like that have to be planned ,
and then ,
and i think it 's the same with your characters on t v .
none of it 's probably damaging , lot of times .
i think it kind of washes down from , uh , from your area linda .
but does n't have the loans with the credit union , they 're offering something that might be worth --
but they 're making money --
you know , and if you did away with some of that , our postal service might give better service .
uh , so i gue , you know , i guess it works , uh , much like , uh , well , shoot , like any lottery ,
and it , it will never change about that place .
but , but there are --
i wish that when they sentence someone , if they 're going to sentence him to five years , then make him serve five years .
they put those on .
and i guess i would like ,
i think it 's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is , percent .
that 's makes people resentful too .
true we do have completely different ways of looking at things , at a lot of things ,
and i think a lot of people who do it now .
you 've moved almost , moved around as much as i have .
sooner or later they 'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way .
there was that , uh , you know , there was really the period that was going on there ,
but , um , you know , it , you just feel like it 's out of control .
i 'm not sure , though , when we talk about what rules , if any , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have to be tested .
and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be , may be a good investment .
and , uh , you have to be more flexible and more willing to , uh , uh , adjust to other people 's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things .
so , well , this is an interesting topic ,
well , jean , we seem to be of the same opinions here .
oh , now that 's surprising --
i think particular boys that the maturity ,
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing , uh .
so --
and it 's depending on where you live , though , too .
and the hand eye coordination
you know , i mean , if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter , i mean , there 's , they make all these people out to be , oh ,
and they 're is just no styling to them ,
i do n't think it 's going to happen either ,
but , that 's the type of thing they understand .
well , i think so ,
i mean , it needs to be , you know ,
we tried .
uh , because it was a life threatening situation , it was very good .
in a way , it 's almost like he had so much debt that , uh , filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it --
i can see where that would n't be very good for a , a kid , you know ,
it 's not ,
something 's wrong .
it would be a lot better .
well i think they 're going to have ,
seems like every time somebody 's on the bank , all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can --
probably a lot more civilized , more , um , refined than a lot of the people would be down here .
they 're very expensive .
-- i believe that truck drivers and people that have ,
you could probably just , you know ,
improve it if we can , if we ever get a chance .
and , and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about , rethought .
oh , well , it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway .
uh , i think what is really important , uh ,
especially when they get like into the teenage stage .
there are issues that , you know , as far as , like , equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff , i totally am for .
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country , supposedly u s or russia attacks a country , it 's not going to be within the borders of the u s or russia itself .
driving for thanksgiving , that 's going to be quite a drive for ,
i , i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was .
but we needed that .
they should be though .
it 's amazing what a minivan can do .
you know , that 's , that 's no kind of deterrent because we , we 've got literally hundreds of people on death row , and , and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years --
if it 's related to the crime , they should be able to .
um , . i think it depends on if you want to be a , if you want a regional job or a national job ,
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late .
and on whole o- , i would say that they 're equal to , uh , most of our competitors .
-- and i do n't think that they really realize that death is forever , you know .
we will never know .
but see they 're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what , you know , the issues that people really want to know about , because on those issues you have to say yes or no .
and it 's just , uh , if there were more than one child , i do n't know , the- , there would be no way to do it .
i mean ,
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent
so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world .
now star trek is good movies , good shows .
and then it comes down to the dollar .
and a lot of people do n't do that either .
and it 's a great stress , stress reliever .
but --
and especially if you have a family .
those are nice .
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to , uh , what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh ,
but , you know , that it is incredible , you know .
and the actual play time that there is --
so , i , i think by now , it 's a matter of , uh , personal taste .
because ,
and , uh , it 's usually not a very smooth ,
and interest rates are n't none too shallow these days anyway .
there 's lots and lots of volunteer programs
basically the people ,
so , it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years ,
and , and also , uh , the , the issues they deal with , uh , really tends to open , open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems .
seems like a , a lot of people do n't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to .
it was important de , demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments .
it 's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you 're doing something productive ,
it 's , uh , that 's one of the biggest concerns .
but i just think it is kind of a shame that , uh , you still hear things about the children that are orphans there
where the wife has gone to school , you know --
but --
they 've been really holding out in the legislature ,
but --
but you still better have the key players in place , if something does go down . even if it 's a regional conflict .
they may have , uh , just plain parental leave , which either one can take .
i , i , i think it 's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days .
the cats are so independent
they quit buying it .
you see more of that , you see more of them , uh , leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel , too .
and i 'm sure that any of them would have cost al- , or charged me almost the same amount .
because that 's one thing that 's hard , with young people , you , you ca n't tell them how things are --
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up .
and i think maybe with dallas , as far as , they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first .
as long as you do not have to drive in it .
and they wo n't raise our taxes .
i think gorbachev has about had his day .
i do n't think it 's going to be that easy to come up with --
i think the taxes have just , every time you turn around they , they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products ,
but i do n't think it 's too good .
and it also builds too much mass if you just , you know .
fees that , that fund these things , i guess that 's trickled down to the states
uh , and , and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one
that was a good one .
well i know how you feel .
and they need that .
you know , but , gosh it 's , uh , it 's getting pathetic now .
uh , i think they 're handy .
it 's going to take , uh , you know ,
i guess so .
but , um , it looks like it would hold the soil
and i mean all guys , i think , like to barbecue .
some of the things that would make sense to , to tell the jury , that this , this guy has a , a prior cri , criminal history , you know , where he 's raped ten women --
they , they no longer feel it 's , uh , it 's no big deal to , to stay home and raise your family --
-- i do n't , i do n't think that you can have , i mean , there 's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i want to be --
more --
you know , kind of like the bermuda triangle ,
i do n't know why we are so complacent ,
ten years ago was n't so hard to stay up .
but i think you put your finger on it , when you said that they 're not respected if they do n't work , because it seems to me that a lot of people i know , women i know , are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense , certainly financially --
and then they shoot someone else
and , uh ,
it would be handy .
that 's a lot easier .
there 's should be , you know , this , for this crime , this is the penalty .
i think the problem is , you know ,
and i think , you know that ,
oh , well , at least you know you did your part .
but what you do n't forget is the growing up .
and , and it 's --
and then , uh , we , we go on from there
so that 's kind of a pain .
but --
if you are doing a lot of things , sometimes you have conflicts ,
i mean i guess you could take those off too
you know , they could n't even take handoffs .
um , well , they must ,
and , uh , that 's not the idea .
you know , if you 're , you 're drinking or on drugs or whatever , you 're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands .
the cleaning up can be a mess .
that 's , uh , motivating .
and --
if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that , it works out fine .
and , and , maybe arriving late or something like that , you know ,
oh , go , in going to school , you get taught the things you learn in school ,
-- and then when they get out , they ,
we 're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager .
like sometimes when americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt american things , americanism , um , consumer products , t v , the whole works .
but , they 're retired , you know ,
and the medical is just , i mean , i think it 's terrible , you know ?
he will enjoy williams i think and mumblex is a good academic ,
it 's real aggravating ,
if you 're a fan you got to stay with the team any way , you know , you --
it seems like , uh , older people have much better , uh ,
uh , so they p- , they , they want , you know , they want the best
-- i think it was too extreme .
i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people , you know , special interest groups can blow up ,
at least we found something different .
it could still happen then .
the aids issue is , is a bit of a problem .
i think they 're doing pretty well this year though .
they do n't like to be absent before a vacation .
so it 's real hard to ,
and , uh , uh , so they 're not exactly business men .
but those are the ones that are complaining , i , i think , a lot .
so --
but , uh ,
we can have a debate .
at least for a lot of women --
i guess we 're on .
and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably , believe it or not , is just to get the extra nickel at the , uh , the store and not , uh ,
and one is education for civilization .
but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise .
if , it 's , it 's interesting .
it 's a big problem
just take all these civil service employees ,
it is just a matter of , uh , time and mistakes
but i think you you really hit the nail on the head .
because if he 's interested , he 's going to study it ,
i mean obviously you can look at it and say well , anyway .
i , i , i truly believe that , that before that , that we have to address the racial , racial issues in the united states ,
people , people 's personal schedules are so busy .
i think we are getting ,
that 's amazing .
i , i think i 'll enjoy .
they say a million people are infected --
that they would , um , kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there ,
and even in that situation , uh , the , it seems like to me from what i 've read in , in the history of russia and , and you know different authors , uh , there has always been a paranoia .
i guess probably since about eighty-four , about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really ,
a three to four for eighty dollars .
you 'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care .
that 's not their problem ,
and , but if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive , i mean , there 's revolution . you know ,
and they 're always over in someone else 's house .
like i say , it 's a broad category ,
well , it was nice today .
but ,
but that ,
but when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going to lay down , i think that , uh , that they should .
-- and so there 's , uh , there 's plenty of scholarships out there ,
they do n't take any stands on anything .
that there 's the t- , upper management that always wears gray suits .
but the point is is that businesses do that .
but when you start getting into colors ,
but on the other hand , it 's , it 's also saying that white jurors are not going to , are not going to convict .
um , we 're probably one of the , the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have .
which could be another mumblex of monty python .
it makes you wonder .
they 're just looking what 's going to pay the biggest cash .
i got a little sick of his mug on the screen every ,
i think a lot of people grow up with , uh , with , uh , preconceived notions li- , what the world 's about .
but , but the other side to that is , if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , or , you know , and somehow redeem himself .
because they do know , you know ,
you ca n't really run away from the problem --
and , he can even be in movies that are not , uh , uh , sexually oriented ,
so many of the churches have really strong --
they 've got so many different things with it now .
well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such . i think there ought to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this .
if it 's hot , you ca n't do that .
that 's the only way they 're going to fund it , because if they start raising taxes for property , and people are going to throw a fit .
you know , typically , you , if you purchase your own car you tend to make , uh , the best returns after you pay it off .
you know , because your b m w -s , your german cars have good reputations , i think .
i , i do n't think under the way the system is right now , it is .
it 's hard to talk for five minutes on this .
you clip recipes
the food is great .
i , that 's something that comes from your old age , you know .
and , uh , it was a good game .
i mean , you know , because it takes a lot of hard work .
and it is so overacted that you 're just hysterical --
you know , that , that 's what 's they 're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow .
they 'll , they 'll stock your house and , uh , look at your pattern and then go from there .
and the , the problem with that is then , then , then people will either , the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or --
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there .
and i hope it keeps ,
but i think it might be them .
and , uh --
and it , it handled real well ,
and the broken families .
the thing i do n't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek ,
i think that 's really , uh , really important .
well , it 's real pretty ,
except they ,
and now , it 's , it 's kind of your final choice .
and --
i think it 's just playing now up here .
oh , those are wonderful are n't they .
-- you know , you do n't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult .
but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force .
well , but in general i think it 's a good idea because --
but they 're not speaking for me .
because it 's too much trouble to try and catch up ,
it 's a fantastic experience .
but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and ,
and there 's a big difference .
i guess this does n't really have to do with taxes but just money in general , and , and , um , wondering if you 're going to have enough when you retire to live on .
especially in this day and age .
well , uh , i guess if they 'll replace them , then they assume they should n't have broken .
and it 's going to be worse .
i mean looking at it from the am , the american public 's standpoints , they do n't understand the middle easterners .
i mean , and that 's not really the answer , i mean , because if they 're alcoholics they 'll just go out and spend ,
that might be a step in the right direction .
but sometimes i think tend to hold a little bit of it in , you know .
and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved , then it 's nobody 's business .
kind of interesting , uh , the people down here typically do n't think it gets above , you know , fifty degrees .
they have to just go through everything .
that 's , uh , that was a really good movie .
jeez and you ca n't take the chances .
and she , and she met in a safe setting , such as church .
it just really was n't worth it .
and i think that 's the difficulty they , that , that we have that , uh , it , it reality does n't make , uh , does n't make any difference if he has no income .
you know , from what i pick up on the news , uh , it 's a difficult process , you know , to get rid of a , a bad mayor .
and i really feel that we have to do something in order to , uh , to mumblex ,
you know , would you give in .
well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though , you know .
you can have it come on just early in the morning .
but it 's pretty hard to think that , you know , people are just going to shoot each other down
it seems like there 's , it seems that there 's a grass roots , um , effort or whatever going on
you ca n't do this after twenty , you know
it 's kind of hard to always feel , gosh ,
and they , they thwarted the robbery attempt .
-- so , usually is --
and most of them now , you know , you do n't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that 's all solid state or ,
i mean , that 's tough .
i feel like that might be better , if it was run on a more scriptural basis , which would include , you know , you know , and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with .
the police do n't catch them ,
that cuts into our free time right there .
uh , i do n't think they should abolish it .
there 's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for .
well it goes all through the st- , it goes all through the state supreme court system before they 're ,
i guess that 's not a big surprise .
the gramm rudman act did n't solve the problem .
and , and most of them are n't .
uh , perhaps we 'll finally get the youth weaned off of it .
in other words , they just prioritize their lives differently .
we 've just been taken out from under , under a law .
and the government really plays a role in this .
because if , if she had offered to stay home we would n't have thought anything stran ,
it 'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the , this opposition will , uh , uh ,
flowery shirt , shorts , camera hanging around their neck , you know , demanding this , that and the other thing , you know ,
there 's definitely problems ,
and , uh , it grows , uh ,
-- you probably do n't have to do much over there ,
and that is kind of steep ,
and that 's , it 's really too bad --
and the idea is to , is and good ,
assuming you can buy into global warming i bi- ,
that does n't go along with camping ,
that 's a good idea .
they are probably going to miss the person
it , it is , it 's mind bog , you know , well , you know ,
i do too . uh , because it does n't make any difference , uh , uh , whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun , i suppose .
i , i feel like that there 's going to be , uh , less crime
and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points , you know , mumblex hundred twenty-two , you know ,
it 's a little bit financial type thing
i , i , i 'd force them .
one of the things that i found interesting last year during the , uh , the gulf conflict was a sentiment against , uh , peter arnett , who had stayed in iraq and was presenting , uh , some of the things that were available .
well , i would think he would .
there 's a lot out there to see ,
you , you do have to figure it out .
um , i guess , you know , we 'd have a lot of aid , if , if you consider the inner cities of like new york and , and how much aid it needs .
that was , that was a big thing with him .
and then the river was really nice because it was n't too frightening ,
college is not for everybody .
i had dinner monday night with a vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had .
that would be cool sometime if i could , you know , work up to that .
usually with you life in some places .
uh , it just did not seem that , uh , i do not know , technically we knew what we were doing either .
and , you know , it , it 's pretty cute .
get them out there ,
i mean , they become well known .
there 's there 's always that difficulty
i think if we could send her someplace for the day --
it 's , it 's , it 's , it 's pretty good .
sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that .
but , you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off .
or you go you know --
he really is gosh .
people are crazy .
well you know if we can keep them in school .
i know we use them for trash can liners and --
you know , it 's , it 's pretty nice and friendly out there --
and , and it decreases the prison population .
that keeps the christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray , because that does affect that things , you know , in your background .
it 's , it 's a complicated issue .
well , that was pretty courageous .
i- , i- , they were very good at first ,
you know , i mean , mumblex as far as i 'm considered , she was in violation
i do n't have any idea .
they get so much of our money from oil anyway .
in colorado it 's interesting .
that 's like forcing someone to donate to a charity .
we just function differently .
-- but then , you do n't want to go do that when you do n't have to --
it 's great .
-- it 's just , you know , another killing .
and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing ,
they do n't do as much .
i mean , it does ,
you do n't get those .
i feel guilty we do n't recycle our , our milk containers because they seem like a big waste .
and , uh , given the , the , uh , military powers on both sides , i think it 's always a threat .
it 's a little early .
you ca n't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well .
you know , i , i , i think there 's something about being able to , to claim , um , imminent danger
but , you know , the instant thing may be , may , may be the way of the future to , you know , to replace checks and every other thing .
and i think they should be voted on by the public .
and i think , personally , the drastic step has to be that , um , that you ca n't work if you continue taking drugs .
there has to be consideration taken on everything .
it 's one of the problems .
i think so .
it might be more ,
and if not , you know , do n't , do n't let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years .
and it , it is a beautiful country .
and then if you 're a computer operator and , uh , there 's really no big deal ,
and , uh , i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level , you know , rather than just in the places where it 's , you know , where it 's predominated so far , because it 's , you know it 's --
and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun , if that five day waiting period were in effect , you would n't be able to purchase one at that gun show .
and it 's interesting to see them as they get older , uh , then that is the type of adult they are .
well that takes all the work out of it .
-- and it 's , it 's , well , it 's a little bit , i do n't want to use the word wilder , that 's not the word i want . um , more diverse ,
i think that 's one reason we have problems in schools , uh ,
and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times .
but i do n't think , uh , anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they 've been messing it up for many years , now .
i think that 's why a lot of people go to see him , though .
that , that , that , that , that 's , that 's the way it works there , um .
well , it 's so much money
any , any kind of drug use on , on company property and whatnot ,
he was very good for lubbock when he came to , you know ,
some do horrible , you know , until they get to like tenth grade ,
not everybody can play hockey .
but , uh , you just , you know , you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs .
it 's really , it 's a bad thing ,
it 's , it just practically do n't get any .
then we will be forced to .
and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging .
you do get an education , you do learn some things ,
maybe it just depends on , you know , how closely the crime , you know ,
i think it 'd be interesting --
there 's been a real revival in mexico city since that earthquake , because there 's a lot of , you know there 's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot , lots of witchcraft , a lot of witchcraft . a whole lot of witchcraft .
oh , dana , i think we have probably conversed long enough .
you 're either liberal or you 're conservative ,
as soon as they get elected , the people dump all kinds of money on them and say , yeah , yeah , you 're my friend ,
and i guess you 're eligible after twenty-seven for parole , even though you 're in for life .
i think they have a really good , uh , quality .
and it was interesting that they think that they 're basically impartial .
and you just ca n't enjoy it unless you 've got a good sound system to produce all the ,
you 're just going to have to talk to it --
the young people are n't getting the proper care that they need , and nutrition , i think ,
so we have to , uh , face that reality also .
it 's , it 's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car ,
you know , you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property .
yo- , you have to support the people that are there .
so , i mean , it 's , it 's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards .
you know like people that are in prison , i mean we did n't put them there .
well and that , i think that 's maybe part of it that , that the , um ,
well , i think that 's important for your budget to be realis ,
and i think locking them up for , you know , fifty years does n't do a , any good because --
they use the , they use the insides of the animals , heart and liver
well , he could always get past , you know , he 'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone .
but i think if we can , if we can expand the men 's roles at the same time , like you 're taking care of your child , and your dad probably did n't very often --
uh , and one way you know that is that only god can afford it .
you know , i guess if you consider the two problems , drug addiction and aids --
you 're working ,
and it 's hard on women .
the , the violent people going against each other
that 's like , oh , i can do that .
people are just totally unfeeling .
and the hardware , well , i mean , all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity
you , you do n't have to worry about filling out forms , uh , you know , for reimbursement and all or , you know , getting paid eight percent of , of whatever .
i think more the mice or other rodents .
so you ca n't do much about that .
there needs to be more than one test ,
it just seems so sad to have to only rely on , you know , college football .
the national debt is terrible .
at first he was just a big muscle man .
but there 's ,
but , i think we 're doing better and better all the time ,
you know , he 'd , uh , never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy .
they sort of candy coated the western story for many years ,
and , and that , i think has been the downfall of the last ten years .
and that , that has to do with , you know , the women getting out and other women seeing , uh , women seeing other women , you know ,
and you have to , you know , be familiar with it ,
i , i just think it makes honest people more honest
well , i guess that 's god 's place , too .
it 's an adjustment to make , also .
you got to have , uh , six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars .
that 's the way they suck you in .
which of course he needed .
but as the years go on , if you 're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better
and there might be a revolution within the people .
i think that 's a lot of it too , is that people need to teach their kids ,
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while , what percentage of them would actually say , hey , that 's not a bad way to do it ,
well , part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper .
because it , uh , it seems like everybody has a , you know , to go in and do ,
the- , they should be able , they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
he 's a very good writer
i mean it would be --
i know --
i agree with you .
i think clearly , the person who is the line own- , the line manager --
so all the dieters would be happy .
and you need a special nursing home for that .
but there 's probably at least about twenty-five to , to thirty cents of different taxes on , on our gas .
but i think by the time they 're , oh , early teenagers anyway , i think it 's too late now . at least around here .
so if someday we can go to jeff dahlmer and say , well , the problem is you , you 've got an endorphin imbalance
actually , they 're showing remarkable restraint .
we really have .
maybe there need to be some radical changes made .
but the story was a very dramatic story ,
um , i think that , and i think that involves social changes a lot .
and when someone is say , out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they 're not committed to huge amounts of debt , that 's the best time to be able to do work that does n't pay very well .
and , uh , uh , it 's a really good show .
that is cute .
but see , that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people . at people , per , at high school level ,
seems like sometimes hobbies do that .
but things are generally packaged in the english sized packages , you know .
-- but i think the quality of our , uh , our news is just , uh , i do n't believe it could be better --
-- uh , uh , you know , i guess , i guess when you start pitching real well , well , move them up . bam mumblex .
but , i think chicago will probably with the n b a again .
it 's funny .
i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school , then it 's like they 've lost so much ground , we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up , reteaching what they had the year before . you know .
but there 's a greater chance that he 'll be back out on the streets in twelve years .
and if i have a hard time , you know --
well , cathy , i think that , uh , capital punishment certainly has a place in our society , um , maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just ca n't afford to have repeated , even in the remote chance of repetition .
i think that , uh ,
i 'll bet that was the case of the , the war in the middle east .
they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years .
when in doubt , do n't trust the government at all .
sometimes you 're in the mood for it even .
and , um , i , i guess they would , would be more conservative , some of them i guess .
and that gives you so much basic knowledge that you do n't ask a whole lot of questions .
but , uh , during that time i 'm sure there 's hundreds of , uh , thousands of people that are , uh , spending money that does not belong to them .
and it was really an integral part ,
well , i was , i was , uh , originally chosen primarily , i think , because i was a young fellow
and it would have nothing to do with political situations .
not an uzi .
but , i , you know , you could n't deny that .
and that it 's mostly sales tax ,
i actually think that i 'm , i 'm somewhat encouraged by that trend , because after all people live longer lives now ,
it is a deterrent in the , in the sense that that person will never do it again .
we do n't have speedy , um , punishment
it 's frightening .
it 's dangerous for the woman , too , to think that she can do that
it kind of makes you feel mumblex from doing it again .
well , i think you hit on one point there is you know each other .
the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter
like you said , i mean , there 's , they might be saving money ,
the hostile planet , i think ,
especially , you know , if you catch yourself short on cash or if you 're on vacation ,
people marry later .
it 's not , not a real good one actually .
you ca n't really tell ,
and uh , you 're right , the leaves are beautiful ,
uh , they 're just too nice .
i , i agree with you that they 're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren ,
or it could be like the draft where , you know , before they draft you , they ta- , uh , you get a physical anyway .
oh , i thought it was awful ,
in , in terms of that , i think we 've got more of a sense of humor about each other --
you can talk about that a lot ,
it 's , it 's difficult ,
they have to kind of take a stand on some things , like abortion and things like that ,
but , you know , it 's like somebody said , okay as of such and such a date , you know , anybody caught talking in the english , you know ,
i guess that 's all right .
and we , uh , i think we over estimated it ,
well , another thing now they keep decontrolling different things .
but , i guess as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation --
those were not good cars .
we 've all got to do it right now .
that thing , that thing will last forever i mean ,
-- um , it 's not the same ,
oh sure i 'll be more then glad to pay him --
you 're missing an awful lot .
i mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it 's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to be , uh , as far as cash flow , a lot , uh , have be , tend to have a much slower cash flow --
and those are fun .
i mean if you look at the break down of those who do n't vote , they tend to be , you know ,
so , it , you know , it 's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos .
-- and , uh , i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days
seems kind of old to me .
and they are doing it un- , you know , unconsciously .
-- and , uh , i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand , you know , try to understand what they 're going through and everything and try to understand that --
you would look into it thoroughly and ,
you do n't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own , you know .
and you know , they , especially boys , i mean , they 're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff --
and that just really does aggravate me .
it 's a big problem .
if , if they have complications and ,
and it , it 's just too bad that we could n't see that .
it would n't be perfect ,
and it seems , uh ,
no one wants to be at downtown dallas much .
they 're really good cars .
that 's , that 's just the way it is .
it , it 's funny ,
and they 're back on the street
something 's wrong .
so --
my complaint would , would be , um , that i think that , you know , the kids in the neighborhood run wild ,
they do n't have anybody to depend on ,
well , i think that 's great .
that 's changing .
but , uh , you know , sometimes you do n't get tuned in to what 's going on .
well i mean i 've had some pretty bad , i guess some pretty controversial topics
it was much , much harder when mine were young .
that 's been a real big plus .
you know , you can go to the country club together .
their little minds are like sponges
so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes ,
oh , that 's good .
you , you pretty well know what you 're getting ahead of time ,
i do n't think the teachers get enough support , quite honestly .
when they 're so cheap too at the video stores that you can .
anyway , so you might as well not ,
and , you know , to , i 'm sure he gets to watch a lot of t v
you know , there are so many rip-off artists here in this town .
cause they look pretty rough .
but , you know , that 's not always a real , for sure kind of thing .
well i do n't think iran is under the same type of madman type leadership ,
i think socially , it really destroyed a lot of the people that , that went over and saw these people .
and , and there 's big differences , of course ,
well , this , this is a thing
and all the trees are pretty ,
well , that 's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes , too , i guess .
it 's more motivating that way , i think .
the perceived decline , has to do with , uh , um , the attitudes and the educational system , uh ,
and they can make , as you said , uh , so well , the , a , a few can make it so miserable for everybody else .
they just , um , make their , uh , circle and come back again .
and , and i mean , there is just no way i 've not picked one up .
well , if you 're from iowa , you must be very artsy crafty .
or if they would allow them to , uh , give broader answers , they ,
minivans d , do pretty well .
because i think our generation could make a change .
i guess maybe it would have been better if we 'd have been at the theater --
well , i suspect that it is possible .
and i do n't think it 's that different from what the baltic states are , are going through .
supposedly that 's supposed to catch it .
that 's okay , too .
and it is really frightening , uh , to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety .
he only has twenty , twenty-five , whatever hours he has to spend on practice .
in fact , just , uh , just , uh , sit and chat with them for five minutes and , and be interested in what they have to say --
it is a mental thing .
but it 's the phone calls ,
-- and then , you know , if it 's , uh , if they 're satisfied ,
and if you look at history at all , you see that , you know , uh , we go from one side to the other on just about any subject ,
he 's going to do what he wants to do .
i do n't , i do n't see any difference though ,
and , you know , even there you have to watch out for , you know ,
the other big change i see in , in woman 's lives is , um , to remain biological
now you understand .
somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries .
fifty-five gallons , you 'd hope it would never do that .
there 's more than one group fighting for the same place .
we have .
well , i think health care is real important , and dental coverage ,
but , uh , like you said , it 's , it 's not the best system ,
music is kind of in a weird , it 's in a very weird position right now .
and a lot of the , a lot of the myths they 've been passing around , people are starting to realize are n't true .
and i think that sometimes it 's too easy of a , i do n't know , to easy of an answer .
i , i have a feeling we 're going to go more and more ,
and i think i see some change in attitudes there .
you do n't get , seem to get that much for the space ,
we ca n't get involved in their civil war , um , unfortunately ,
well it 's interesting .
whenever you donate money to someone ?
you ca n't do that very often .
but , that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking --
i mean you look around
-- so it stands to reason they should really ha , have more benefits .
and your , your , your neighbor gets them ,
i think it 's interesting you we- , you know , when yo- , you go out there
and , uh , you know , having that , that , uh , gung ho plan --
a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs .
i think it 's , it 's more frequent now .
but , on the other hand , i do n't think it , you know , that someone that teaches , uh , say shop , for instance , should have to have degree at all .
i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits .
if you want a really special night out and fish food --
that 's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem .
whereas if you try something different , they 'll --
he has to do something positive to help them .
and in the heat of the moment , they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people ,
but that one just sounded like gossipy .
you , you get a little taste of it
and , there , there , they seem that the profit marg- , uh , drug dealers , the profit margin 's so high that , yeah --
because people think it does n't really cost them anything to pay .
and this is why , i mean , uh , drugs are the biggest problem , i think to face america today .
and you have to do a public service project .
they do .
so they need to share it .
but instead i think it 's going to the wrong places .
the situation down there is weird
you know , they were n't a state
i mean , when you listen to it , it 's um , uh ,
and in the past , maybe the same percentage got them ,
i mean , my thought has been , once the guy has been imprisoned , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed , it should n't make any difference to the , uh , the victim 's family .
it 's like , oh , my
it , it 's , it 's real amateur sports .
and then they went away from it --
or sometimes they do n't like either of the choices --
and for two people to be out in the world like that , i do n't , i do n't want them in my world .
because we just do n't want to send our people there and make them stay .
the only problem is , it keeps you pretty busy , keeping everything going ,
she could just as easily do those things by hand .
i mean there was n't any part of it that you really felt like , no , this ca n't happen .
the hours are good
it 's cheap entertainment .
it 's amazing .
you ca n't always get in when you want too
because look how good we did without a quarterback this year .
i mean , it , it 's easy ,
well , i , i have another thing that i thought about too , for instance , when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is
you know , during , when you 're sitting watching t v at night ,
i think it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk
but even if it 's english , they should just have one .
well , that , that 's a system too .
uh , but it has been , um , it 's been interesting and particularly i , i think because the society in which we live , families are separated .
it 's real nice .
and it 's like , it 's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just , uh ,
that 's neat ,
that 's social change .
and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance .
i , i think , i think the , uh --
and it gets kind of old ,
i think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead ,
it certainly means that we do n't have to experience everything ,
it 's really nice , uh ,
and you 're the minority
but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially .
but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there
that just seemed to me to be a , uh , a phenomenal , uh , demonstration of restraint ,
and that 's pretty of heavy duty .
and they , they at least have , now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline .
you know , before she , before jane fonda did , did what she did , i thought she was a wonderful person ,
if you do n't like it all you do is put on another coat .
they 're consistent .
i would think that for , like people that are just filthy , filthy rich ,
it really is a great place .
you hear about something that somebody else talked about ,
and he 'd have all these people jumping down his back , even though i 'd agree with it .
now i would , now me not even knowing anything about houston , i would think that it 's a pretty calm city .
and i think ,
they say mumblex ruined them .
wonderful touch tone telephone there .
i think you 've , you 've earned that though .
it does make you feel better .
it 's , uh , wordstar was never very intuitive to me .
i , i think that 's , the gap is coming closer a- , as , um , what i 've learned in , uh , just , just being out there .
i think any , any , even if your insurance policy is not the greatest .
well , you are not from that area originally , i can tell .
i think that would be a wonderful way to do it .
i think it 's pretty darned good ,
they are n't that sensitive .
i guess today that would be , uh , some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing ,
and it 's also , it 's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer ,
there 's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that .
and we stole it fair and square ,
but that just may be , you know , perceived ,
but --
and the cardinals were kind of like the cowb- ,
um , ther- , there was n't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and ,
but i feel likes it 's on an individual basis .
it would be like another gone with the wind , i guess --
uh , but that does n't mean that they do n't .
and i guess that 's where yeltsin steps in , so far as his politics of government goes , uh ,
they 've earned it .
oh , he just , like , totally sarcastic and hilarious
they should have been in there longer .
they do n't have that perfect look ,
you ca n't really expect that parent who 's , quite frankly --
i just find it so easy to , to charge something when i do n't have the money to pay for it ,
it 's a lot of waste
but they changed the , uh , deductions on you ,
i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really , kind of gives it a --
that they are going to write a book .
i mean , they 're manipulated by their children .
because it makes a bigger problem . um ,
i guess it 's twenty-five ,
it , it 's good as , in terms of , in terms of , uh , of a contest .
so i , i do n't think they are too ,
i , i guess that is a , tha- , that is a source of reading .
i mean like even , even going to the grocery store .
and it was great .
i mean , she 's , you know , she appeared to me to be very petite
and actually it 's probably safer on , you know , at long trips because it keeps you more active .
but , there , too , there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly , i think in civil cases .
but in , in the long run maybe that 's going to make a better world too .
it is .
people like us , you know .
well , you do n't own cats .
because they 're always ,
that 's the best status .
we 'd learn service to other people --
well that 's it then , i think ,
we , we do n't know , half the time we do n't know who to support .
and really receive some revenues from .
and , uh , i do n't know exactly how we 're going to cover many of these people , because i 'm sure that some of them do n't , uh , do n't have the wherewithal to do it themselves ,
that 's enough to make anybody paranoid .
so , uh , i know the politicians , uh , are n't , are n't straightforward .
but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home --
the other thing , i , i think if you do get overextended a little bit , you need to be sure and pay it off , uh , more than one at a time , because i think you could run forever paying what they require .
kind of like the cowboys , i guess .
uh , and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that , uh , things like drug laws seem to come and go .
i mean , there 's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the , if the wife is going to actually be a mother .
well , brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold ,
-- and , with , uh , i guess with the oil burning over in kuwait and stuff , that would have a lot of air pollution in it .
and , uh , i guess if people got thirty , forty thousand bucks to spend on a car , uh , that 's their prerogative , you know .
even though they did n't bring it in , they help it once it 's there .
we need to get , try to get hold of it and , and have it be , things be honest
but it should be if it 's not .
and that is sometimes what some women who have to work , that is all they can afford .
well , i know that when you 're in a smaller community ,
and now that they are voting and people , you know , getting into mumblex drug and that stuff .
what the stan- flag stands for i guess to me is
it has to be .
and you have to rack your brain ,
and he had a way of putting you in that scene , you know .
one of the things that is a problem is that , uh , in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers .
there are too many big problems , you know .
but here in dallas it 's , i think they all were planted by the classical johnny appleseed , and johnny pecanseed , whatever you would call it , you know ,
well , it 's , uh , you know , it was the time for the passing of the guard , i mean .
the , the first one is we need people in there that , that understand , uh , numbers . the numbers that are being thrown around when , when we 're talking in trillions of dollars .
it 's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party .
i believe we are .
if they chose not to , that 's acceptable .
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not .
and , and there 's probably , there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy .
between mart and marlin , they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour .
and , uh , it 's , it 's just , it 's just a gorgeous country .
he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else .
and i think that if anything , that , when mumblex he was saying the idea that we learned , we l- , we learned a lot from vietnam --
and i think that 's sort of unfortunate ,
but , uh , not everybody can make that choice
compared to what we , our salary is --
but , uh , i sense that it 's not going to happen anytime soon .
and , uh , so that is not as good , uh , you know ,
those are pretty .
it is scary .
they have really simplified things .
-- and that was not enjoyment .
uh , but maybe standardizing on , on a , a four year term for congress --
but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country ,
and the mavericks are t- ,
it really is .
well , i think pride in our country and our flag is so important .
but it really makes you wonder what other lists you 're own that have been made , uh , public that you ,
sometimes it blows up anyway .
and it hurts everybody 's pocket , of course ,
and , it feels good
and --
we have n't had too much ,
something else i think we do can do is support companies that encourage
and then there 's other ones that , uh , deal with , uh , in a funny manner , uh , socially relevant things .
and , you know , you do n't want to , you do n't want to spank it or scare it , or anything like that ,
so , it is something that i think , uh , you know , even the larger organizations will support .
and then they devote , uh , an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind .
with everybody with that mind set . they , they 're --
and a lot of jurors ,
you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be .
and you , and you do n't always even know if it 's , it 's going to be the right place or not .
and there 's always something that , uh ,
so i think that 's real nice too , to come up with different options .
you get some kids in there
and --
and it 's , it 's , it 's , if it 's not affecting someone 's performance then i 'm not sure if it 's a problem .
oh , catfish is wonderful .
it is a problem .
it 's probably more there .
and , uh , the radio 's kind of cruel ,
and , uh , uh , who played the father , anyway --
what is the boy from here ? .
who was in fisher king ?
what are they called ,
or is it tim hardaway .
what 's the word ,
wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something .
what is his name .
what was i going to say about that ,
well , what a wh- , what do we currently have ,
what are some of the things they do n't recycle .
oh ,
okay .
let 's see ,
and let 's see ,
well , let 's see ,
let 's see ,
well , i guess i 'm maybe naive ,
well let 's see ,
no ,
what is , oh , i know ,
well , let 's see , um , ,
well , let 's see ,
i , i tell you ,
but , let 's see , social changes , uh , uh ,
let 's see .
but , uh , let 's see ,
i was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards ,
you started off and said ,
i mean , because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that .
i 'm a kind of , uh , a history nut .
ca n't think of the other one .
and , let 's see ,
let 's see , uh ,
let 's see , what 's next ,
well , let me see .
oh , my goodness .
uh , shoot
well , yeah ,
um , hobbies ,
boy ,
i 'll tell you that .
you know , i look at those ,
um , let me see .
okay .
trying to think what else i like to serve .
uh , in between the thunder showers ,
let 's see .
i 'm , i 'm you know , i 'm in the age group you get out of college ,
there really were three major , um , camps ,
you know , well , to begin with , you know ,
um , let 's see .
uh , how do we take care of the house .
music , um ,
uh ,
so . let 's see ,
just let me see what i got ,
uh , yeah ,
well , i wanted to go .
well , i tell you what ,
let 's see ,
i 'll tell you ,
let 's see ,
but i remember you , you talked about something ,
um , let 's see .
how can i say it ?
and i 'm just here for the rest of the stay .
can you hear me .
i 'll keep this one thank you .
and if you wo n't drop my rates , i 'll just go ahead and send you back your card
but , not only do n't kill them , bless them .
the child will learn to like cats .
am i related to you ?
and then i 'll never leave the place , you know .
mel brooks and meryl streep .
you 're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen .
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems .
and we 'll all go see regarding henry --
it 's not ours , you know .
oh yeah ,
he , he , he needs that salary .
is she having problems ,
this is what old people are supposed to be , thrown over the , the cliff . ''
you know , you work it out for yourself .
you 're such a --
when i was your age i did n't have this or that ,
and i want more , you know .
okay this person is taking drugs ,
i have an old car .
you need to get them ,
we did n't do anything like that --
do n't they , do n't people go for a walk on the beach at night ?
you need to get them into this ,
shove them in , in some school for twelve hours a day .
this is not one that you want to do that with .
how far from home do you want to be .
you render unto god what is god 's .
of course you 're going to study and do well
and they 're harder to get rid of for the weekend , .
if we were going to support this smaller country , then we are going to support it a hundred percent .
if you did not want to do it .
what do you want to do ?
it 's not a good idea .
mama got run over by the train .
you must have the money to do this with ,
you sure you 're a boy ,
have you ever killed your mother ?
and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them .
but you 've got five kids , you know ,
and you 're not doing your job .
but i have n't swung them in quite a few years .
watch me .
and i do n't think like that .
what are these things ?
nobody can have this many relatives ,
mama , i hear it ,
you do it ,
this is wear we 're going to draw the line .
they 'll serve , they 'll serve a quarter of it ,
i need a hole there .
and i do n't want to leave it .
did you feel like you did a good job ?
there 's a lot of us that are opposed to war
ca n't you do that with , you know , what we have ,
just so you 'll know ,
and everything is put together with exacting tolerances
but then i would n't have you ,
this is your little water , uh , heater in there , for the , uh ,
i 'm not going up there ,
you know , we 're , we 're ,
you can either , you know , go a couple of years locally and , you know , then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then , we might be able to handle it . but ,
that 's great ,
but , uh , you 're not helping the people that are over there by what you 're doing .
this is a sweet .
you bring this ,
okay ,
we 're done .
well you can go into the military
okay , you know , uh ,
we do n't want to hear about taxes ,
you 're going to lock me up one day , are n't you .
we 're going to discuss the different issues and stuff
and you can go there ,
he 's so , cute ,
-- i can --
i want what everybody has .
and see a credit card .
and i ca n't get the light off ,
and that would be all .
you do n't want those ,
let 's just go like a regular vote .
i can just see it now .
do n't you ?
if you 'll shorten your stay then we will , uh , waive the deductible .
they 're going to serve about a quarter .
ran out of jeans .
anything goes when mom 's on the phone .
and then you melt it down .
i 'm working two jobs ,
and , you know , how good a name can i make for myself and so forth .
uh , here 's what went on in asia over the past week ,
you do n't even know who to payoff , huh ? .
and what kind of state are we in if , if most people are going to private schools .
would that , would it have been too much of a price to pay for that ?
you know . what 's , uh ,
and the idea , do we go out and feed these people when they 're hungry .
what are you telling that student ?
does it have a big ten football team
but what if , if that was n't the case .
so what do you do ?
what 's more important , picking up the garbage or educating our kids .
but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials , how they get people who are n't swayed by the news either .
why should an individual just because it 's , just because the state ca n't really find out about it , be able to avoid paying sales tax ?
how can you really deal with an environment where you 're going to lose everything .
so why have any restrictions at all ?
is not that amazing .
i , i mean , i mean , what else could they do to make it better .
could you stand there and watch them beat that guy .
-- and , gosh , what 's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system .
who would they ask ?
what if you had a fire or something with babies ?
my question i guess are they really your peers ?
but how , how often do you do that .
but what do you do with them in the meantime ?
you know what i miss though ?
what i do n't know , is where do we draw the line .
well , well , when is the party here ? .
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there .
what 's in it for her .
or ,
see , am i good , or what ?
and how does your salary deal ,
you know , is that something we should do or should n't do ?
you know , i mean , there 's , what 's to evaluate about him , you know ,
you know , what 's the point ?
how they going to pay their bills .
well what are we going to do about it ?
oh , wha , what else can i tell you about painting ?
and was it a dolphin or a torpedo .
is n't that ridiculous .
and , and , and do we , do we support the sandinistas or , or do we support , uh ,
are you going to blow all that money ,
um , but , um , what else has been on and about .
and ,
but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints , i mean wha- , what , what happens if you say no .
oh , have you .
who knows .
what do they get paid .
i mean , what are we , what are we becoming ?
what happens if we lose worse .
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you 're behind the times in technology .
so ken , how do you do your family budget ?
you know how that is ,
so how are we letting them get away with it .
who do you think ?
how 'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour --
you know , how can you , how can you justify raising anybody 's salary if you , you know , if you have to lay people off ?
-- but , i mean , what would somebody do with them .
you ?
right ?
right .
does n't it ?
right .
okay ?
well , you know ?
right ?
lobster ?
oh , do you ?
and you do n't want to part with any of them because there 's --
schedule a .
rather than using taxes .
the smog and ,
well they can get into almost anything anymore .
average .
because you do n't eat any of those things .
oh , teenage mutant ninja turtles .
recently ,
the next generation ,
to worry about it .
oh , oh , if they , if they 're content there ,
because everybody 's competing for jobs .
are overmedicated , too .
to see what 's happening .
and , boy ,
what age they 're accountable ,
of green glass .
they had you pegged .
it 's quite a bit different .
to watch them ,
under the stands .
with the company than ,
dictator ,
and they usually ,
it helps a bunch .
purchases .
of ram .
on paper .
in one hour , like quantum leap .
or , two tone , or two tone .
after you have been on this .
to children .
and offer you , you know , help if you need help .
is it guilt or innocence .
-- and then they do n't provide very much education .
suspicious .
the carton .
a , a legit ,
he 's out of there .
than sit down and take the effort to read --
green .
he 's got to go to a lot of trouble .
a lot of things ,
superstar .
oh , as a ,
they raise them .
not just give up your job and jump right into it .
the cards .
carpools , uh ,
what do you do with it ,
used those for , uh , mulch ,
not always safe .
challenges .
years ,
to be feared --
is not --
you spend what you have
bring some of these things out .
being there all --
and then the russians even ,
it 's already outdated .
you just know from heart .
then , yeah ,
that dialect .
or pay for it after school .
and her surroundings .
in pain or something .
with a conviction ?
giving a different sentence .
became civilized .
so , and how do you feel about it ? .
what about yourself ?
what about season to season .
uh , what was it like living there ,
what else can we talk about ?
why do n't you tell me what you have found .
what do you think about that ?
how about popular music ?
what , what about you ?
but what , what , what are the steps ?
as far as the , as the trends ?
so , how do you feel about the metric system ?
uh , how do you feel about it ?
what do you think ?
how about you ,
how abou- ,
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in america ?
well ,
what about you ?
and ,
how about you ? .
so . let 's see what else can we do ?
wh , what do you think of , uh , of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth ?
but , uh , what do you think about the mess that 's , we 've created in iraq ?
well , what kind of things do you like to do when you go to colorado ?
how about you ?
let 's see , how about , uh , man from uncle ?
what about you ?
what do you like ?
what about you ?
what do you think about the , uh , peace corps or public service commitment ?
anything else you wanted to add ?
-- so , um , what about your wife ,
how do you feel about them ?
so what do you think about that ?
well what are the others ?
what do you think about the benefits in jobs ?
how do you feel about it ?
what about you ?
how do you feel about it ?
how about yourself ?
what about you ?
well did you have boys , girls ,
how , how do you look at counting credit cards ?
what vacations have you been on that you like ?
how about you ?
what , what magazines do you have at home ?
so what do you think ?
what , what do you think about them ?
well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are , that are an invasion of your privacy ?
what do you use yours at home for ?
if you were , uh , what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers ?
what about you ?
so , uh , what things do you consider an invasion of privacy ?
uh , what do you think was different ten years ago from now ?
what did you think of that one ?
what could they possibly be thinking .
are there others that you 're dissatisfied with ?
so , how do you feel about our policy in latin america ? .
so , um , how do you feel about the crime in your city ?
but wh , what kind of things are you looking for ?
how about you ?
what about vacation ?
what do you think ?
um , how about you ?
i do n't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through .
that was , uh , that was a lot of fun .
so , uh , more and more of our hospitals , especially , over here are getting them
-- and peter strauss had played the lead role
but i did n't see quite as much of that sort of thing , as panamanians are just about as , as , uh , as mumblex as americans , as far as , uh , creature comforts , you know ,
there is in that area .
uh , i have n't , i have n't played in a while , but i do , when i get time and it 's pretty weather and it 's summer i like to play golf .
they , they ,
i 'll turn that on while i 'm in the shower and while i 'm getting ready because there 's really not much else i can do --
i watched a little bit of , uh , of the bulls game
a liter 's about a quart .
but they 're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it 's not , you know , a problem ,
my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school --
it was a somewhat of a commercial because it c- , i saw it regularly
i mean , you do n't have anything transferring , just a little signature ,
you do n't notice it .
it 's not too difficult .
my wife and i can share a bedroom .
i aim ,
and that 's how they continue the thing .
and we 're going to do that until at least the first part of may .
and i just had to replace one of them ,
but i taught junior high .
they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five .
but i never realized you could n't record onto c- ,
my favorite show is masterpiece theatre
well , i know on sundays we all elect now to chip in
uh , i know that there are young people , characterized , i guess as being half my age , so that by definition that means ,
i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever
i think all mine have been east coast people so far .
i had a friend from there .
and , uh ,
so i 'm going to be down on the floor with them .
and it worked .
and the whole bit and ,
but actually i 'm getting a call .
i just find them boring .
whistler and black home is in canada ,
so you ca n't use it anyway .
so , so we were giving them a little too much ,
well , at least i 've heard that
and --
so the first year humanities courses everyone had to read the iliad an , and so forth ,
and then it takes three weeks and all .
so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power
and you know ,
and that , i know that , uh , brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because , i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it
i read somewhere ,
-- and , and i could concentrate on the creativity , and , and you know , really having a lot of fun with the children and --
it will be a year in august .
well , we lived , we lived in south dakota ,
but , uh , but our organization is doing something else t- , on monday .
i have , i have one ,
i 'm a real big fan of hers
well , he does a lot of like , um , uh , movie adaptations and things like that .
and , uh , she was not persecuted or anything else like that .
this is a b fifty-two base where i work ,
well , people that are , um , have received sentences in jail , they have , uh , some of them are going out and doing , uh , they have to go out and do public service --
we do not watch a lot of t v ,
i had been through saint joe ,
most people talk to texas ,
and i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time ,
but that 's pretty much everything i 've worked with
but i did n't want to go to texas .
and said , we 're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do n't pay .
we do n't have our kids play with other kids on sunday --
and there are only two of them
you know the governments taken care of that ,
so i have n't really gone ,
and , course , everything 's down ten to twenty percent now .
singapore is very , supposed to be very safe
but then you get into all these issues of , of whether it , it 's the types of pollution and what it 's doing to your lungs
i keep , you know , um , you know , there 's like three movies that i , i keep telling myself that i should see one of these , you know , some day that i have n't seen , you know , that , that are classics , you know .
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
it was familiar your accent .
but , uh , our water supply right now is bad .
well , uh , interestingly enough , right before i moved up here ,
sprinkler systems or anything , uh , start to get real expensive because there 's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock .
because you 're combine- , uh , confined by space ,
that 's about all the time i can , i can spare .
i 'm not scared of it .
we go , we go through enid , you know , quite a bit .
boston 's above .
and because i had been in a small school , they suggested that i probably , i ,
tarpley ,
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period .
the ones in like the baltic states --
and even for a personal computer it 's probably smart to spend that much ,
i mean --
we hear a lot about , uh , new york city .
i think that is important too .
only the fort worth opera .
i think it 's ,
they 're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day .
and uh , we have , well , we 've got four regular parties every year
cause i , i spent thirteen years there .
now that i 'm alone why , uh , i , uh , prefer to travel overseas if i 'm going anywhere .
plus , you teach middle school ,
i think they may be playing up --
i 'm , i 'm against it .
well , my wife 's toyota is soon to be four years old ,
typical texas spring .
but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation , three , i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and ,
and she came through a , a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig , um , sty ,
so do i .
we are really looking forward to it .
so it 's been fairly recent .
and --
and it , it really helped a lot ,
they 're getting kind of old
but we like our area .
and the amount of work that we 're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers , because , uh , it 's so much involved --
but what , what i plan to do in the future is , um , go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters ,
but like this tile 's come loose off the wall ,
and , and i was like , oh .
they have one character on there
or whether they 'd just bring them
and any money you earn will go to the victim 's family .
uh , i do n't know we 'll have to , to ,
uh , well , we only have one child right now and another one on the way
see i 'm , i 'm doing my , uh , master 's in computer science and computer engineering .
but i enjoy receiving them .
she 's a love ,
they , they all play different songs .
well as , as someone who would , would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander , i feel more comfortable with people having blades because , uh , you 're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly
we bought more things
and it said that what , what do we , do we think that cri- , certain crimes should fit certain punishments ,
see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night .
but three and a half weeks ago , we had an ice storm .
i 've never done a canoe trip .
we go wh- , more for the , uh , chinese --
and they spell it out .
so i was thinking well , maybe , you know , i need to think about getting rid of them ,
you know , i mean , we , we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania ,
she 'd ,
like , i mean they have , um , better ,
i went , what .
uh , well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty , sixty dollars for a really , really nice course .
but , i play in a couple of leagues and , and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend .
i did n't hear that .
went to a , uh , to a mud hens double header .
i was teaching for richardson school district .
we stripped ours , we stripped ours off .
just recently i was kind of laughing when i , when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because , uh , i had to have my , uh , radiator flushed --
and i read in this article , i could n't believe it , where , you know , like , one cow produces , like , a day , produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure .
and it , it really made a completely different man out of him .
it does
usually in the summer time .
uh , but we both work
but , uh , and my wife does n't work .
but that 's about the extent of our lawn care .
that 's the only thing they broadcast
i , uh , i guess i , it , it frightens me to think of so many people with , with aids and with cancer
and we have about ten acres ,
uh , and i had been told , you know , you would n't notice that it was three hours long , and all this ,
and he knew what he needed to do .
you know , he 's this actor , right --
i went to europe for six weeks after i graduated from college
but i maybe would buy a b m w .
because w , when i went to work for them , uh , they did n't do that ,
and i had to carry a beeper around
well , i , um , i do an awful lot of preparation of documents , um , uh ,
taco bueno ,
it was only like four miles to work
it 's so relaxing to just sit ,
the whole time we were there it was very , very political .
i read a lot of science fiction .
right now we do n't have cable .
and , um , i like to read books on improve , like family , marriage , you know , things that are written by like christian authors or , um , doctors about family and , you know , how to improve your home and all that kind of thing .
i am in the thirty something ,
i like cosby ,
uh , thank god that i had one .
this is a real first .
but my sister-in-law , she 's always done a lot of camping .
but , uh , when we had the divorce , she just did n't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house .
back a long time ago , when the rap music first came out --
it 's the last set of condominiums there ,
but one , one thing that i really dislike , uh , also that 's , that 's new is the , uh , is that i have heard that there are federal sentences ,
magazine companies , uh , uh , from , from subscriptions do the same thing --
and i went , oh , i can do that
and then i like to barbecue , like steaks or pork chops .
that 's just something i had n't heard of
we 're just above carmel ,
although i saw a survey recently
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they ca n't do it .
sometimes i feel like all i 'm doing is changing diapers , giving bottles , and putting babies down for a nap .
so , when you see something that 's on recycled paper , they 've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that .
and i look through , uh ,
cause that 's about thirty years ago .
that 's one way to do it , because that , that forces you to pay for it --
but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here --
and , uh , all that , because there was ,
i mean , that 's really nice .
but that 's , that 's where answering machines are nice , because if it 's really important they 'll leave a message
i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car
i 've , i 've read a lot of things , um , since i got involved in the water business back in eighty-three ,
i like sean connery ,
-- and that makes it really handy , too --
and i 've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian ,
and it was in the floor
there 's a german word for it that 's elegant ,
that 's about what it takes me to get to memorial .
i do n't know that i could even think about quilting .
you know , i can hit a great drives and think i 'm going to do all awesome on this hole
my dad 's always cosigned on , on my , my loans , or whatever ,
could go either way , you know ,
um , um , i do n't know if you follow broadway , much ,
but , i , i do n't get to see that as much as i want
uh , tools for set up and for measurement .
so , that way we , we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area
the woodworking .
and they said in general , generals are more familiar with training , that they believe in training more .
um , from the people i 've talked to , i do n't know if i should bring this into it ,
what kind of mothers they are ,
-- and , uh , i 'm trying to think of the ones that i 've been on that i liked the most
my love was n't there for the game .
uh , the backyard is just huge .
but --
and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark ,
and they list them .
our --
-- there is ,
and i pretty much took it loose on the inside .
he 's a ex-lawyer
well being in , in baltimore see ,
and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the aut- , for the audi dealer
so i 'm kind of looking forward to that , except i hate to see them go .
and we have n't had that lego train together for years ,
three times a year she 's really busy doing certain things --
another one coming in september ,
but more you see these commercials that have jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in new york while jimmy 's in rome .
and , uh , when i came down to dallas , it was , uh , you know , i found myself rooting for the home team .
i mean , i went in the service when i was eighteen ,
she 's taken a lot of french ,
we just did n't take enough blankets and --
oh , i did n't realize that .
yet , if you 're caught with ,
so the doors movie , that 's out on video . i want to watch that .
they did n't .
but it 's , although it 's not the same , we are ,
jus- , i just have a channel that has music except for , like every hour , you know , say eight o'clock , nine --
and then i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups
so i 'm , i 'm same generation .
well , some of them , yes they do
and a , uh , we 'll use a wood burning stove as well .
and , uh , his business is going down the tubes so bad , you know .
-- and , uh , we get black-eyed peas off of it and stuff
i do n't even really know who she is , you know .
and , uh , they were doing a presentation
and if you go out to dinner , there 's virtually , you know , there 's not a whole lot of things you can get .
and i find i do n't do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own .
i know that ,
and they they just did n't like participate together with the others --
if we see a child that we have any reason , that 's on drugs , such as if he 's got a beeper or if they 're , if they 're flashing lots of money around . we 've , there are certain things to do .
and he gets , uh , you know , the full health and dental
but i 'm from the dallas area .
it was the charge card and social security number .
and close to that , what 's called duck creek that runs through part of garland , that 's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there 's , there 's the hard rain .
i 'll tell you what we could do .
and then i forget to bring them in the store .
it 's , it 's just , um , you know , a light weight --
uh , i grew up in new york
we go to the lake just about every weekend down at mount vernon
i 've never been up to the yellowstone area .
and they would , they would switch back to one of their israel bureaus ,
my , both of my parents are dead ,
and at that time , uh , it was is a changing time for the whole music scene , i guess
and also , uh , i meant to be trying to pick up on murphy brown ,
well , i watch , um ,
but i got out of it again because --
so it 's just kind of nice , and especially when i have my cat that comes down and joins me .
the brick is multi color .
or just hand beat it .
-- uh , i do n't always succeed at that .
i was in four h
and i thought , ooh ,
is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country ,
oh , he 's been a legend for so many years , you know ,
i 'm kind of embarrassed i 'm talking to a man , cause i 'm sure that you are , you play a lot more than i do .
but it 's , it 's pretty , it 's fun to play .
i ca n't , i ca n't conceive of doing that .
and i got a lot of bills .
i rarely go
we 've both seen one .
-- and he can get free medical care , but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing david --
and we were living in new jersey .
they have one area in town where the people ,
bobby witt --
you can do with ,
all i had was sweats ,
and i took , i signed up for one that was three nights a week , an hour and a half ,
but it was n't something that i would enjoy seeing twice or three times .
they do n't understand that because they have fifty dollars ,
she might .
and they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in ,
uh , but i was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago , right after that game ,
and , uh , well , give you an idea ,
i know when we had ,
i only skied once my whole life .
and they make sure that if they want to go to church , there 's a bus there .
he likes to dig around a little bit .
it was one of those , uh , those , dome type pop up tents .
it was kind of , you know , it was kind of different , i guess .
i like --
probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there 's a magazine called computer shopper .
plano school system .
but he 's been protesting ,
all i know , alls i can really remember is him flying this great big dog , this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing ,
and , you know , but my husband is from new jersey
of course , we see smaller animals all the time ,
-- and , uh , that 's what we went through .
and she 's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes .
i ca n't remember what it is they do n't take .
and now i feel lost .
and , you know , like i told him , you 're a little bit young for a gun . let me go out here and , you know , we would start with the b b gun deal , you know ,
i have a lot of
that 's where i live , close to that .
theirs might not run a thousand dollars .
uh , i 'm not as good as i 'd like to be
and --
they 're already doing it in the armed forces , where they handle weapons and so forth , uh ,
he was so excited about going .
and my kids , i think , are very , very secure , well raised children .
they used to just have like , uh ,
i mean , i guess i could be thankful for that .
it 's just , it 's just such a change from , uh , texas because i had grown up with , uh , the heat ,
and i do n't know if we 'll ever see that you know . where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and , uh , has , uh , you know ,
but in effect , i 'm paying twice for one service .
-- i mean it 's , uh , it 's a lot more exciting than actually w , than watching it on t v .
and we really have n't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current , uh , especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here .
and then , uh , then there 's the ones that you never know anything about ,
and you ask the right questions and can research ,
you know , like , how , uh , these two , there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other --
they , they were interested in a lot of things ,
we like it ,
and maybe ,
and ,
and so , we 're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it . and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit .
it 's good stuff , you kno ,
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at clark , they 're all pretty fancy .
i , uh , weight train , uh , three days on and one day off .
but you see the water leaving your arm ,
-- we never get them at both of them --
we had a , he had his own heat lamp and , uh , and , uh , hot pad he laid on , you know .
so , um , that was the instrument both of my children started on ,
so i thought that was kind of an in , interesting coincidence .
um , congress has added too towards the members bank there , you know ,
uh , a strange case that , uh , that happened , oh , it 's about , about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine .
and we do n't have any kids yet ,
if you compare the , like the people that could have , that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that , you know , the people that , uh , did send their kids to private --
well , there is a woman in our choir , who is nearly famous for her apple pies ,
i have ,
i , see that 's the problem .
and uh , it 's really , it 's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff ,
it snowed a little bit , um , probably about four days ago --
and , um , there 's a sister older than me ,
there 's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes .
but i do n't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff ,
his name is , uh , oh ,
two thousand out of eleven thousand , that 's about a little over twenty per cent . uh ,
as a matter of fact , i was thinking that same thing , unconditional love .
i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese --
and you paddle your way back in and hope it does n't start raining on you right away .
it 's hard to explain .
the thing is , when a woman does work , then there is the clothes to buy ,
but when i come down here , everybody told me they are flags .
but they did n't provide it .
he had some cocaine and th- , it was accused of selling it ,
but this is the season for that .
so it 's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed .
oh , we 're sort of in the middle of , uh , the extension of the cajun country too , so we have , um , a lot of ambiance provided by , you know , the , the bands and everyth- , you know , like you said jazz bands and things like that .
but actual , you know , that 's sometimes different , done on a different scale .
this , it 's a big engineering school
and the older generation is not needed
i do too .
um , and i always , that always bothered me
they looked really cute .
sometimes it 's too good because he throws too hard .
but that was back ,
but i think it 's good for , you know , for , for company , too ,
i 'm kind of a doubting thomas
i know .
i , i , i guess i been thinking about it
i sometimes watch t v if i ,
but then there 's another thing that i disagree with in texas is sometimes you have a jury of six
well , i , i just know which one she is .
uh , also , i 've alw- , i 've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the ,
but it is fun to , you know , seeing the show anyway .
and they 're more expensive of course
uh , i 'm a native texan .
i either watch the news
but , you know , they 're going up ,
as far as using them outside that i 'm not , i do n't use them too much
uh , i would consider going to a , a non , to a normal pickup rather than a , a covered pickup like the one i 've got . just because there 's a lot of times i wished i had , ju- , just an open bed to throw stuff in .
so , it keeps them busy .
they were g- , they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit .
you get , uh , more or less , uh , you get basic electronics courses that , uh , deal with , you know , not only the digital circuitry but , uh , you know , power supplies and , and , uh , just the whole gambit , but mostly towards , uh , computer electronics .
i ca n't really say much about the schools up here .
those were the last two that i 've seen .
there 's no particulates in natural gas , of course .
but i have four children ,
and they said the record showed i served ,
me being one person with a above the median income ,
and i think somebody told me it 's also on a creek side lot , heavily wooded off the golf course .
um , we do n't hang around with them , because usually it 's , you know , ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that .
she said , i know she does n't get to touch it .
and like i said , once , once it , it happened i could n't because my son 's tuition came due ,
live on an island off , off shore from seattle .
we take them back , you know , and use the ones that we have .
-- and all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds
but he was talking , would n't it be nice to carpool ,
i , i guess i would like to probably editorialize more .
but we put him in a private school in richardson ,
and i , in the past , have done a great deal of , of , uh , system development just through , uh , software development programming .
i 'm still --
it 's b , a , r , g , e , double l , o
and it was kind of pooh-poohed , you know .
but , uh , i , i think he kind of follows the sports
and my last name is even more common --
i do n't know what you 'd call it other than on line .
-- so there 're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any , any week ,
and they were gone .
it was when , uh , his mother , his step father had died the year before ,
it was just pure automobiles .
and now the economy is bad ,
as far as new stuff to recycle , you know , i do n't really , i do n't really know ,
he did apply to a large , you know , large group ,
i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well .
and they said ,
my little boy is crazy about captain kirk .
and , uh , that guy mumblex , the short stop , is going to be good .
and they have weekly meetings and everything
because , i do n't mind doing that ,
i mean , i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago
my parents keep the house cold .
they 've got a screwed up situation , i 'll give them that . from mexico all the way down into cen- , central and south america .
right now our house does n't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there ,
but , uh , i was , i was working to get through college and , and , uh , trying to make it through that ,
and , i seen a few of them actually race
i ca n't remember ,
i videotape it when i have to miss it .
and i , i , i tend to agree with that .
and i 'm working nights just kind of covering , uh , shutdown equipment and everything ,
like i 'll be really tired ,
and then i got into it and then back out of it ,
that 's wonderful .
and they 're , they have n't had , what , that much luck in south america
and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you 're ready .
i think that adds to the diversity ,
i mean our red light district , i mean , uh , you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life , you know ,
it says , let men run the world , women have more important things to do .
that 's what we have . um .
we talked about this for a few minutes ,
a lot of wisdom in it .
they used them in afghanistan , did re- , remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in .
uh , because i have a , an economy car right now , which is okay ,
i ca n't believe that --
uh , right now i 'm in utah ,
we have a couple of young children ,
that 's what they said it was kind of ,
all my aunts and uncles .
i , i really do n't see anything wrong with it ,
they do n't , they do n't even start growing until may ,
and they did n't take a refrigerator .
i mean , this is such a tremendous ,
now at work , uh , you know , we have changed our recycling .
i know you do yours at work ,
so they 're not too much into beef .
so , so that 's , i think , one of the reasons i do n't need to budget is that i do n't have , i do n't , i do n't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i ca n't afford it , because i 'm not interested in that expensive thing .
in fact , i 'm still going .
we 're like ,
and while he was being severely , uh , censored and could not make any judgment call on this , it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda ,
i , i , i agree with that .
and i just enjoy that much more too than inside .
uh ,
and , uh , finally , uh , she had parkinson 's disease ,
well , you 're catching me at , it , uh , uh , at mind 's end here .
i was twenty-seven when i got married
i wish i could remember his name .
it was a little strange , you know ,
and , um , gosh we tried , what was across the street , el paso 's --
we went
well , we both decided we wanted to move to north carolina .
-- it will be whole .
she can
actually i , i grew up water skiing .
and i never have ,
but it all dried out , you know . did n't --
but , one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill , per month , last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars --
well , i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged
but they , you know , the craze really picked up big here
i do n't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is
but i did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves --
my husband is really good ,
uh , we , we tended to want to keep on giving lavish ,
you know , go across the border and all .
i know when our kids were growing up , our , we were big into water sports .
if i , you know , if i happen to find it , i 'll go ahead and read it someplace , you know , if i 'm in a doctor 's office or something like that
and , i know the reason why this is , why the , uh , this is being gathered and the program and so forth ,
there was , there was four of us kids ,
i got to wait for a place to , to , to free up .
because , um , even if our kids , you know , get into sports that we 're really not interested in , i do n't , i want them , you know , to know that we 're still there --
and yet , you know , and we were just sort of talking about it at the time .
i guess they have those , uh , driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other .
and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it , that just a basic , general user can understand them .
we eat at shoney 's .
and most of them ,
well , i know i , uh , about three years ago i , i tended some children .
the roof was really sorry .
i play at least three times a week .
my husband goes to pick it up last week
it basically means that it has a swiss cheese , cream sauce with it
-- and , uh , i really enjoy , especially the sixties ...
that 's just one of the many rumors that floats around .
and as soon as the oil prices came back down , we , the pendulum swang the other way .
it 's --
i would n't send my dog to buy a car from middlekauff ford .
and , uh , yeah everybody , everybody was pretty much , you know , let 's burn him .
it , it lasts a long time .
i 'm pretty sure i did .
they 've got a ne , new c d out ,
oh , that was one of my favorites ,
and just the photos i have of it and gosh , incredible and be so close ,
you know , i , i really do n't like that stuff
uh , and this , uh , next sunday they 're coming over after the cowboy game
and if they saw us watching the , something ,
and see what they think of them ,
and the other half the time i just ignore it
because , i know that there , now there , they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles .
so he heats us up a good fight
but , the other thing that i thought of on this is , i wonder if there is n't enough money , uh , in our economy or in our system .
and the guy said , oh , get this , it 's a nice shiny gloss , which was true ,
and we play three days in a row , three different courses
it was on the news every night .
but actually catching fish to eat per se , you do n't really do much of that right there .
and then , you know , we 've got some guys here that they are , you know , four and five handicappers --
but when you 're only earning half the salary . even though i was n't spending much money , i sometimes i sometimes would just ,
um , i put it on the frame , the quilting frame .
but they look like different color ones ,
i got , i , i 've got one vice
although , uh , i will personally tell you , i used to work at a bank ,
-- and to some level even russia was behind .
and it does add up .
and --
and so my do n't change dramatically over the years .
i was ,
um . well , you know , sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards .
-- i have a lot of trees , down here , uh ,
kind of like a radar gun .
because i personally do n't like the combination rooms .
now , some of the ones that have just received the awards this year , i have n't read ,
um , now i 'm , actually i 'm , i 'm not working anymore .
but i do have a personal computer on my desk here .
now our temperatures down here , we 're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties --
chili .
we just going to spend it all .
i have n't ever done fancy painting
so you 'll still see people ,
uh , overall on campus about twelve hundred , but in the upper school , upper four grades , uh , about four hundred and something
and when we got him a new one it was brown
uh , five .
well , we have a , a bigger house than a lot , you know ,
i mean , it 's not something i 'd want to do real often .
it was a book before it came out in a movie ,
um , we 've been married for twenty-three years --
well , my , my , uh , stepfather and them have , my stepfather , my father-in-law , and them have that .
i mean , nothing .
um , i 'm at b y u .
have n't tried that either .
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and , you know , what day ,
and i 'm not sure when a good time to plant those is , if they should be planted early or later .
and you know it 's like you go on a trip
it is ,
you know , according to the owners ,
but even then , i did n't end up doing it on my own . uh , uh ,
and they are still , still do not have it
she 's a year and a half old now ,
of course , we did n't really rough it that much .
another thing that we do is we always fly back to california and washington each christmas .
uh , i do walking on the treadmill ,
and people have told me .
but here a lot of the country stuff is in , you know , a lot of the woodwork , a lot of , uh , stenciling .
i 've got a chicken casserole that 's like that , that , that i 've ,
oh , well , actually i 'm from california
and that 's --
-- and , you know , she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children .
um , i like it because , um ,
they 're , they 're like late forties , early fifties ,
that 's helped me a lot with having ,
and that that , uh , peer pressure ,
my daughter got jealous
and we were driving back
so i guess about two more years .
-- and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic .
i seen an old woman today ,
there 's a little bit of brown sugar in there ,
and like , that blooms a lot .
i really liked it .
my son is , uh , twenty-eight ,
but , uh , i do n't remember her breaking a lot of stuff .
when the war was on i watched c n n and , uh , nightline --
we do have the health care and the , uh , and the medi- , or the dental .
it may be improved by now
but i was single until i was thirty
um , and i remember my older sister .
but then it depends on who you are calling on .
and i would n't trade , change a minute of it for anything .
and i was thinking , i have n't worn this in three years .
so they just want black and white , which mumblex see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick .
they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks --
well , i ,
i just do not ca ,
and , and the younger generation , the next like my cousin 's children , i do n't know very well , you know .
well , i 'm in texas .
i think she was a psych major
it was burnt out about two years ago
and they are just a lot more mature ,
and it 's mumblex sitting in my closet half done right now ,
but , that was our experience
mine are grown ,
and there is a town in georgia ,
i know i want a big family area ,
you know , it does n't have , like all the brass and everything .
and what they ended up doing is , uh , kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening ,
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be , they 're kind of monitored .
sergeant , uh , ma- , major dad .
they are n't , they are n't by nature really nasty critters .
well , here , here 's another one that i 've seen .
and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens , you know
and i 'm know real sure there are , um ,
and those nails are so expensive
somebody , somebody abandoned her
like on , in , on radio , if you hear any news at all , it 's like two seconds .
my bones are getting so old ,
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the , uh , uh , day care centers .
we stayed till about one thirty
i 'm not , i 'm not a great fan of , of government control in general
they 're putting in fifty , sixty hours a week ,
that was fun .
but i mean , it , in the back of my mind , it always bothers me .
it 's just like a day kind of thing , because most of them are , you know , um ,
he might do a good job .
for , for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative , uh , public service for , uh , young people to go into , uh , after high school .
uh , you know , and i do n't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you , you know --
so i subscribe to the san jose mercury news .
now i 've learned to do that --
we try to take her out right before we go to sleep ,
or something would go wrong
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately , you know ,
usually there has to be some wealth involved , which is great , if , if you 're financially , if , if you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money
and then now , i 'm in corporate communications ,
the grass has been growing
so , uh , if i 've missed something and , and i 've just recently decided to stay home with my children
what we do , usually , is , uh , vote , uh , absenteeism --
when we built it ten years ago , it was , it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars .
it 's , it 's less degree days ,
well , she was almost ridiculous .
but , but , i 'm like you ,
but it 's a place in arlington ,
and i 've only substituted , i guess , for the last fifteen years ,
and it was n't air conditioned ,
and , actually , i 've started working up there in the afternoons , too .
and , uh , we were originally planning on going to cayman ,
and boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just do n't say that , you know ,
and , uh , to me i just would n't feel comfortable in that at work ,
i just like them .
you know , kind of off the wall .
i did n't realize that .
-- and , uh , i 've just continued to , uh , stay there mumblex .
i , i ,
but i 've seen it on t v where the juries go one way
my daughter ,
you know , up there , you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry ,
and i can not blame them .
and i used to go watch the toledo mudhens .
i really like them .
it was , it was really fas- ,
it was dig your own hole
and i thought , what a strange combination ,
i hope it 's recording .
we have a three year old and a two year old
um , but i 've never had to leave them like in a day care center ,
she , she does n't like going to movie theaters because usually they 're dirty ,
and now our care plans look more like thirty-two , thirty-three --
and another day i 'll come in
that 's one of my old favorites .
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain .
he had arthritis in his hips
uh , oh , i like him ,
and i just was not ready for kids .
i 'm , i 'm ,
well , we went over to her house ,
-- so , the , the person we found it through the ,
but , um , i work in sort of a building that 's , that 's not really , well
in this area too since , you know , in texas we 're so spread out ,
it was a different movie from anything i 've ever seen .
and we did n't know the difference .
so it 's , it 's not too bad ,
i , i believe in the trial by jury .
it 's on about --
well , i 'm too tired ,
i was n't necessarily a career person --
was about forty-five miles away --
i want to retire quick .
so basically i 'm just ,
we got into it because of seato agreement , back just right after world war two that , uh , we pledged a mutual , uh , uh , defense of , of the south vietnamese ,
but it was rainy and icky .
well , i used to .
and that i know is run by the state ,
uh , i used to do that a lot
it 's been quite a few years .
but we , we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end ,
you know , you 'll hear one report
you have to watch it if you go out to eat
i love disney movies .
it did n't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school --
but the whole group goes out hunting
so that , that makes it pretty nice .
take a twenty-two
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals .
and then there 's a ton .
i like both ,
and at time , you know , they all knew one another .
the other thing about magazines , the only thing i do n't like , is they really get heavily into advertising --
i know it is .
i do n't even know if i , you know , i would not even recommend this person again to anybody .
then again i 'm surprised now i did n't think they 'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show .
all it was , was , you know ,
i , i could n't probably be bothered doing that --
but , that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood --
and w- , we play board games ,
i ca n't even think of what it is offhand ,
at least it was on sale .
i mean , if , if they 're not interested fine .
we like to put our , just put our newspapers in a paper bag , you know , and then carry them up there that way .
however , uh , one that i 've been watching for a number of years is dallas .
and she watches a lot of the cable news network .
i did n't like it at all .
there 's just ,
if i , if see a , s- , if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something --
so , and he did , he served better than we did , you know ,
a brand new mall --
the , the eighties are called , like the progressive years , or the , or , you know , like the technology years ,
like chicken fried steak ,
so if somebody killed somebody in your family , then you had the right to , uh , if that person was caught and found guilty , you had the right to , uh , execute that person .
those are probably my two favorites .
so i mean , it 's your choice where you want to go ,
and , and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff ,
i was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company
he said this way there is n't any .
uh , you know , i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities , particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is , uh , is right on campus as well --
they do n't say , they do n't put mumblex on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy , i 'm sure , for them to do that ,
like depressed mode ,
and we just had a ball .
either watch that or watch nothing .
i , i do n't know if it 's that serious , i- ,
and you ,
you hear people talk about the little dipper .
like they had planned
and there 's some pretty decent campgrounds although , i do n't think raleigh , i do n't think the state of north carolina takes ,
she 's , she 's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff ,
i , i know that , um , i grew up in chicago in the sixties ,
it does n't biodegrade , and , and , uh , the plastics obviously ,
-- so , uh , but i , i just like the giants .
well , the only thing up here ,
you get a --
there was one car in all of the , the metropolitan area that i could find that , you know , was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it .
i have never tried that .
but i do n't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went ,
you say you 're from atlanta .
i 'm , i 'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my , my wife teaches school here in plano .
uh , and i 'm , a , uh , i 'm a big baseball fan ,
but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot , uh , sounding music .
actually i think it has ,
and this only goes up to f .
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of , of afghan .
-- and the barber got a call while i was there , uh , from his son 's school .
and my , my kids ,
he 's like a semigovernment type agent . who goes out then to , uh , works for the phoenix foundation , supposedly .
well , i wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice ,
i mean , it 's like continental french restaurant or something really --
it has completely died out two times .
and i 'm out at brookhaven college ,
so , i , i , i , i , i , i ,
this is , this is a tough one , i do n't , really have n't thought about any of this .
but it is the i b m --
that 's the way we are .
and that 's one of them .
it 's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one , whatever it is ,
so . so television is my main new source .
gosh , i 'm not sure what they 're called now
so , he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together .
they , those have been real popular with my family .
-- so i like reading those to her
well , i have lived in a small town for , you know ,
and we went to see kindergarten cop .
but i 'm just not that involved in it .
i , i- , i have to say that ,
i should n't make stereo types ,
closed up and moved down to mckinney .
and i do n't mean to be knocking , uh ,
the land is paid for cash ,
well , actually i 've done both kinds --
and they will be a little harder ,
i do a lot of channel thirteen , channel three , some of the educational channels ,
and ,
for her young people , her books .
and i 'm not real familiar with , uh , anything that ,
my grandparents and all my relatives are from wisconsin .
i like a v-eight .
like um , my oldest loved sesame street ,
of course , you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents ,
so , now the accused can , can ask for delays and extensions
here is somebody that was in china , le- , two years ago when all that was going on in , in , uh , beijing .
and it 's got all the old , original hardwood trim and stuff ,
and now that they 're each ,
oh baths .
so , , but the dogs are mainly mine and my husb- ,
and she does n't really need the care or anything like that
and , um , and i , i do n't have one ,
and , uh , she got to the point she did n't want to alone anymore .
-- but i 'm originally from san antonio --
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint --
and so we had , they had , uh , like a berry assortment .
by the time we went around it was , uh , four couples
and --
so i can record some things from her and , you know , get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to
and it be ready in just a few minutes .
but we have a modem .
uh , it is twelve or ten down here .
-- and , uh , they ,
and , uh , i do n't think i 've ever even been in one .
people that i know that --
they 're , they 're , they 're in the same issue .
i 've got two little ones
and , of course , at this university , uh ,
i , uh , i was thinking about buying a prelude from a friend who was moving to new york or something
and , uh , i do water aerobics .
so , i at first thought , you know , when i did n't have kids ,
both times they were at our house .
i 'm renting at the time ,
but , well that 's all i can really think about for recycling .
at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle .
and it kept going on
but he would not vote --
-- uh , you know , there are a large number of them on the road .
i just , i love it .
other than that , i do n't have too much on credit cards
as far as the camping part of that , we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and , uh , find , uh , find a clearing in the woods and go for it .
you know , got kids that , mumblex either got a , you know , a magnum gun school ,
and i have n't figured out how to get that off .
i mean , we 've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy , eighty thousand --
even if it 's at the top and it 's a lot of black smoke coming out , it still settles ,
it 's something to do .
and my husband , it turns out ,
so , and , and plus he 's getting on in his years now .
it 's like , just put in ,
one of these calls --
it would have to be cut into four-foot lengths .
well , i learned something already .
she 's the little girl
aids has more money than , uh , breast cancer .
i , i do n't have time .
well , i really like vivaldi .
that 's kind of how war of the roses was .
i 'm in dallas .
and , uh , it 's about sixteen hundred square feet ,
but i feel like , i do n't know , when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them .
-- it 's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins .
and --
uh , it 's funny watching them , them play ,
and i usually , when i hear about a movie that 's supposed to be very good --
one guy practically roasted a goat in his , in his dorm
one of the two , uh ,
and , uh , i was home a few years ago
uh , we live in a rural area up here .
-- but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it .
and i lived over in england for four years ,
there are days when , uh , i come home and she says here take these kids ,
and that 's about it ,
because , um , his , his , his trial was , you know , was , it wa- , it was televised and this and that ,
uh , i did at one time .
you know , what kind of shoes did he wear on the night ?
and so , that , uh , that bothers me because i , of course , i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers --
he , he did ,
and you really do n't want the garbage in your house ,
and i said , i want a backpack .
uh , well , i 'm not sure how it is in georgia ,
my last , right , my last chance to win ten million dollars ,
. um , right now , um , i try when it 's nice out ,
and , and they shed some light on what was going on for me .
y- , it 's been a few years
but --
i 'm just brushing up on , well , c plus plus .
we had a house and a home and ,
and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change , i wish that
probably , maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only --
um , as far as spare time , they talked about ,
i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor , or , or , or the politicians in the , in there ,
and it 's , it 's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in ,
i 'm , i 'm dealing with the loans right now ,
and it really tastes pretty good .
and sometimes after i 've worked all day --
if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind --
and , uh , died six weeks after they put him in the home .
uh , by deliberate i , uh , i mean mistake , mistakes of omission or , uh , or , uh , biased toward a particular view point --
but , but it 's this maintaining a , a regular habit that i just ca n't --
-- but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was .
i 'm in the auto parts business myself .
-- greatful dead , crosby , stills and nash .
but we did , uh , like two heavy coats over it .
lilly , lilly , she said , she said it 's for your daughter to use .
but , now for instance , we , we had a scout dinner last night we went to .
and , of course , there you know you have a specific place to put your paper .
there 's , there 's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue .
if they 're perp , perpetrating the aids problem , passing that on to each other , then --
i , i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years .
so my , my , i think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year .
but , still we will share that job .
and , uh , uh , , but , uh , and now sailing , i 've never been sailing .
they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class .
i just signed up
well i enjoy singing .
if i work too many days , then i lose all my state aid
well , i 'm , i guess i do n't have su- , such close experience with , with , um , an area becoming a state as you do .
i , i , in fact i was in texas for a little while .
now , i have the town car
it 's kind of like , uh , spring , i guess , if you , year round , except ,
i , i just get really upset every time i make that check out .
and i , um , i just refuse to buy it , um , if i know i 'm not going to be there for at least --
when i was a kid , uh , we 'd do the equivalent thing in the high sierras .
i 'm , uh , that , that 's a whole , pleased with the pr- , practice that is they ,
i 'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood , that 's their first homes --
oh , i like it .
the , the best of every type of music .
but that was our general tendency anyway .
i find that , uh , about two years is probably my max --
there 's always a dif- ,
and you set it out
i am too .
actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me .
me either .
but , uh , but basically , uh , there 's lots of things that , that we should know about projects .
that 's what i was thinking they , they sometimes do .
in fact my brother has a , uh , a exotic pet shop out in california ,
in richardson does .
i mean , i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that .
i think some shows , some ,
it really bothers me .
uh , my daughter and her husband work saturdays .
i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it
but it is atlanta --
and i , i 've been down to the south of england where supposedly king arthur 's castle was .
and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and , uh , took them about an , an hour to , um , figure out what was , what was blowing the fuse ,
so i ,
and , uh , she sends him to the principal 's office ,
but i 'm fine this week .
and i go , so what happened worldwide , you know .
and , uh , kids did n't fit in right then ,
-- either one of those two , you go through a hundred bucks without half trying ,
i do n't like that .
well , we buy things for the dorm , whatever the dorm needs , you know .
i do n't know quite how that works .
-- and i realize it 's my fault ,
and so i was always throwing my arm out and , uh ,
you know , you can come to south tyler where i live
and i said , well , i mailed you a check
going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something .
so they 're a little bit angry at me .
because it does , you know ,
i shall look into it .
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff .
and he is the president
-- and , uh , when we have , uh , a local election , say for our mayor and so forth --
-- and in my , in my earlier days as a student i kind of time shared on a dog with a , a good friend of mine
so i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am .
and ,
and he was telling me about it .
so she 's into this .
and , uh , i also like romantic novels .
and she 's , uh , working on this project too ,
well , my kids ' very favorite , and yours may be too young for it , was home alone .
right now it 's just a , a single level rambler .
it gets f , foamy almost .
we , have a half bath downstairs , too .
chicken fajitas and stuff .
it was very difficult .
and we can have a salad bar --
and she was so enthusiastic ,
the pa- , the paint 's peeling off of it ,
but --
they had no right to live .
-- and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home --
and so we , we 've been all over
well , i tell you , i , i firmly believe in exercising .
in santa barbara .
because they say they can spot check .
i do n't , i do n't like stephen king .
and , uh , boy that was , uh , really a mess back under there under the , in that van .
and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course , i had a electronics course i could take ,
a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail .
billy owens looks like he was ,
i thought that was kind of interesting too .
i work at a , for a university . uh , georgia tech , uh , research --
one of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through g m a c or something .
and the same to you .
but my wife did n't work
and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure .
which , in the paper , it 's just , uh , newspaper and corrugated cardboard .
and there 's , uh , there 's some different things , uh , one that you 've already mentioned is , is health insurance .
and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program .
-- and she 's just turned out to be a jewel .
now , my husband and all the men , i mean , they love the real competitiveness of playing for money , you know .
and we 'll say , wait a minute .
i have n't gotten ,
i 've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college --
and so we had the t v on
and , uh , i 'm just hoping that the broncos can get back on their feet .
and we 'd stay in people 's homes ,
we always , we had that bread that was , uh , um ,
and there are a lot of other churches ,
i , i just finally ended up going to see it , uh ,
i mean , it was terrible .
well , there 's water in the trinity .
our first
and he went to new york with them ,
uh , and i had help with them .
and then she played bass clarinet during concert band .
if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out .
i have n't gone back over there .
i grew up , uh , in the , the sixties ,
-- sometimes they do essentially nothing ,
i , i told my daughters in college this year , i said , this summer we 're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car .
it was real gray --
and we kind of got spoiled .
well sometimes i 'm home
and i really just keep very good records ,
and , uh , i , i ju- , i , i 'm probably one that has to agree with it too .
my parents were a lot like , too
and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group
of course they have absentee which is getting to be more , a lot easier ,
but they did the johnny angel .
and , uh , in fact , just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car .
at last , someone wants us to vote .
i 'm , you know ,
i live up in the , uh , northeast corner
and the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to .
i do n't think i can pronounce it either ,
there 's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that .
and he held three jobs . wally was in college
i do n't have any little tiny kids ,
-- and we 're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing ,
i usually vote .
and it really helps .
and my mother and i have talked about it , to how important it was when i came home from school .
i played flute for ,
i just hate that ,
i guess they could call them that , but they 're , they 're more just a screened in , uh , camping area --
at least in my own circles i 've been aware of an increasing from my generation ,
i would be impressed .
i do n't know , it 's kind of odd they pick ,
she finally admitted , you know , she finally told me it 's okay if you do n't ,
the golden delicious were fantastic this year .
my husband is a counselor ,
and , uh , around here on the , uh , east coast , uh ,
uh , there 's , uh , you know , they 're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create , you know , an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it
and so the insurance would cost lower ,
and yet , we have n't , as human beings , have n't figured out a way to harvest it economically --
it 's tough , uh , i think i would just stick with the classics . only because , uh , i like music just for music 's sake
i mean i sometimes get hooked into it ,
and that is , uh , and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race . uh ,
and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days .
i had no idea that he was like that .
i make more than my boss . because he 's salary and i 'm not .
well , the thing i think that annoys me the most is , i have , i have young children , a baby in the house
you have to call from another , a different ,
but the nature of the , uh , courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it 's a very long haul before anybody 's ever executed .
i know .
and , uh , so this little dog has plenty of room to run .
they stash away a good bit of money and come down here
well , like i told you before , mumblex .
and i thought , no ,
and we would n't mind going its extra effort to do it . uh ,
i 've never tried using that ,
and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where i am , here in texas ,
that , i would , that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was , you know , juggling payments to different people --
and i 've , i was always kind of nondescript in that category because i always liked dogs .
they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks --
they say like only one in ten are reported .
and the other is , uh , twenty , twenty-one .
or we go on trips , or , you know , just --
i was a , i was a boy scout .
they do .
i do n't know too much about it .
i 've got an , an olds toronado that , i think 's got six belts on the sucker .
so there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here .
or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already .
but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up .
me too .
but , uh , and they 're , you know , they 're right there on the creek also
uh , every major city had one theater that did it
we have n't quite decided if i 'm going to ,
plus , i find that i have to video tape quite a bit of things .
the three fifty regular gas engine .
but it 's hard to find , uh , an actual exercise regimen that work , for you , you know , because like i know a lot of people that cycle , they take their kids behind them on the bikes
so , his kids will sleep in the truck , in the , in the back of the bed .
and i like how it 's laid out
but that has to be ,
i , i , i live in a dorm --
we 're in maryland ,
and now we 've got the bag for the plastic bags .
it would n't be any kind of special , um , special effects type thing .
although you paid , what , almost two dollars now to get it
oh , uh , tonight i 'm looking forward to seeing golden girls .
it really was , it was great .
and , uh , we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now .
one day i gave her the checkbook
she 's in her late forties .
it 's a , a buick century .
i do n't know him .
oh , well , the channel catfish get up to , uh ,
i work in school . you know ,
and he was over there at , uh , the university of shah and , and teaching ...
uh , it depends .
and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags .
i 've got a , had a grandmother who had a stroke .
we kind of have a , an informal contest .
but , as far as , uh , trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing ,
i , i , i find it very strange .
i think he gets beat up even though he 's big , because he 's --
i think our next car , i would like something like a , an economy car that gets really good mileage and , uh , one that 's really reliable .
-- and , um , i 'm going to start with day trips , though , because i do n't know the territory and all ,
you can also do the same thing using , um , if you have ground beef .
she likes to spend ,
and , uh , when , when i was first here in , in dallas or in plano , um , and was finally able to , this is , oh , been like fourteen years ago we moved here . and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter , and i got an i b m selectric . i thought i had died and gone to heaven because ,
i 've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose ,
and , um , i had said ,
there 's no professional hockey teams in , in texas mumblex .
-- you work at t i ,
but most of the builders all built three , two .
i have no clue .
i was on a jury trial last year
i go every weekend .
you can wander ,
i like that term .
-- he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here
it 's , it 's one of the strange ,
once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he , um , someone invites him to lunch , he 'll , he 'll not go ,
that 's what i thought .
so , we do n't have any long term , you know , in stocks , or anything like that right now ,
he goes , uh , the problem was that there were five people saying row , row , row and one person rowing , right .
when i said i , i 'm , i 'm raising them , i am ,
uh , the rain man was one .
and those things just flat took over .
so we have , both of us have some money in an i r a that we 're also trying to figure ,
i 'd like to have an everyday contact with children , uh , as well as you do , for that matter ,
and i went ahead and pursued that .
like we 've gotten the last couple of days .
-- and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors .
this is the first reunion with my husband 's family i 've really been involved with ,
and they 'd say just look at this ,
my house kind of looks like two trailers put together .
if you 're , you know , a brick layer , somebody can look and see , you know , well , yeah , you laid , you know , fifteen thousand bricks today
uh , they 've got all the american , well , all the , all the cars rated , you know ,
well my husband 's from new jersey ,
and , and , she was , uh , taken care of by the proper facility .
i just force , i have to force myself to do it , like i said , because to me , i really do n't enjoy it .
well , my parents wanted to send me to college ,
terrible ice storm , uh , around this time of the year .
i never thought i would have
-- they were in the magnet school program ,
i do n't care what else you call them , you know ,
um , they , they also have a garden shop
but that 'll change --
one or two times in my life i 've ever had venison , i 've loved it .
and the law has no , no , uh , regulations to deal with that .
oh , well my favorite , well ,
i guess the one thing i do see that is , is that needs to be a solution is , that if you do let people into the country , i do feel you have a certain obligation to ,
people in jeans and in whatever ,
i 'm actually in the air division ,
and i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun .
i do n't smoke ,
but , um , i guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland .
there sure are .
and also , you know , then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a --
they always borrow a few of them .
and we 're just not real into the lawn probably because we 're renting , i guess , huh ?
and , but now we 've seen , you know , uh , black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and i guess all over than they did , you know , twenty years ago .
i think that , uh , i like that .
i have n't been in there .
i 'm wanting to go there .
well the s p thirty goes up to eight --
and , and it 's , so it 's business ,
obviously , there 's , uh , you know , there 's a lot to learn , uh , after that .
well , uh , uh , i am originally from west virginia .
i would n't have thought that pillsbury could , would , the , i mean , or even had chem- , you know , well ,
i , i , i do like , uh , u s news and world report .
and she 's been okay every since .
it 's called the missionary training center in utah ,
we moved here from enid , oklahoma .
i ca n't remember .
and i 'd have to go load it up the next day .
-- so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a wendy 's ,
always something to do .
and you can fill them up that way
we went on vacation couple months ago ,
and so he 's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke
-- uh , mumblex somebody was knocking on my door here .
but they 're not making new ones .
i just , you know --
i do n't know if i 've been spoiled .
there are , were some , uh , regulations over ,
but , uh , well , i guess that 's one i wo n't go see .
i would love to do that ,
if it comes on , i just happen to hear it .
you know . i did not , i did not go see field of dreams when it was in the theatre because i did not know it was any good .
and it 's sort of like that ,
i do n't know how long that takes , or --
i have no idea .
the other times , he 'll , uh , i do n't know go out somewhere ,
for myself , i mean , i think that military experience was fine ,
and i do n't know anybody in my immediate family that has , or , you know , has ever even thought about it .
uh , a professional could break in , in ,
and i really do n't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly .
we got invited to ,
and , uh , she 's , she 's a teacher
well , till you got crazy with it .
she was really funny .
i guess for a while i would use , you know , a variety of the visa and the mastercard and the stores ,
so , that , that , that 's a concern of mine as far as , uh , what i 'll be looking at with buying a new car .
the basketball season 's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks .
and it took us a lot longer
i think that 's the way it is , no , mine , i guess , if it 's full , it will not take it , i 'm not sure .
we spend a lot of time , uh , uh , carpooling and , uh , you know , and then trying to be , uh , up as much as possible with anything that they , that they do .
i like the , the , the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that .
rather , rather odd personality ,
i think japan , i think japan is probably about equal to ours --
i exercise pretty regularly .
i , uh , take a computer magazine .
we 've given up , between the fire ants , the pill bugs , the weeds , the drought , and a hundred and ten degree heat all summer , and
supposed to be .
um , most of them have pretty good facilities .
so we , um , we have a five year old ,
-- but it was , it was always fun .
i guess you would say the neighborhood road , it runs between the high school and the , the commercial districts
i mean we 're talking about what you think ,
and it 's , it , it 's pretty bad .
so , but i , i love mine ,
the more i verbalize it , i , i do not think i would want to change the system .
but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile .
i was , i was better off paying a state tax mo- , back in maryland , where , ,
i just , i go hysterical when they do n't come home .
and i think it has gotten more humid over the years .
-- and they have initiated a newspaper recycling --
and i bought a corvette
and , uh , one show that comes to mind is like designing women . uh ,
i guess it 's just where they , um , and like e d s reimburses you for adoption .
i , i , i , uh , was going to say cause i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it --
-- and it 's an eighty-five ,
she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning , water dripping from hers .
uh , that 's sort of the old testament version .
i 'm , i 'm a little disturbed about that ,
but then they , they tell me hell is much better than west texas .
it would n't be like a mountain .
-- but i have n't been to any games recently .
well , i would probably be a junkie or s- , watch c n n a lot ,
uh , mother is my best friend ,
it said think about long term repercussions
they , uh , just rent skates and stuff for the kids .
there 's a lot of , uh , people gotten laid off lately . you know , from just companies like general dynamics , and ,
some of the people --
i dropped , oh , i 'd say almost twenty pounds .
but , i guess , having done this all my life , i knew that there was n't a problem
well , we were lucky when our children were that age ,
she just does n't get paid for it .
turkey has the death penalty ,
i do n't remember doing all these things .
the , the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene , uh , when there 's a , my understanding , when there 's uh , a verdict
so , i 'm still using a three iron
it 's one of the chinese cooking basics .
so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff .
actually , um , because the circulation budget as high as it went , uh , covered , uh , a fairly remarkable amount
i , i like that
i , i ,
that bothers me a great deal ,
but not anymore .
i work at t i .
uh , everything else was fine ,
uh , it beats being laid off and everything .
i check the scores the next morning ,
you know , i have no choice --
and if they were n't spending all the money on drug testing , people could have got a raise .
he does ,
and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges --
but that never worked well .
i 'm at east carolina .
but i thought it , i thought it was in effect .
i am , uh , like a catholic
well , just go ahead and talk ,
my , my mind just went ,
in iowa , the state i am from --
and it 's a real different , uh , land and scenery than there .
we actually still do it with , with my wife 's salary ,
you know , my wife works
and i was , i was pretty disappointed in it
and it always made me feel a little bit , you know , a loner
but they did give it , you know , do it justice .
i have a nineteen eighty-six toyota , uh ,
it 's just not .
and now that i finally become proficient in samna everybody 's going to wordperfect .
i have people here that i know that have never registered to vote .
i mean the , the copyright is nineteen ninety-one ,
uh , i have four sons myself ,
like daisy , pops in once in a while ,
and they charge to ski on it .
i did n't .
but , you know , i do n't have enough time to do it to really , you know , take orders on it ,
well , i 'm in the computer biz too
he kept picking at it
-- and they said we were n't going to get any more for christmas .
and then you end up with a decimal , where you start getting into mils , and that sort of thing .
oh , i like scary ones that are realistic .
it was the same way ,
we do n't run into a lot of problems --
basically , i had read that they 're just looking at relocating them all to mckinney is it , texas ,
you know , husband and wife can , can live there too or , or whatever .
it was very interesting .
i mean , i do n't even remember how much money that they 've , uh , i mean , the money that they 've made from the recycling program .
they tend to try to be , you know , real lax
and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to , to actually sit down , because she does n't like doing things that the younger kids like doing .
oh , and , uh , what about bob ?
i , i 've heard a lot of people say that .
and , uh , on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres , i think ,
that 's , um , i 've found that when i , i do n't have cable television anymore , uh , when i moved , went back to graduate school i just did n't have the money to buy , ge , rent a cable t v line , or whatever , you know .
we went , uh , early on sunday .
and , uh , he 's recently moved here
i got , when i got mine i had an internal modem in it --
well brent , i 've been , um , i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought , uh , if it , it 's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school .
well , i hope so .
we 've been to , um , chefalia 's .
so i 'm always asking where , where in the state , you know , the person is from if they 're in texas .
and it 's a fairly large one to ,
see i joined , uh , when this one down here opened up , i joined as a v i p .
because , uh , i drive out of town a lot of the weekends --
that 's about it .
it 's worth the shine ,
either that or mercedes , just because they 're put together so well .
and --
and then when you drive home , like especially if you 're in a lot of traffic --
i 've got the phones for lunch hour .
uh , i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep .
and i 've always bought them new .
that was in the northern p- , um , up near cumberland mall area .
i 'm not home then ,
i did n't buy them when my kids were little .
she started recycling cans
i did it as she said ,
i do n't know how many american jobs they are really taking away .
and the kids just fell in love with it .
other than that , it got terrible mileage
and then one by one , his broth- , you know , his sisters , he began to lose family members ,
but i , i 've never owned a cat like that .
-- that she can watch , but wo n't take too much care .
doctor haggard is , is heading that up .
i 'm brown belt in karate ,
i think the mormon church has , sends out missionaries that ,
these teachers as far as i 'm concerned are absolute saints , because in second grade , it was about the second week of school , i went up there ,
and , uh , so if , if there 's no one else around , you know , it 's just me and i have a chance to listen to something , i 'll turn that on , but , uh , just for the , for the conversation factor , i think ,
i know i 've taken several vacations to colorado ,
and he , uh , saved himself in the , in the , in the process also .
you call ,
of course , their , their ages , they are almost seventeen --
but then this summer we went to orlando for a week ,
and we used to go , just every weekend just to look at houses , for no reason , we were n't buying one every weekend , but just to look at them .
because your normal companies that offer it , do not offer it in the amounts that we do
i mean , we 'll , our neighbors , the attached on the other side , they 're very nice , thank god ,
i do n't either .
i do n't know ,
well even if it 's life , like you say , we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some , you know , joker in there for life .
especially between women and ,
i 've got two , as i said , i 've at u t now in austin , and one at home ,
i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in , uh , philadelphia .
the fourth one you could n't get to lineup no matter what you did .
but i 've never had any problem with , um , my mercury ,
and ,
i missed that question , totally , i mean really bad .
-- and i watched the news ,
well , they 've , i 've talked to some people from cleveland
we do n't , we , we were n't sure how to do that
i can take all kinds of music pretty much --
and i do n't do anything to mine , water them or anything .
but we still felt the thick blame for ,
but , uh , you know , most people i knew have gone and got their degree .
there is more energy in it per pound or whatever .
i know ,
but i did exceeding well .
i mean , we did it couple of hundred years ago here ,
and we have to bring the paper bags back every time .
my job kind of hinders me from exercising .
when we working out we ate out more than that .
the , the interior was still really nice ,
so , i understand that , it 's , it 's kind of hard to go do .
in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for t i ,
she , uh , she likes to , um , she does n't like the beef dishes .
in fact , i 'm graduating from college in about a week
because i think about that a lot ,
it 's by , uh ,
and then you get one examine for the whole semester --
but they have so much food that you , not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself , you end up eating much more than you need .
it was n't jane eyre .
and he has played .
so , um , when we came back to texas , i was really kind of excited .
um , he was in the untouchables , too .
and it 's not going to cost me an arm and a leg , really .
so , i , i 'm jerry hammond
i mean she understood everything .
-- marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives and some , and some prunes , uh ,
i know what family home evening 's all about .
but that was the big joke , the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax .
so a good portion of her , you know , her salary is , is quarterly bonuses .
well , the , the , you know , those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way
-- but that 's because my mother-in-law takes every one they print and gives them to me ,
but now i 've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me .
i got my four year ,
and then i 've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude , you know .
she had to have , you know , twenty-four hour a day care .
we just do n't drink that many .
and so ,
country western , uh , i 'm not quite as big on that .
well , they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison ,
and ,
my wife has a volvo
i 've never done potato .
but as it turned out , he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals .
they went like one and six ,
well , i have a town home ,
oh , because we 're in dallas .
i- , it left the , it left , he left the chips ,
uh , there , well , there 's a little bit of difference in , in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law .
it 's never ran ,
it 's good for another thirty years .
she has been talk , has talked about quitting , you know , and staying home for a few years .
but i used to work and , when i had two children .
that was before the , uh , uh , they adopted the death law again .
i 'm not really sure what the county ,
she said , i like the original version better .
it was al- , almost always at least one cat , sometimes , you know , like fifteen or twenty . but , uh , always cats in the house .
he , uh , had moved , uh ,
and it was just a real problem .
and i was told you do n't need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children ,
and i 've been keeping up with the saints a lot .
but i do n't like , i do n't like it dirty .
you 're correct .
i really do n't know what 's going to take place with the cowboys this year .
i love --
and they have a program , uh , in , that was devised by this montessori person
i 'd say we probably have within fifteen miles , twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course , pine hurst
and i was impressed with the fact that , um , it was n't that childish .
and he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies .
and they 're tired of it ,
he 's about five months old
and it 's called shoeless joe .
and they are , one ...
and , and so , um , but , but when you go to order a drink , um , you know . mumblex say , they , they , i do n't know , it 's uh ...
-- and , uh , so --
as a matter of fact , i just paid my richardson taxes because i live in richardson and supplemented the robin hoods very thoroughly , i think .
i , i definitely do ,
well , mostly , uh , a , a little fresh water fish ,
i know where that is .
it is a time consumer .
i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time , uh , i might take up , there is , i would love to cross-stitch .
and i go , gee , how did they form , you know , so perfect like that .
we could have sent , uh , her to a fancier , uh , facility .
so she told us that the house had been , uh , professionally painted recently .
my daughter had a , like a little goldfish ,
we did n't have ,
uh ,
but i 'm not a real avid camper , uh ,
-- but it 's pretty congested .
but this one guy next to me , who 's not here just so i could talk about him ,
i enjoyed it .
but that 's one that , that we watch .
um , he said , well , these people here are , they are very nice to her .
my boss just bought a , a pick up truck ,
and then it had , a little bit darker sort of peachy color ,
so that was real nice .
you have so much summer .
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a , a , you know , a , a nuisance . or worse than a nuisance ,
it was tough ,
they do n't have children yet ,
i like to watch a lot of news , um ,
we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus .
but garland has got a real big recycling center that , in fact , we went to it yesterday .
and i 've been watching them every day
we were quite pleased with the result .
-- hobbies .
but here , basically , you go to an italian restaurant or you go to a mexican restaurant ,
-- but we , it was never , my brothers , sisters nor i never , i mean none of us ever thought well let 's go look at the gun
i , at the moment , use an a s t two eighty-six
we have a ,
and , so , we were going down ,
it 's just gorgeous over there .
-- because i 've only ridden in the one ,
oh the , the carpet place that called me three times ,
now they 're starting to recycle that stuff .
so it 's a nice change .
-- uh , he 's a big gene wilder fan ,
i hate to see that ,
and it always would , it always would increase , you know ,
-- and our class ,
and , uh , i do n't think we really even want to find out .
well , i , uh , i give to the united way
the , the , the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here ,
i see it a lot in my daughter .
when you get one way out like that
so , um , well , i 'm not sure how long we 've talked .
we gave , we give , uh , two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids , uh , who we think were worthy , you know
you know , i mean , that 's the kind of things , you know , that she 's keeping and showing , that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it was a waste , you know --
i bowl
so , he had his year this year ,
but , you know , if he had the preference , i mean his , his preference is , um , blue jeans and a t-shirt ,
i , i used to go to a gym , um , last summer ,
-- so all the monies are donated , you know ,
my understanding is what they 're try , what , what supposedly they 're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes , they 'll have more money to spend , uh ,
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom .
but it just builds up ,
they think they need to , maybe have , uh , you know , private , you know , business , private enterprise come in .
you know . you like to pull for the underdog
and it 's made with red wine and ,
i worked in , um , in all the different areas of the day care center
they always stayed at home until they got married ,
so she 's uh , fiscally she 's pretty tight , and , uh , she 's cleaning house
but i do n't actually play golf .
um , i know working for small corporations
i , i 'm ready to go .
i , i ca n't ,
i think it was an hour .
my teenage years were spent during the sixties ,
well , our kids , you know ,
other than gardening which i fiddle at ,
but i still like watching him in the terminator .
they finally started making zucchini ,
and they like rain ,
and the one boy killed himself a few years ago , in the , in a grade school ,
um , i got money to pay that , too .
and then they would n't think .
but , uh , it 's , it 's camping .
and , uh , you also get , you know ,
we have a three bedroom house .
and i 've also driven one at a , something mazda put on where , uh , they went to , uh , autocross events across the country . uh , which is where you race in , uh , you race on , in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of , uh , cones to see who can get through the fastest .
we used to get four or five inches a year .
i know , i 've been talking to people in ohio , and , uh , virginia , and i think , california .
it was wonderful ,
-- and the other part of her family was up in , uh , new york state .
i went for a couple
from speaking from my children , the- , they are n't real flexible when it comes to things like that .
that 's another topic .
maybe someday i 'll , i 'll get back to that as , after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end , weekend or something .
i know right away what we , what we want .
i call on oshman 's sporting goods , again , it may be casual or it may be coat and tie .
and , you know , and , and they , and we did n't have power for a week
and he had dysplasia --
well , sometimes , even with that . i , i think you have to have some ,
thirty years ago i , i had a college job , uh , working as a programmer
i play in three different symphony orchestras .
uh , let 's see before i had this car i had a , um , i bought an audi five thousand --
i 'm going to try pressing one again to make sure --
i 'm , i 'm not into , uh , heavy government legislate- , legislating of a lot of different areas ,
i mean , no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot .
but i occasionally , if no one 's looking --
i have n't heard , i had n't heard much about that movie .
i happen to r , just read something the other day at least in the boston paper there were three things that , that come to note .
and , but he 's was trying to make it in the sprinter 's event ,
well , when i came home , i opened the door
and we 've all got heaters in our tents .
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it did n't , that , that , um , the indians all appeared to be wearing new things .
and , and it 's , it was kind of a long story ,
but , uh , even the small towns now though , has really changed from when i was a kid ,
and , and they basically , uh , type out abstracts which are really literally ,
i have not .
they , you know , you just pay that admission ,
and , boy , i ca n't think of the other one that 's fixing to come out .
it 's just solid sandstone .
-- um , uh , it was the , it 's one of the best movies i 've seen in a long time .
it 's , uh , you know , it all starts to become similar
but the first couple of years it does n't matter to me what the quality of the education was .
so that would be neat to ,
and just the social values ,
he would n't go howl ,
well , it held our pan and , you know , the potatoes and stuff .
but in this particular lake , we went out with some friends , once
and it 's overcrowded .
uh , as a matter fact , i work out in the mornings .
and , th- , the things i 'm finding out are the in terms of things like privacy , the way the law is interpreted , presented ,
and , uh , just recently , uh , we , we set up a budget ,
and he would probably be flying , is what he would be doing .
a , a rose family by faulkner . that 's one of my favorites .
how important you think that would be .
if somebody gets the death penalty , they 're , they 're judged guilty ,
sac .
and i learned wordstar on that ,
but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it .
well , i like them in between .
uh , th- , that , that 's mostly what i hear , though , is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen .
if i come in in a dress , everybody 's shocked .
i said i have very few vices ,
you know , it 's at home , i can , i can do some of my reading ,
uh , well i , actually my dad 's , my dad 's almost ninety
and i have a money market account also .
i do ,
she is not a good housekeeper .
uh , well , i do n't pretend to understand that either .
and , and the judge gave the woman who shot her , shot the girl a , uh , uh , practically a suspended sentence .
-- of course they wanted to see it .
and oh i have gone to , uh , oh , like , uh , oh , these gyms , you know that the , like in plano and richardson and , uh , where they offer the , uh , rec centers really --
i tend to , to view it ,
i forgot what her name is now .
they have these little blue bins .
or they switch a lot , which is not good for the child either .
we said , `` please let us know if you 're coming . ''
and we do n't see the sun
i just , oh , my feet bother me ,
i know .
once she 's gone , i 'm not sure if i 'll get another animal or not .
well , i know that i learned how to knit one time and , um , made a few things
if , if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who , murdered who , or stole what .
like we had some job offers in the new york area ,
well i find that i , whenever i have to , whenever i 'm in a group of people and we 're discussing things ,
but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should .
i did work in government .
and , and now , all of a sudden , it , uh , comes in differently ,
i had a , uh , i had a business going .
but , they 're just things ,
mostly it 's been at lunch time --
i do n't know , uh ,
but it 's not like it is in the spring time .
and now all of a sudden they 're going home
and , um , it was good and everything ,
and , uh , if i could n't have my luxury maxima --
they 've got to have them there to be able to milk them .
i 've never quite seen waves like this one --
i 'm more , uh , old rock and roll , uh , some new , newer , i guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type --
and so she basically did n't use credit cards and did n't know very much about them and how they work ,
and so i do that .
i was going to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue .
course , it 's a standing joke , you know , when the , when the men come in in a , a tie and a suit coat , you say , you know , what , have you got a job interview today
he will do that , to research it and to be able to mimic a person , uh , uh , with the kinds of problems that he had .
was really a lot of fun
they 're both very good .
and i , i can actually n , could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this .
and they had curbside recycling ,
but i never did , uh .
but then someone comes along and says you ca n't do that , you know .
and i , and i 'd tell him , you know , it 's getting ready to fall out ,
but it is not dry .
but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry .
i ca n't even go grocery shopping right now --
at least you guys have a remote control .
-- they thrash around ,
the last one was back down to lubbock , texas ,
and i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that ,
they use joe blow 's so , uh , social security number , uh , and can , uh , potentially ruin someone 's credit .
uh , he 's thirty-seven
we , we do have a little information on it here ,
it 's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three ,
we have , we have gone through , what might be called the four seasons , uh , in the last week .
-- and , and there is a pond ,
and he 'll go pick them up because he just ca n't stand that .
and we 'd put up houses .
well , or even a lake .
after about eighteen months of talking about the --
of course i 'm in facilities ,
it 's just been so long since i 've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that .
you know , once it rains a little bit , it 's , it 's filled up and everything else just runs off ,
but --
-- it is hard .
now see , we think of classic rock that they , you know , have on all the easy listening stations now --
oh , pretty much anything .
their aluminum cans is for , uh , children 's hospital , for a burn fund --
i do n't know what you want to call them , fake --
oh . ours are pretty calm .
i , i like especially ,
so , and i 'm working , too ,
kind of , uh , little guy in there .
you know , you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza
anyway , it 's fixed ,
that 's kind of how my husband and i are .
you know , social change in california means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work .
i never got into them .
a lot of people changed around there
it keeps me pretty busy ,
i think i have heard about that .
when you hear people say , it , it alters your life forever , please take heed , well ,
i did n't get out this year ,
i mean , like i used to be more , uh , conservative and just your basic colors ,
i think it 's wonderful .
the thing is i know a lot of stories ,
it 's not a senior citizens home .
you know , i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it ,
but , um , if there is , uh , we probably could do something about it now ,
i used to until it , i got so allergic to it .
in fact , i do n't know what the statistics were ,
and you 've got a short term loan .
it rides , rides rough ,
my first job years ago , uh , thirty years ago , twenty-nine years ago , in fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer .
um , you know , lot of the big name brand , i guess , uh , chains --
uh , he 'd come in there as a stray .
i married into a military family ,
so the men mainly stayed
and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive ,
and it was in real nice condition so , because apparently whatever the bank get ...
and , uh .
but i do n't know if i 'll get myself to spend that kind of money ,
well , um probably the best one that i , i know of and i work with all the time is called search for significance --
we played christmas about an hour out in this mall .
uh- , well , about nursing homes ,
it 's the strangest , weirdest thing in the world ,
i would n't have thought so either .
but , uh , i , i keep hearing all the stories of , of different parts of town .
i mean , i , i have like two pairs of pants , because i can never find any that are short enough for me --
i 'm looking , right now i 'm k- , kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate .
but , uh , i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way .
but , uh , you know ,
and she 's lived with us for like five years .
when they go , it 's on business --
i was in germany , you know , for several years --
it looked to me like it was a real submarine ,
and so , uh , i bought a used yugo --
i do n't , ca n't remember how many years they had that car ,
but i want to show him how to use it so that he 'll be --
and they 've really enjoyed it .
that 's , that was , uh , that 's always been our next step .
i , i did grow up with david brinkley . uh ,
so and that was before we got married ,
they just came down and like say , okay , this aunt and uncle kip , uh , all their kids and their grand kids and everything ,
um , our friends in houston bred the dogs .
but i had to beg off from the duty .
it 's been about a year .
and it is n't because of the , well ,
so i do n't have , you know , i do n't know that much about it ,
we had a falling out ,
and so if i just use time
and there 's a section in south dallas that 's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain .
i was just pissed as hell that they could do that .
and the , um , the neighborhood actually fought him on it ,
and that , um , they put her there ,
the creek overflows
our neighbors had flooding ,
i mean i do go to church and things .
i thought well --
i 'd go now , now which one could that be --
a little bit sweeter .
well , when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door .
i only missed it about three times .
really good temperament and very playful and affectionate , good personality .
he can eat like a horse , too .
she knew my mom by name
-- and , uh , i saw on t v , they had a program on , uh , credit cards
i 'm sure .
now he is watching honey , i shrunk the kids right now .
i have a sister who used to live in kennesaw , georgia .
i remember us , i used to work at , uh , kentucky fried chicken .
but i know that it 's very difficult to , to find good help sometimes when and especially when your , when you want your children to be taken care of .
one sears .
you can just go buy one and take it home
you know when he is in the house , he will come up and he 'll jump on his lap ,
they do n't want to be around you .
well , it 's really a
well , we have just --
that , uh , her sister got killed
and , uh , and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance
so , uh , but , it , even though , uh , it was n't hunting season ,
but the bass ,
not any more .
i do n't .
well , the first year after --
i wish i had a boat ,
-- and they paid for everything .
i figure , well , i should go see it , because if this is , you know , the best of the genre and i should know about it , or something like that --
but i , i , i do n't , i do n't have a problem with them too much , testing even after the fact ,
but i 'm not , not kind , not the , uh , the , you know , dial around randomly trying to break into computers type --
and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw .
like in nicaragua , i am familiar with that because we have , uh , some friends that live on the nicaraguan border
and i 'll lay those on top of my salad , you know , to make it look nice and things like that .
well , he 's still in korea and his buddies home now .
she has very , very black and white opinions , you know .
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape , you know , if any one wants to listen .
so , depending on what my class schedule looks like , he may spend four , si- , anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point .
and , and , uh , i 'm seeing more and more of that ,
so , uh , she 's , she 's not , uh ,
um , right now , the district ,
you know , i , i attended a trial in , uh , germany when i was a student
up , upstate new york somewhere ,
i 've , i 've gotten , i 've gotten a lot more away from , from credit cards ,
and she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse
we started about , new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious .
i 'd rather have , have more rooms and less space in each one i guess . rather have lots of rooms and lot- , lots of space ,
and i did not order out a lot ,
and i loved it .
-- um , and , uh , i did get one summons actually at one point ,
she has an office
that 's near dallas .
that 's it , i mean , that 's about where almost all of the fat comes from --
it was not too long ago .
and most of the time i hear myself saying
so we used it a bit ,
so he held up the seven eleven .
so i 've seen ,
i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line .
that 's --
and there 's , they 're starting to get a little bit different , um ,
we never mumblex any more .
and , uh , you know , and it was supposed to be a base ,
my brother-in-law is director of admissions at the university of texas --
and they were impressive .
oh toronto 's only about two hours ,
he just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the h- , air , the heat came up out of the dryer , you know .
and , uh , that 's worked pretty well .
we 're not on the subject . of course ,
so i just sub at the school ,
and they said it is a fish product .
and , and i think they 've got a comp- , uh , some kind of container for aluminum .
well , the national enquirer says .
i do n't know what that is .
so , um , i think i 'm mumblex in handicraft .
and we freeze a lot of that ,
and if it comes up negative , okay , fine ,
uh , l i t e , like , uh , uh , things that are n't as heavy a meal .
it was a job interview
if i start into something and i really enjoy what i 'm reading ,
my mother , well , she 's like seventy-four now .
and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff
and they 'll match it .
and i , you know , i 'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place .
i mean , he 's just like in a world of his own ,
and one of the things was to kill the rabbit , kill the rabbit --
so it will probably workout real nice for us , uh ,
and i 've got two girls , also ,
two years ago i spent some fourth of july to labor day on a jury that was , uh , a change of venue from columbus , ohio for aggravated , uh , murder and kidnapping .
her name was rita at china tours in boston .
and i do n't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in ,
and one , one of the kindest people i 've ever met in my whole life , um , is from that area of the country
average human beings like you and i , average joes , that make a decent salary ,
the money will be available ,
but they can certainly , uh , block your answering machine so someone else calls you , uh , and your answering machine is full , you know ,
i 've lost track .
i live in the dallas area , but i go down to austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine --
and they were just screening some candidates ,
anyway , you know , the point was , what happens when public education fails ?
well , they , they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time .
just in particular here in the twin cities we have a lot of big corporations
because when the kids first went down , i said , that , you know that 's great
oh , they turn them over to somebody
so . i named her rosebud ,
so it 's not , um , what you would find , uh , where you live .
and the whole idea was , um , presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person , and , and , a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy ,
and , and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge . along with my trip to japan --
i never --
but , uh , i 've , i 've had considerable experience .
and he has , i would say , he adjusted very well
well that sounds , you sound just like my husband .
that 's what they do .
she lived by herself .
and i put it in parenthesis .
my sister just had a baby
so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian ,
-- unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals , there are more policemen --
and , uh , i was just absolutely shocked , uh , the first time that i saw his schoolwork .
i hated to leave it .
and now , i went back to work about a year and a half ago
so that adds to it --
matter of fact , if i find a , uh , a , a fly running around in the house , i pick him up and carry him outdoors .
and , uh , it changes every year .
i was from illinois ,
it is .
-- but that was in a more of a , a setting where there was a number of people around ,
think someone can do it .
but there 's probably something else that might make you .
i mean , my , uh , brother-in-law is like , uh , i mean he 's sixty .
it goes from winter to summer , usually .
i actually during that period of time from , you know , usually from six o'clock or six thirty , whenever i get home , until eight or so , i will shut off the phone --
well , i think , i think basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition .
but , i know , that , um , for a lot of the civil cases it 's rare ,
just two or three houses a week at the most .
but drugs is , in texas , are extremely bad .
but , um , even when i was pregnant , of course i listened to that ,
i 'm just real curious .
i 've ,
so it 's , yeah , it 's not really a local , you know ,
and i did n't really ,
but we 've gotten to know each other quite well , um , in , on a , a social level ,
uh , issues are being raised prematurely in my mind .
but you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled
but , uh , they 're kind of fun to , to try ,
she lives in garland
and we found what we thought was just an old water hole .
not too bad . uh .
-- kuwait was the nonaggressor --
-- and , uh , of course , there 's lots of mountains around there to camp in , and , and streams and stuff .
but i just looked at the picture and thought , what a world .
-- i 'm , i 'm very much aware of that .
it was nicer than dallas ' ,
so he 's out of daycare .
i guess the question in my mind somewhat
it 's just , they 're the most resilient little characters
i 'm , i 'm only about , uh , twelve miles or so from the , uh , border of washington d c , and montgomery county ,
but i want to start ,
but i know that i go to the grocery store that we always stick within , you know , five dollars between here and there .
he really should have hired people .
i ca n't remember what her name is ,
and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to , maybe , seven or eight children .
-- or you ca n't get a deer license .
and he ca n't speak a word .
i did n't --
it would certainly be an interesting test --
and so i 'm into computers all the time .
um , i started at the beginning of this year ,
but normally we do n't think about it until ,
well , i 'm kind of leaning towards , i do n't know , i 'm thinking about what , from one to ten what my no would be .
and , uh , for many years i grew sweet corn ,
i 'm ki- , i 've kind of like developed a , a short hatred for , for pop .
and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov- , and bring them over .
more money , actually , um ,
you can ,
west --
and you do actually camp .
i helped someone repaint an apartment ,
i resp , i respect them and what their capabilities are .
i have three left in the house .
one time i picked up this little boy who was crying
oh , you sound very young --
the brits were there .
dead zone .
and the men that drive the trucks --
well , you know , the only call i really got that , well , was out of state ,
with the american express card from t i ,
well , it , it see- , sure seems to save lives
but , but taking what you 're saying at face value , then i would have to agree with completely .
and there 's a lot of mexican people too . which is not , neither here nor there ,
and i hate it .
i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time .
so , really housing is real bad .
and they just said , oh , you can get by ,
but that may just be because i 've changed .
i wish , i wish we had something .
and i know , because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference --
and i could n't figure what was going on half the time ,
and so she knew that i had the time and would be , would enjoy it .
and this guy is indicted on three of them .
my wife 's from down in that region around the s- , the , called the , the seven missions which are , which are right down in this , where i 'm sure where it was filmed at .
um . if they did , they 'd still have to pay his contract .
but they keep asking these questions
i am , uh , i 'm just starting to get into , uh , a little bit more communications now .
and i have , have done , uh , gone to work for american heart and just recently for the leukemia society .
kids have ,
god , i do n't know .
in a way that happened this past season ,
well , i , i have n't been to beirut
we are just not willing to get up that high .
most of the time when i do n't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work , you know , and then fill it up ,
they have some wonderful camping areas there .
he says , well , i think this is what it is ,
oh , i could n't even tell you .
it may not in all ways .
the other thing he does , that my husband a real stickler about is we do n't collect our grass clippings .
and i 'm not really that great at it
because if you were n't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing , they could , they had freedom to just walk around
but , um ,
seventeen years .
they love to sit in front of the t v ,
but overall , um , i 've been pleased with it over the years .
well , i think we 're narrowing it down , actually .
it did n't cause her any problems with her job
they have , uh , uh , a place , i guess that would be similar to prime air .
and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life .
i ,
so i thought that would be easy for me to make
and he said , mom , do n't do that to me ,
or they have on saturday night , friday night and saturday night --
and everybody there , you know , are all software engineers .
he said , i do n't think that 's the different kinds of fishing they 're talking about .
she 's very old fashioned .
and we were young
but ,
dirty dancing and crossing delancy are two of my favorite .
so that 's why i 've kept active in that way .
i think that , uh , we probably will have to have , have to , uh , have a state income tax because , uh , texans do n't approve of such things as lotteries , uh , well i , i , come here from new york
so , we 're kind of country but not too .
i think that 's , that 's a good way to do it .
and the kids can pet animals and stuff .
they 're not really that bad
so , uh , i used to deal with ,
because , i mean , purdue , even though they 're one of the few schools that really , uh , stress academics , they 're suffering , you know
oh , i 'm with you ,
and this is something that i see .
one of our other real problems with going out to eat , sunday morning brunches .
so , you know , i do n't know it 's , i do n't know that that trend 's going to change the single parent type families
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town
they certainly enjoy that part of it .
i mean , it really does .
and it got wrecked ,
there 's a team in london
and then , in addition , i paid a little bit extra .
um , i think i 'm down to one .
and --
and then in concert band i played the bass clarinet .
i take away a , uh , addiction .
we put her in another one that i , i went a couple of times --
and , um , i play racquetball ,
well that , that 's what ended up being the real problem on this , was the , uh , i- , the , the pipe was n't busted ,
i do n't have the numbers in my head right now ,
something was very , very wrong with the blade .
that 's what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor
uh , i had a razor that i got from christmas that i just , i really did n't want it ,
and i got her when she was , you know , just this tiniest little thing like ,
but i 've never actually even made it into the , the jury box .
so , i still throw away a lot of glass .
but , uh , it , it was only like a couple dollars to get in
um , but we do get an awful lot of music , you know ,
so you can make a barbecue .
they 've got three daughters .
and , uh , he 's pleased with his classes .
we had lived out , um , west of san antonio , in castroville ,
and i thought it was good .
and i kind of like having a pickup truck .
and i can remember being in , uh , in these earthquakes
well i think , uh , the dr- , the laws on , uh , uh , uh , the first morphine laws were , were like ninety , or nineteen ten or nineteen five , something like that .
i 've done those too , before ,
you got to make money .
sometimes he bri- , he brought home a , uh , a portable one ,
but i do n't like using them because i 've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on ,
it , it 's , like i say , i work in a machine shop
and those are only available at t i .
several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day --
uh , mostly from t v too .
you can always tear stuff out and redo it .
shrimp , shrimp fettucini is real easy --
and i thought if i do that , i might not have a job
and like , our cats never went outside ,
so it 's worked pretty well .
any basketball that i like ,
i 've been getting mine .
-- i have to say that .
so , you 're a little bit more careful about what you put on that ,
i had n't thought of that .
they were saying something about this may be his last year with the rangers though .
and , course , the , the sequoias and the redwoods and , and you get up into bryce canyon and yellowstone
uh , my husband works for , uh , texas instruments .
it depends on the location .
it was a pilot program i think , where she lived ,
-- and , uh , he told me that there 're a lot of , uh , lot of counts against the canadian system , which is basically the one people are talking about for here .
i mean , if you do n't mind reading subtitles ,
it 's , it 's before .
word processing obviously .
it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block .
she loves it .
in fact , it 's said that no indian language has a word for privacy ,
and one is eleven .
uh , now i know that , that , uh , they 've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years ,
lot of time spent with her ,
because no financial gains are available for doctors .
and finally , the day we declared war was my time .
but , i do n't know , i have n't been as ,
it took , it took a while to do .
i mean , i , i could n't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder .
i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top
uh , deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother .
our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions , um , you know , is to ,
now we get channel fifty-five , although we do not have cable ,
-- and so we really only have one dallas newspaper and one ,
well , i , i was with t i until january .
we , i really did n't have to work ,
normally i talk to people in plano , texas .
we 're kind of past having to provide child care .
and , uh , and then , uh , i hurt my neck , uh , about three years ago .
i could never get the hang of it .
but on the other hand , uh , uh , you know , i do n't , i do n't know if it 's that is , that is that serious that they 're really never going to be out of jail , uh ...
you know --
i used , uh , when i was , uh , working in florida , i used to do a lot of surf fishing --
well , i was kind of hoping with ,
and i , and i still , i like to bowl ,
it 's just not that pleasant .
not right now , of course --
i took them up here to collectors rector- , records and was able to get a little money for them --
at that , it 's pretty easy to do .
but , i just do n't understand ,
i guess there 's science place one and science place two .
and , of course , the kids say , then why bother , just let me wear what i want .
course it , it has all of those qualities
i have book shelves
but they 're a little heavier
we do n't have children ,
and one of the things mumblex
so i , overall , i think i would rather hear just straight reporting .
-- and you know , then , then we , then i started playing with apples , you know ,
that 's even harder .
and he said , uh , a booster , uh , every year or two ,
they just went through a course , uh , and took the electronic grafting course ,
-- so that 's close , you know ,
and we put that over rice .
but the , the united states , uh , had some ,
and the way it 's being used now , it 's like you listen to bush is , you know ,
but , uh , i mean like whenever i , i was growing up and all , my mom ,
i was working a twelve hour shift ,
and she 'd just lay there on that step and just , you know , cool off .
i , i like it .
and he 's in school ,
i , uh , i do n't mind it ,
and they live in this old house --
and ,
and it was a very difficult choice
i mean , uh , a lot of people use human factors ,
but i only get that once a month .
i used to live abroad ,
i ca n't really think of anything that invades my privacy ,
i , i do , i do listen to a lot of ,
so --
and , as the years go on , the tow trucks got better , more easier ,
and , but i agree with you --
but it 's probably going to take me longer , because i did n't decide to major in that until , uh , about a year and a half after i was already in school ,
and , when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house , there were no trees --
-- it was about twenty-six to one .
the baltimore sun has this , uh , cartoonist in the sports section
-- you know , i saw something on c n n or on cable here --
so i 'll be able to --
i 'm familiar with that one .
uh --
i also , i play a couple of instruments .
i mean it just --
and it 's already dark unless it 's summer time , you know .
and , of course , the town thinks he 's just terrible , because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he 's broken it .
i know my brother does n't
that 's true .
so we , when we go , we have about , do about fifteen miles a week ,
the methodist church in richardson .
and , uh , and that sort of forced them .
we try hard ,
i 'm a sophomore .
and the , the , the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open
well , i read that ,
because i jump on the bike here at home .
well , i , i work for , uh , actually probably similar kind of place .
but , but then we have n't needed to either ,
but , uh , it , it quit working
you do n't spend it .
we 're supposed to talk about lawn and garden .
so first thing i think of is how easy would this ,
and , you know , he and his wife just went off to visit her
i mean ,
it was already setup when we bought it .
it 's where skillman , uh , curves into forest lane --
because when georgetown was number one ,
for that you put ,
but the thing about the child care i , you know , i have friends that struggle financially and , and they both do have to work .
i would i would like to , too ,
and they were very happy with the system ,
it 's , well , it 's more psychology and engineering .
i think i 'm going to like golf mumblex the older i get ,
but basically people kind of have a small apartment
the , the title sounds familiar ,
if it finally gets to that point .
of course , we wear , uh , an unlined boots , you know ,
i , i do have two daughters that , you know , out , they 're , they 're grown now though .
and the old people can not take it anymore .
so i do n't really have a lot of , uh , concrete , uh , opinions .
and i use , um , the graphics --
i 've , i 've seen it , uh ,
but we , we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us .
i 'm doing that more and more than i used to --
i remember when i was in school , i did horrible up until about ,
and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing .
and we left a day early ,
i , i almost want to start a business doing it ,
and i know in the state we were from that they did that t- , similar type thing .
it went pretty good .
-- and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it .
but you just , when you walk up to them they 're covered with thorns .
and , um , i have one son who 's almost sixteen months old .
ac- , ac- , actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we 've moved to california
we are just beginning .
it gets excellent gas mileage .
we live here also ,
that they 're structuring it with ,
but there 's a lot of people that , uh , you know , are band directors at schools , or have been ,
oh , i , i did n't really know that ,
so , it 's pretty nice .
a few ,
my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall --
it 's kind of , you 're on your own .
high schools , i 'm not too sure .
so i , well , i had been sick
and then jan hooks has taken charlene 's part .
he 's about a year and a half younger .
well , the people i know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that , you know , after initially finding out where people stand , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is a , you know , something like a nine , three or , or more severe and , and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they 're right --
you know , it 's not something that 's continual because , you know , the television ratings do n't come out , you know , all the time .
and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends .
i mean , i do n't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen .
and the landlord cut it down and said , yeah , that 's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it does n't rub up against the siding --
and it 's real neat .
but not many people can afford ,
that 's the kind of training i 've had .
some of the people that have been involved with peace corps , among other things , were retired teachers .
and , uh , they 've only deliberated four hours or ,
i do n't know of any other state , um , does not have a , a state income tax --
but , uh , my mind has gone blank .
i think that 's , well , that 's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much , is that not only do we sing wonderful music ,
it 's almost like the night court we see on t v .
i 'd get lettuce at the store
well , we got , um , a lot of , uh , european dishes .
they liked it .
we already have new bills printed , for ,
and when we were in high school it was always fun .
my husband got his doctorate at b y u ,
it 's , it 's a beautiful drive .
i , i guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something .
but it 's been , uh , a demonstrator model --
she likes to really get into her pumpkins
-- you know , so , uh , that 's worked out good .
-- and , uh , i think because she is , uh , the only child that they concentrate , uh , they would like to have more ,
and when we bought this house , we looked at doing a fifteen year note , because it added more to the payment ,
and , and they look real pretty after the rain .
so i think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
that , that , that is a crime .
i 'm always amazed at that , that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him , you know .
it 's also got a full insid , inside basketball court ,
i like the way trucks are built
but we did n't do that way .
i mean , i always thought my mom was being mean to me
and he said he was probably weaned too young , which he was , because his mom was killed ,
i think , i think i played better golf when i was fifteen , john , than --
they do n't allow people to move in , like less nations , you know ,
i 've se , i think i 've seen it around .
um , but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using
it 's a lot of cajun food and --
the oldest daughter , they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of ,
there 's too many sports people out there that , that do do these things .
we are about to hit it in ten , few minutes .
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan ,
and but actually they 're , they 're pretty good ,
but in , but in the afternoon , uh , i try to read
or ,
after , i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test .
and then , oh , there 's we have these , we have people wondering around to- , with petitions trying to get the judge ,
sometimes it can be .
and it 'll say you 've over extended your conversation , you now have fifteen minutes to compl , fifteen seconds to complete it .
and we kept that going for about a month
uh , i do n't you know , but i do n't usually .
basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care ,
and that 's right outside of ,
we 're getting up in age , i guess , in our late thirties
just , i did n't feel like she was mature enough socially --
they like to be outside as much as possible .
in minneapolis itself , because of so many people on the highway , there is becoming a problem of pollution ,
and --
but it 's just really interesting to me .
they paid fifty-eight for it .
and there 's something about their eyes .
and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake ,
and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on sundays .
on the other hand , uh , the more i learn about the history , the more i see it was incremental , uh , decisions . any one of which was sort of understandable at the time .
i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit ,
and they , you know , had done such a good job .
but they were n't great .
called her
uh , cause that 's the first i 've really known anybody that , you know , works for somebody that they had that option , you know , to make the choice --
-- and we put a flat over the top ,
i have this nasty habit of mumblex of turning my head at the last second , or ,
but , my family usually goes with me .
-- and , uh , and then they have , they raise a , they raise two sides
but it pays , uh , a substantial amount .
he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house ,
the
i do n't know if it 's , it 's got , it 's got as much notoriety
so , i got rid of them credit cards .
mumblex working a lot of hours at work
i like that .
i enjoy playing basketball and , and basically all kinds of sports .
but ,
so , um , well , i 'll tell you , my situation is , uh , i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home .
you know , it , it 's a little scary too when they 're coming up and they 're all over you .
well , she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute ,
and , and , the router , uh , helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router .
i also like jazz .
she 's more into the animated stuff , where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing
because i , i actually teach college ,
they 're mean
and , uh , plano has plans
and when they would come and change the records the guys would , the guy would give her the old records --
but now , we are trying to go back to about the sixties , when the parents , you know , when the mother was staying at home .
i guess , uh , i , it 's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing .
so , i 'm hoping , you know , that ,
what i mean how to train them so they 're going to be a blessing
he 's ,
i mean , it did n't foul one launch ,
so it 's , uh , it 's sort of home now .
but she came to our house
two , you know , two new pieces in the ref- , in the family room and new carpet .
i do n't do much with it since , uh , most of theirs ,
i 'm building our house right now
but see i do n't really like sylvester stallone .
and they we moved in when they were brand new ,
and you eat your crawfish and --
when you have a small child because they do n't want to get up at three in the morning
we 've --
i like those .
it 's getting built up , you know , with more new , new shopping centers and things . you know ,
but in terms of women ,
in fact today it 's really warm ,
you get programming , a fair amount of programming ,
i even like some , i mean , some of the original stuff ,
i came from a family of five .
and then just in general , i sleep a lot better --
well , jean , the subject is jury trials
i , i went to school and got a degree
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals .
and then there 's a card table , does n't have any chairs , just a card table . oh , some more jewelry , suitcases ,
i do n't know ,
put the safety on the gun .
so i do n't remember that
my daughter got a little bit , not much , only first year
i think it was , somebody was just scarcely just , just ripping the hell out of someo- , another person .
and we go to movies
uh , i do n't know if i 'll ever use it , you know .
i mean , we are , of course , we are americans
and he 'd already been paid by a cashing firm .
or i 've got my p c configured to where i can use either printer . the one that 's on the network or my own .
and she would have to come home at night , cut out different ,
it was really sad .
and so we just woke up
and it 's , it 's kind of nice being up here just because it 's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go .
that 's why you want to join .
i mean it is a crime ,
um , i , i also have n't thought too much about it .
i , i , i worked on some of it at t i --
and we do an awful lot of , you know ,
i tried exercise classes ,
but they do have socialized medicine and things like that .
i kind of , uh , stopped listening after a while .
and i mean , i still , unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night ,
so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind .
it really frightens me though as far as the , when you think about the , you know , thinking of just air pollution itself
and we did not have a chance to do that .
i , uh , i 'm actually working at night
well , i 'm glad to know that there 's somebody else out there that does n't get to go to the movie theater .
and , uh , this guy was going nuts ,
i have two or three , uh , apple trees ,
i do n't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you ,
i ca n't put it exactly on the lines of the jagged edge ,
they have , um , the bags behind them
lately , you know , with the new music that has come out , some of the really good , uh , music --
my , we 've just got a two car garage ,
but it does n't , there are n't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is .
first time , uh ,
but i can rem , remember back growing up , my mother ,
and ,
i 've seen them d- , the chefs on t v do that ?
and it was , uh ,
and , you know , they mark it all down
this area up here is , uh , all custom homes ,
actually they 're near plano in north dallas too ,
we decided that was it , you know ,
-- i 've heard of it .
but yet the way i was raised ,
there are , there are lots of bike paths .
uh , so i 'm kind of a novice at it .
but i could n't believe it ,
-- and i was pretty disappointed in it .
so , uh , they got along great ,
he kind of likes the casinos a little bit .
and that 's it .
and i used my mother 's recipe ,
but they 're all too busy .
i grew up outside of houston
me too .
i did n't , i do n't remember seeing that part of it .
the car designers , uh , are starting to design cars with women in mind . uh , because in the past the male bought the cars ,
uh , not that i am
i 've seen what comes out of the ocean ,
we just use trail tarps .
he says it restricts your choice of doctors , and , and so forth .
i kind of got burnt out on steven king , though .
so , uh , but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children
i , i do n't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given , you know , when i have to cash a check .
and they have the later ten game winning streak --
and that was a lot of fun .
it , it is faced with , uh , uh , enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system .
but to go out and drive , uh , never has really been , had any appeal to me --
you do n't get too much money back .
well , uh , i do n't mind it ,
and i can see it continuing on when they are adults .
well , the topic today was gardening ,
now i have never caught catfish .
they say they 're , uh , remarkably incompetent . and , uh , do n't know what they 're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to , to air , and all that .
well , we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project ,
that 's , that 's a high irritant for me .
so i --
they , they have a mandatory , they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance --
and it 's just the one ,
-- i , i like to get exercise when i 'm playing a game of some sort ,
but it 's a heavy sales tax .
i 'll let you start .
our most recent series of projects i guess , was , inside was , uh , we remodeled a bathroom recently .
and that 's the day my husband ,
i- , i- , i 'm twenty-six .
job security ,
she had crocheted a full bedspread .
and i have a niece and nephew .
well i had a weird ,
so , i 'm a little touchy every now and then about that .
-- and , and so they 've kind of changed the , the codes a little bit ,
well technically we 're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we 're on them
it did not really mean anything to me except ,
and , and they 're trying to think of what 's a troy ounce .
and so we just stay and watch that .
and the- , they had black forest cherry cake and all those things .
he loves to cook it
uh , he , he works for coca cola .
i would pick up the phone and listen to theirs .
um , also the worth of the hub of three airports
i do n't know what we 're going to be able to do about it
and like i 've even bought , on a recliner once i bought , you know , a , a , an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that ,
i will probably get a cadillac the next time quite honestly .
i worked at a still mill in this summer .
-- so it 's like completely opposed .
it does n't say part one ,
-- or i could do , uh , work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a , you know , three w- , day weekend .
and this other girl was not ,
like if i , if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours , uh , because i was going out . she would , uh , break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to , uh , to , to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did .
we play a par , a par three , nine hole course .
oh , i was going to say , you played pro ball ,
but i do n't use it anymore .
and --
they have n't gone down .
uh , oh eighteen .
i mean , uh , back a couple weeks ago they found , uh , some people i do n't remember at some fast food restaurant .
in fact this morning , i was almost late for work because i 'm almost at the end of this book
but --
because you and i , we have work schedules ,
i wanted ,
you do n't have to be a secretary ,
but one thing i did n't know is that when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars ,
i 've seen some .
that 's been real helpful too ,
uh , they 're obviously practicing sixty hours a week , you know ,
sometimes the color would take too long to plot out .
and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training .
i 'm going in for , like , interviews
when it comes on right in the dinner hour . i f , can feel like i can let them sit in front of the t v and watch ,
i was n't aware that austin was one of them ,
i 'm not sure what you 're talking about .
so and we , uh , we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home , you know , we have , we try to spend like monday nights , we call it family home evening ,
and this session is about to run out .
bu- , i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment .
i ca n't remember his name .
it seems like ,
and , so it , it fits well , in the neighborhood .
but neither one of them carried on , uh , the sports after that .
i go to the , it 's the naval postgraduate school out here .
but , uh , uh , it , it did show some , some , uh , some interesting things about the f b i
i grew up on blue grass music .
he 's out for good .
she sold it
i 'd like to see that .
see , and i do n't know , i do n't know i ca n't tell the future that 's what scares me so much about it .
uh , the budget problems up here are , are pretty tense .
in new york they have it .
well , my daughter decided to call them and check
but , um , i 'm a divorced woman .
i look at it
i keep on working .
-- um , in fairfax , virginia .
it drives me crazy .
i read to my daughter a lot , too .
because it 's , mumblex at some point it goes up to thirty-three percent
so , uh , i 'm kind of concerned about that as far as , you know , w- , the seat belts .
let me see , i think we 've only planned one family reunion in our life ,
we- , well like i said my wife normally feels that way ,
what 's interesting , several years ago , i took a course , uh , on , uh , well ,
uh , we have places where we go
there was four of us together .
they had a place ,
uh , it 's really cold
i think one was from boston .
and do n't plan on having one either , ever .
um , um , i was out there last summer ,
that 's probably , because they had , you know
and i also know that things like antihistamines , sudafeds , things like that , can really throw it off .
but that 's for my husband 's job and not mine .
i 've heard to go to austin too .
i do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not .
and those are really nice too .
i used to travel out that way a lot
but i saw a , a presentation on , on that
and then the other two nights a week my husband worked ,
i did , too .
it was a seventy mile trip everyday , you know , two ways was seventy miles .
i like that .
so , education , you know , things that relate t- , to education , um , are things that i think about a lot .
well it 's sort of the his- , the historical fiction about , uh , the salisbury area in , in england .
i 'm real happy with that one .
i 've had excellent food there .
and i think about these things and people trying to define their own world view ,
so i 've recorded quite a few movies off of that . um ,
i know it .
and i also thought that , uh , that would interfere with , with college work .
the biggest problem , well , like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools --
i , it 's real contagious
and , uh , there were two other couples with us
i mean , i 'm not big , you know , or anything ,
but , the brakes , i was really surprised that the brakes .
and i was standing there talking to my daughter
so they ca n't stop people from , uh , advertising
center for advanced study of the behavioral sciences and therefore ,
uh , oh , i can start .
it 's , uh , over , there 's one over there in addison .
i love the texas hill country .
and --
but , they 're fun .
and , now that takes the strain out , off of everyone that , uh , is driving a vehicle ,
well , i notice on one of these , uh , home shopping networks they were selling these , uh , halogen , uh , fire extinguishers --
it just really gets me depressed ,
and i do n't too often take off my coat even ,
uh , in fact , i do n't watch hardly any , uh , television at all with , uh , my other activities .
you have to be careful if you go to a , a restaurant that ,
she puts a lot of time into them .
and one of the things that , that they did for him . they tested him
and we go to florida --
and we get some , we get , uh , decent holidays .
-- when we 've taken things to the dump , just the dump , uh , that is , uh , you know , closest to us ,
when they get that highway finished , you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go --
so they have to watch out who comes in ,
that was my daughter 's brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow --
they had snacks and story time and everything .
and i 've only been there for lunch ,
it 's basically the same thing , seafood --
middlekauff ford in plano .
i do a lot of fruits --
i 've , i 've always , um , i 've talked to people who have been to africa ,
and , and then , they essentially give you the offer --
but , if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance ,
b y u .
but not quite in proportion to cost of living
and she 's talked to students , uh ,
to the top the of the peak ,
and ,
six years .
and i 'm glad they did that .
i just hate that when she does that ,
i 've been sitting here awhile .
arlington , texas .
and , and , uh , one day they 'll pick up , uh ,
i have n't read that .
you , you rarely hear , you hear , of course there 's cases where someone has been put in , in , in , uh , prison , uh , falsely accused
i do n't want them to do that , because i know a lot of people , they live right on the edge
well , the answer 's --
we , i live in yakima , washington .
i just run a printout every week
their attire is always the same , you know . suits or slacks ,
so , i always do my own income tax , you know .
and oh i , i do not know what the answer is ,
and they paid like ,
girl .
and they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat .
and i do not know if that counts .
and , of course , i look at the economic problems in the united states right now .
and you have to sit at a table and just ,
and , um , it was real odd .
and he has a chauffeur .
i , i like that .
it just opened in new york this spring ,
it takes me about four and a half hours to do , to mow our grass .
you know , we get the newspaper , and , uh --
i 'll sit down for the big games , the super bowl , and the championship --
and , um , so that many of the countries turkey and syria are the same as they were for traveling .
you listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear , by hearing the intervals and things like that .
i 'm , i 'm not sure that , um , that they 're ready to get rid of , of , uh , tom grieve yet ,
i got her when i lived in hawaii .
we 're , we 're a christian family
and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons ,
and the guy started cafe pacific .
and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years ,
i usually get some place ,
you see , i guess it depends on your landfill space .
one of the ones that you pull along --
but they 're both ,
we have two freezers ,
i sure do like the looks of that new mit- , mitsubishi diamante .
and , uh , their pastas were great .
the floors are finished with a polyurethane ,
i get off on strange little details of food , i guess .
they 're still going to be subs and things .
now see for me , that 's a long ways .
what i have always identified is i am basically good with money .
and i , uh , personally , i do n't approve of it for two reasons .
i mean --
although this was a computer company , he had his , uh , p h d in musical , uh , i guess it was in composition , actually , from university of north texas ,
i do n't , oh ,
she , um , she had somehow gotten the information from t i --
and this thing came on where these , a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and , and robbing --
well , i 've done some rewiring on it .
and you can just get as much power as you need up there .
i mean they thought that it was terrible , you know ,
and then during the summertime it 's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors ,
but , uh , i guess if i , uh , length of , length of time i 'm in the state now , is what , after you 're here twenty years you 're considered native .
so they had to wait , uh , you know , in , uh , certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over .
and , uh , you know , every time something new came up , i was explaining it to them .
and , uh ,
-- or , or , you know , it 's one of these situations where nobody 's going to restrain what you eat ,
a gentleman , uh , that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned , well , appealed again .
-- it 's just north of me here .
they feel like , uh , you know , they 're taking some of the , the rewards that they should have .
i do n't .
you know , of course , they have all the little video games and , you know , those little quarter rides , you know , to , and stuff like that
and i 'm going ,
and , uh , and what you saw is was what you got .
but i think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that .
i think another house could fit back there .
so i guess i 've lost them .
whenever you say bright steps , everybody goes , oh , i 've heard that 's the best day care in town , you know ,
i think they 're in for a odd year this year ,
well there 's a , there 's a holiday spa down there on , on k street , i think . something like that .
the guy 's gouging , gouging your eyes out ,
and the air conditioning went out on the car ,
i 'm a speech therapy major --
i do n't hit a driver off the tee .
uh , i have n't really seen one since probably august because , uh , every weekend in , in the fall we go to our high school football game on friday --
how they do things
and then , the nurses and doctors really did n't put any for , forth any loving care for them .
and i like them because they 're kind of short and to the subject .
that 's why i thought , well , you know , this is the time .
he went to vietnam one man and came back another , not better .
and he said , whoops ,
i live in richardson --
and um , well , it 's got a lot , i mean , pages and pages .
i hate to quo , that movie born on the fourth of july ,
i 've noticed that too ,
and when i take care of some people 's kids ,
and i 'm trying to stay home as long as i can ,
i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there .
and we do n't know .
i , i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself .
i , i , i would hope it would , uh ,
i wonder what it would be like ,
our house is n't the average small one .
i can see it being done , uh , on a regular schedule .
but most of them are gone now --
but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys do n't make it seven years , you know .
so i guess i 'm kind of in debt , i , i suppose , because i do n't , you know , been paying taxes all that , all that long .
and it was twenty- six degrees out .
we like to get out and walk ,
i , i was trying to remember , there was a court case , uh , here where i live , just a few months ago .
and , uh , they had to learn all about each other basically --
that is about the last time i have been through marlin and mart .
that is when she did , i think .
we 're big broccoli fans .
and , uh , and i thought no , you know , because i would n't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight .
but all of a sudden it just was n't working ,
and she 's just wondering well --
and ,
whoever 's mom and dad it is , you usually go and stay with them ,
it 's only like the work 's only , you know , three weeks .
i know for a fact that the , any kind of stuff that if you , wrote and asked for material ,
after eleven years of marriage . yeah , we are .
oh , well , my sister 's living in illinois right now ,
like central time or mountain time they , they push things back .
now that 's it 's all over with , you know .
and i , i think it is important that i see what they are watching .
but at t i they , before they had the testing , i 've forgotten , seems like it 's a year ago september , something like that , they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government .
and they thought that , you know , at certain points that it was going to end ,
well , december seventy-two , was when we bombed north vietnam , and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three ,
we really did n't plant anything .
i know that one day , uh , my youngsters were watching the three stooges ,
it 's , it 's university of vermont .
when they get to be teenagers with long legs , it may not work .
i mean , we do n't have the right to pay taxes in this country ,
and we went to this one ,
well then , uh , see , uh , that 's , that 's one of the points which i do n't see ,
my , my favorite movie of all time has been , uh , uh , the mission .
and that was my , that was my last experience .
that pretty much covers my experiences .
and i think it 's good that they 're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools .
some of the punk , um , when i was in high school , that was , uh , one of the big things , was punk music ,
we normally , yeah ,
they pop up pretty fast .
then , uh , i read the , the newspaper at home generally in the evening .
and it 's just an old , old compact , that is super slow
when we travel we look for wendy 's because we have kids ,
and you know they do ted kennedy .
well two , two of them actually .
they 've got trees ,
and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe .
really it was just
we 've got , we 've got all the different lake editions around the house
or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins
it 's called intellect
and they ca n't believe that they could survive it .
and he was right ,
and so i , i 've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that .
-- and i 'm pretty happy with it so far .
so , i mean i remember , uh , right around then that 's when i first started hearing about vietnam .
so i like that .
and my daughter is just nine months old --
-- so we basically had one of the parks .
and --
she just had her fourth one in , uh , march
there 's , um , a thing called pfeiffer rim .
so , and , and you withhold no matter what you do ,
just like v c r 's , too .
and , i have , i mean i 've seen some change ,
well , i was just talking about any company .
she , she did very well in school
-- and you zip through it quicker .
i mean , i ca n't , i , i , again , i ca n't make any predictions about them ,
so i had to pick ryan up , you know ,
at the same time , it had a story line about people trying to find themselves .
-- and so , i like to cut out my wood , and then tole paint on the items that i cut out .
they take up so much space that you do n't have any place then to work .
and , uh , during the summer we would camp out at the lake .
-- w- , all we do here is make transformers --
and so i 'm sort of out of business .
in oklahoma , it 's the men 's garden clubs that i would have wanted to join .
well i always think i 'm paying too much taxes .
he says it 'll probably be gone in a done ,
but i 'd like to stay at home with them until they get in , at least into kindergarten ,
and if you do you get them once a week or something , you know .
it 's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that .
so i 'm kind of hoping ,
we got him a little pole last year ,
i go with good intentions ,
it 's , it 's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan , though .
look at the twins going from worst to first .
but , you know , i like , i just like getting out , being in the outdoors ,
it was n't part of what i knew ,
so , i --
but , uh , it , uh , definitely responds to , uh , to authority
fuel economy is n't great , being a mini van ,
they know i do n't like it .
i , i would hate to be in a position where that was all i could afford
that 's , see that 's what we did in girl scouts
and i should calculate it better .
my fiance is selling , uh , a nineteen seventy-eight cutlass supreme that she has .
like i 'm from pennsylvania ,
and , my parents still do .
i 've had this for a couple weeks
mumblex is pretty close to new orleans
i love chinese .
but if i was to buy one , probably something like a miata .
they rebuilt it
and i , i was so relieved because i 've been making a real concerted effort , make , you know , recycling the aluminum and --
-- but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may .
the competition is , are teams that they 've already beat this year ,
we have blueberries , blackberries .
and we 've been here years when it 's been hundreds
but i park for free up at , at memorial stadium because i know where i can do it for free .
and one is , uh , four .
well , it 's been a long time since we 've been in there
we 're the only country in the world that does .
i do not know what they are called .
-- and those are really neat
well , they are .
even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything .
so , i think , um , people think it 's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would ,
none of them have cars because they ca n't drive .
i , i like that .
the bottom fell out .
-- so , it , uh , has worked out quite well ,
i grew up
but , uh , my stuff re , uh , revolv , revolves around , uh , one hun- , one thou- , let 's see ,
um , i do n't have any , i guess , definite views about elderly care .
-- two little deals ,
i , i have n't been there ,
and it 's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as , uh , you know , hurting someone , i mean ,
i really ca n't get into that
a little town called tuckaho , over by white plains .
and i could --
well , i like to use this , this sears , uh , the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee .
if i do n't like it , i 'll go someplace else , do something different .
i mean , i 've seen like picture of them
even , despite , you know , diligent washing , it , it got rusty after about , uh , three weeks of use .
and , uh , we went in
i have n't ,
mumblex he made the decision , uh , i 'd say , about , uh , an hour and a half ago .
it was a wood shingle roof ,
but they have nice personalities
i mean , i 've done some of both .
i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered
okay , i could see that that might be the situation where , uh , the person could be rehabilitated .
-- i , i have n't had to plant any trees because i 've got so many ,
mile a minute .
we had one of those two days ago .
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars .
but it 's , i really think it 's true for our family ,
well , they got in a bind and says we do n't want to , you know , play any more --
that they retired to ,
in , in other words , i am fa , in favor of drug contro- , or , or , or drug testing .
but , but every team that 's , that 's really good seems ,
well , that 's what i 'm paying on mine now .
i used to use it quite a bit .
i mean it 's just , because i 'm in the humanities it 's just ,
and , you know , they , because they 're , you know , like public , they 're not private --
but i do n't envy anybody who 's in that situation to find day care .
and , it 's kind of nice because i 've made money at it , too .
like if you 're stealing something or doing anything like that .
i lived in the country for several years ,
but , um , what i do do , and i 've always done it is ,
and , and i do n't give that out .
and she is charging out of her mind already .
and now it 's not in the mountain valleys .
but --
but , but regard to benefits . you know , most companies have , most big organizations have decent , you know , benefits like retirement and that sort of thing .
uh , uh , at least --
i thought carter was good too ,
-- and so we would do a lot of fishing there too
he likes to do that --
so , i do more work kind of related reading than , uh , just for enjoyment .
i 'll be right back .
i find a lot of the cookbooks that , i do n't know , that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients , or things i do n't keep on hand all the time --
in the , in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan , um , wallpaper --
it goes back and forth .
we did those ourselves
i , you know , i was going into the grocery store ,
so i began a program couple , i do n't know probably three or four weeks ago
well , really , this is , breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors , i mean ,
and knock wood that , uh , they have not ,
and we do n't know who 's handling them now --
-- and , uh , it 's hot down here
uh ,
it 's for cooper industries .
now , i work at j c penny at their corporate headquarters .
but , i mean , i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city --
and the , the recycling at georgia tech , like that , uh , outside the , uh , student center --
completely .
we 're , uh , we 're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff ,
i had plenty of snow to last me forever .
but , you know , the weather 's trying to turn now
so many times , i mean , you had the , uh , the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time .
it 's , richardson
if you let them cook too long --
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work
but , uh , not to say i would n't ,
it 's opening next year .
this is the kid who , who really , you know , barely --
uh , the female 's red
-- and , and they just do n't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments .
it 's coach pitch , until you get nine --
and he just , you know , wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print
she must spend more on one application of body lotion than i do on soap for an entire year .
now , there 's some ,
but then i have to wait for my ,
we 're planning a trip , just he and i .
it 's like a little bit past campbell and plano road .
and he has , he has some like different programs out ,
and i do n't know ,
it 's up state
i have n't seen a whole lot either ,
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of , a lot of , uh , building magazines and , and , and plant engineering magazines and , read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines
we had s- , a few showers , but , uh , nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke .
well arsenio hall is the one that jumped up and said that i ca n't believe they killed them
well , we , we eat out a good deal at this point .
and it 's up in the closet ,
so i have always instilled into her ,
so , you know , it was prime time ,
but , i pretty much , uh , worked on my own routine .
but in a sense , i do n't know that i would say it 's good ,
and , another thing i 've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes
we belong to a country club a little ways outside of dallas ,
they 're located --
number one , i really feel that that 's my private , you know , my own home .
i have more or less , i have my favorite shows
i did n't , um , i did n't buy the , uh , i did n't buy a kit .
you know , pick it up .
i have .
and , uh , we have been ,
for about four weeks .
and then the cat , uh , died .
so , uh , the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually .
and i 'd always loved working with children .
i have sold quite a bit .
but , um , that was a great big thing ,
and , um , the , the , uh , different slant .
but i really would hope that they would come up .
i read , uh , dave dreveki 's book --
but , you know , i would , i 'm , i 'm in favor of , of that type of thing .
i 've done that for college football .
but , i know from his childhood , he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment , i guess .
i was thinking of the one recipe that , uh , that we made .
i lived actually in lebanon ,
and , uh , they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom .
and , uh , so then when i , you know , i finally get a chance to go out with my husband it 's like a real chore to find something nice to wear .
it was just , you know , it was just plain , a plain , uh , ro , you know , round , uh , necked , uh , sw- , sweater .
but since i 've started back into school now , i have n't really done that much .
and we were getting ready to leave
i used to read time magazine a lot ,
i am fairly knowledgeable of mumblex .
-- my husband does all that stuff .
and i tune in to c n n a lot .
they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property ,
i just file federal income tax every year .
i 've been in my own business , mary kay , in fact ,
if the road is at all wet , and i 'm ,
when they start needing something , you know , then that will be different
i mean , you ca n't get the down to any size , you know .
uh , that 's an old established , uh , restaurant .
uh , i got in some problems with , uh , financial problems because of credit cards
and it has nothing .
he 's ,
so i , i 've kind of , uh , rationalized that it 's , it 's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see .
because i did n't hear them say that ,
the only thing i did n't like was in some of the more touristy areas --
and , uh , even , uh , i did not , uh , use my math , uh , in my work ,
i do too .
well , we , uh , we really like the mexican food , you know , here in texas --
i mean , you know , this is the rules that they can do this anytime .
you said that perhaps , uh , people have given up the thought that rehabilitation 's possible
i work part time at night --
uh , i know in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required .
know if you do n't ,
right now i 'm self employed
so , uh , i 've read a lot of information , knowing that to be true ,
one of the fellows got mixed up in a riot that was going on down there ,
but then i 'll get tired of doing that ,
i 've just today ordered a fax modem
and there it 's , uh , if i remember right , you well , they , they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and , or hours per pay period or something ,
it was quite chilly
she 's like openly told people .
but , uh , that 's about it there .
right now we 're looking for housing , uh , somewhere down in the duncanville and cedar hill area .
and ,
we used to go fishing in lake texoma .
so we use it quite a bit --
-- and i was just sitting there going , oh , my goodness ,
i think it was , about the need for women to work .
we --
but she talked about that and how the , the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together , and , um , you know , about the bread and the ritual placement .
now since i got somebody from arlington , virginia one day .
he 's got on i b m .
our oldest grandson , when he was eighteen months old went into a , a montessori ,
you know , if i 'd have been asleep for five years ,
tha , everybody that goes in there smokes
i have a friend who works for t i
we do .
things to hang on the wall .
uh , so i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i do n't know very much about puerto rico .
and it was gone .
it 's just me ,
i mean , when you have a man that 's signed a , a , a statement saying he 's guilty ,
uh , now color preferences ,
there 's a few things where they have to say yes or no , like abortion or gun control ,
i , i , i guess the , the best thing i like to see from the sixties and seventies is , of course , is the mini skirt , of course .
they 're going to school , getting degrees , making all this money ,
uh , last year when they passed the tax laws for the , uh , nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one --
see , i think that 's what 's my biggest problem with going to a place , uh , a , a health club .
my husband also , we 're involved in everything our kids does --
and also , if you , if someone did happen to steal your credit card , my husband was saying that if , you know , you notice it within , i think it 's twenty-four hours , you can report it in ,
that 's the one .
that , that 's , that 's new to me .
i do n't know if it 's been a deterrent or not , because we have , uh , just started using it --
and it , the bird got away from him one afternoon ,
oh , i did n't know that .
so --
but everybody mumblex wants to do it
uh , because , i would think , i think , you know , mentally , uh , and emotionally , i think women can handle a job and ,
he , he 's living now up , uh , in , in maryland
-- and , and we 're a long way away ,
and i saw , there were some stop signs , i mean , submerged up to the writing on the stop sign ,
and i had never even thought of it .
and we 'd look for about what you 're looking for .
and she 's going to buy her house ,
in the past we 've had homes that have n't had any side walks ,
i would n't imagine that a barbecued chicken would .
and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the , the recreation center and do it helps a lot .
and , uh , we 've had two schnauzers
cypress cr- , creek springs .
we 're not supposed to talk about that .
and then when the bill actually comes in , i go ahead and fill in the actual amount .
my father likes , uh , country western music .
we just get right on the freeway and just go north .
-- these people were like paralyzed ,
and i was able to , you know , get , his schedule just , uh , cooperated .
i do n't know if those are still available or not ,
i belong to a biking club here in kenosha .
and , uh , the band i play in , we tend to rehearse quite a bit on sundays .
i 'm in the speech processing business ,
i do n't know what the answer is .
i do n't happen to have one at home . um ,
and the schools down there , from what i know , are not bad .
but he 's always come back eventually
i live in one ,
i 've seen that done , where there 's uh , oh ,
and just recently i 've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing .
i 'm not sure that they would admit it at that age , that it was boys ,
that 's what our two rooms are on the front , too , with these long windows .
it is in the urban areas ,
and they 're sharp
nobody would want me on their team .
it sure does .
cocoa did n't think too much of it , though .
it gives it a little tang .
uh , the pro- , problem that i found , um , in this area is that the , there , there is inconsistency in the quality --
we 've talked about planning a trip up through , um ,
and that 's where we stopped .
and , and , uh ,
i , i , i grew up in , uh , sixties and early seventies
and three sold the summer before ,
richardson area .
if you can ,
even at that , i have a son , that , who 's only nine at the moment .
i , i , ca n't wait for them to get it started .
i have n't done any painting since i was a child
and , you know , we , we filled it back up --
and i can pick it out again because it 's not typical ,
it really did n't relate to me .
uh , when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do , take care of themselves physically . uh ,
you know , and he said , you know , i can balance my checkbook in seconds , you know --
. we bought one car that way
and you know i am constantly making car payments ,
i do n't have one
that one kid that becca likes --
the , uh , the movie , the doors , has so- , some nice desert scenes ,
the um th- the uh christian uh point
and then , uh , we do n't have a lot ex , extra for extra spending ,
but that 's , that 's one of the things i do n't , do n't understand is , is so much of the controversy
and i could n't wait to have them it would be kind of silly , you know , to go back to work as soon as i had them ,
and his name is dominique .
and we had the same thing up there continuously salting the roads for snow .
and some of it , sometimes it 's serious
but , you know , i 'd like to make sure that i have a job tomorrow first .
and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i 've heard , that everything would be in , in , you know , a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up .
but i 'm like you ,
for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage , uh ,
uh , it 's , uh miniature .
um , i thought an excellent one , too , was misery with kathy bates and james caan .
they would go jog , they would go with me when i would go running
i think she made three this year one for , uh , my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters .
my v c r went on the blitz about two weeks ago ,
my wife hates it ,
i mean i do n't even have to pay .
but i do n't have a problem with weight .
sort of an interesting topic since i just got back from lunch here .
well , i never did ,
and i do n't know what the solution is .
and so , uh , i was very much interested , uh , in getting involved in , uh , switchboard .
so i just , like sometimes ,
and i was looking at the , uh ,
i mean i could n't even go there .
and she was so happy to get the information , you know .
well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom , i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone 's guilty or innocent .
and i 'm in plano .
and i sit and watch for a few minutes
and , because it 's a wool skirt
and i said , that 's wonderful .
i , i do get somewhat of a kick out of ,
i forget .
and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
but when they sell juice , it 's some strange quirk in the law , you do n't have to have a deposit on it .
oh , very suspenseful .
but , uh , since i 've become a parent and since i 've seen , uh , things like jeffrey dahlmer , i really have to question that .
and that aggravates me .
-- and in reality in many cases , they knew , or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations .
but they 're doing a lot of research here , uh , the e p a .
and i , i love it .
but i , i have n't .
we just rented , um , a couple weeks ago , a movie called the freshman ,
and my husband says that 's called rinky-dink .
so , when we 're invited to people 's house , he will not smoke in their house . which i think is good because there 's a lot of people that are very ,
so they found a , a place nearby that they put her in last year .
um , a lot of places that even do n't look , do n't look like much .
and we learn to do the , uh , transfer pictures on the sweatshirts --
but she 's accepted it real well now --
and i am pushing towards that .
and then she went over to nairobi and took a safari around --
and , uh , we visit mexico occasionally ,
and th- , they , it just really ,
about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans .
and , uh , they 've had some financial problems with the team and so forth .
but i would have to get them picked up from there --
and we knew time wise , or , and money wise , too --
and sure enough , boy the fur just came off like crazy once i got them --
i 've been there before
we do n't collect any of that
i do n't like the new style , like of the toyota van ,
i 'm in lubbock , texas .
and they wanted to watch ,
that 's what the utah and the large family .
i mean , i do n't , you know , i do n't , i know my wife , uh ,
we , well , --
because he said , i can make a lot of money just singing alone ,
for a long time whe , when i was very young she did n't drive .
so , we really have n't , we do n't have a good organized system , yet .
i do not ,
why , i do n't know ,
i , i , i personally work with someone that , that is deaf , and can not speak .
and some , a lot of times they 'll give us something .
always .
and i do not envy these mothers --
and , uh , you know , two counts of kidnapping , uh --
and then on leaf weekends it was , which is this time of the year , it 's bumper to bumper traffic ,
i do n't know whether the idea is to be within the country , or outside the country .
especial- , we got two kids that are --
i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home ,
they 're , they 're lean-tos .
and it 's private
and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab .
i 'll , i 'll make a little sort of greenhouse , a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in .
and so we 're going to use people that we 're in a relationship with that we know , that , you know , we know are people of integrity .
it 's very deceiving , you know , 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go , uh , i do n't like want that ,
or we 're going to buy a van .
and we just never watched any of them ,
and i do n't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico .
but this past time i did n't .
and a lot of parents have places to go and --
b- , and i pay five dollars every time i visit the , the hospital --
i , i feel bad when i see the inefficiency , even here at t i , you know ,
and , and , and at least one person who 's in my field started off as an engineer , started off as an elec , elec , an electrical engineer student , and then switched over at some point into language processing , because he found that he enjoyed it more .
that day , uh , i was saying now he , he 's sick .
so , we 're just starting into hunting for child care .
we were watching roseanne , i guess , couple of weeks ago ,
um , that was a concern with me .
kuwait wants to take iraq out of the whole system ,
it was actually wonderful because where i was they were half met fans and , um , half sox fans .
and , uh , in south dakota , the minnesota twins are the closest professional sports team to where i was living --
where it 's multiple , you know .
but she , we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that .
i wa , used to watch oprah a lot in the afternoons ,
and i will , uh , check off what checks have cleared
i guess , uh , there 's some , uh , things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly .
and i think , well , what if somebody 's dumped something back there in the , and no one knows about it and , you know , it sinked in through the ground and all that ,
she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy
and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it , see .
uh , in dallas , some of the major problems , uh ,
i work around , you know a lot of teachers
and we watched it this summer for two to three months ,
now my sister is a , a sun fiend .
-- and , um , i do n't like them as well except , it was n't really a fair comparison because those were automatics ,
margaret truman daniels writes a lot those .
as long as it 's random , and , and the individual 's rights are , uh , are protected , i do n't have that big a problem with it .
and it 's real easy to do ,
i have enjoyed aerobics in the past ,
when i , when i started thinking about this , that those are some of my favorite shows , mcgyver , because it 's , it 's only one person there , more than , uh , you know , instead of a cast --
you know , what for him to finish me off .
but , i do enjoy ,
and that was we bought a station wagon .
in plano .
but he 's a very tame spoiled house cat , you know , now that i 've had him for seven years .
right down the street .
already cut back .
uh , we are , uh , going to be traveling to europe with a choral .
i hate to see that ,
you 've got to prepare it well
so , it was kind of like , she had her babies and understood about , you know ,
so , so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work --
and i , i especially like baking and making deserts .
he really likes shenandoah .
and , uh , so , you know , it helped him and , and the first one , uh , he went to a , uh , church preschool --
i worked for the , uh , smith douglas division of borden chemical
um , they started with newspapers and , uh , of course aluminum cans , and --
i mean , my husband and i ,
i know what you mean .
i said , you got two choices kid ,
mumblex it did n't , it , it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans .
now , by the end he was looking more like a cop .
and i 've worked , worked in fast food restaurants .
and you do n't want them up that early .
that 's --
or it does n't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor ,
they get , uh , just one bloom on the plant .
but i 'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that i can .
um , i think my favorite show is hunter .
well , i think we 've used up as much time as we 're supposed to anyway .
they 're making them neon colors .
you know , we just kind of dump things in each one , if , you know ,
it 's a good movie .
i , i tell you , it 's difficult in that guy 's position coming into that because there , he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things , you know .
uh , whether they , they decide whether or not they , uh , the accused or whatever would get the , uh , get the death penalty .
i am trying to get my little boy into reading , uh , like church books and things .
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick
i mean , you know , they lay me off ,
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single , um , you know , bad ruler or something , you can have a tyranny of the majority .
if my parents were to get ill , i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help .
m- , my mother-in-law 's a real fan of hers .
they 're , they 're , they 're real balanced out .
i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem , is , is the financial end .
i really would .
we really do n't get into small little purchases .
so , you kind of learn something as well as en , enjoy yourself .
and then ,
and the very last chapter , and i have n't figured out why that one was last , is how to manage engineers .
so that 's the number one thing we do , whether we fertilize or anything else , just because we got burned so badly before .
that 's sort of the same thing that , that i do .
i do n't , i do n't either . uh , to make it totally honest .
she never did .
that 's all i do , too .
so they were in a shot to make the play-offs
see , i did n't even think to look for that .
we 're still on a well water ,
and --
i 'm still trying to find my way around .
and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big , for somehow big is perceived as the better .
you know , i 've got two kids to put clothes on ,
i 've , uh ,
and our truck was back .
i do n't think he could ever redeem himself ,
now they do n't understand that , you know , maybe he needed fifty dollars
well , for example , we had spring break now ,
i mean it 's not very many miles from our house at all .
and no matter what the weather is they can walk --
and now we 're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that .
and i 'll do my little community service throughout , but never --
if they 're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out
being from california and wanting to hear like
and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorl- , favorably , because they 're going to do it .
you almost have to relearn every spring to , to get back out .
so --
but they 're dead .
and i feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things .
he 'd been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all .
so , uh , our insurance paid for everything ,
i wanted to go to that course ,
so i 'll tell them that
um , usually , uh , word processing something , um , such as , oh , forms for things , uh ,
i understand the topic this morning is , uh , our policy in latin america and , you know , what we 've been doing down there .
oh , cornell is in ithaca .
i have a credit union .
and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake , uh , on lake erie .
and they never mentioned that problem .
like the customer is always right
i ,
it 's right outside of dallas .
-- and you can actually get a good wo- ,
and she lives in western north carolina
i 'm living in the t w u dorm across from collier , uh ,
they went to work
and some of still has to be redone .
uh , it 's a paperback
but certainly i ca n't understand not calling the police .
and , uh , i thought , i think that 's really interesting .
but , uh , i do n't know i think it 's , i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it 's a , it 's a really old bush ,
and you might be teachable ,
and we have enough clouds that , uh , there are other areas that would be better suited .
and i 'm , uh , a backsliding presbyterian --
it is .
it does n't fit in their little containers
so i 've been ,
uh , see , i 'm not a big julie roberts fan .
and i think that 's really good because they 're learning to like all different kinds
and they did for a long time . i could n't ,
i come from a family of golfers .
i 've known jack for a long time ,
it 's not too bad .
i guess , in nine- , the early seventies .
i tape thirty something ,
but you kn , you know what 's really funny is that they , there 's been some research , because i 'm a ,
i can do enough damage with those two .
like if he puts in a dollar they 'll put in a dollar , you know .
uh , disneyland , i mean there 's still a lot of people at disneyland ,
it was just too far away ,
it was real close to where i worked .
and the people i 'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life .
the starters are kind of fragile .
and it started pouring down rain .
and they worked
i am married to a wonderful man ,
maybe , maybe sometimes i 've gotten twenty-two .
a little sesame street one --
it was a expen- ,
and i , i thought it was a mistake
well , i am quite a bit older than you are .
and when we retire we 're going to buy us , a , you know , a new one and , and get rid of the two that we have right now .
she had injured her back and needed a walking partner
i love that guy .
but i do n't know if that affects outside .
but , uh , i do n't know if that 's been challenged in the courts or not .
this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds --
but i was out of the country at the time ,
they do it to prisoners --
i have through ,
i , uh , i would certainly like to see a real test of , of making drugs real cheap --
-- and you know , there 's a big move , especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c -s --
and , uh , my , my cousins have a , you know , they put on a family reunion , um , once a year ,
because i , i descend from that .
but then when it started , i just could n't , you know , read .
or we play games , like board games .
so , so they turned it around ,
even , uh , we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting ,
it will be .
and , uh , we were going over to my mother 's house for christmas , you know , to have a meal .
-- and we have cable ,
oh , it 's just amazing .
although i did n't see very many indian people in there .
and , you know , it 's so frustrating ,
but i 'll ,
it 's free inside the company ,
i thought it was a pretty good show .
and usually when i am through with one , i will go in and , uh , uh , uh , look , look through , uh ,
and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere .
he had to redo that too .
i mean it , it was really exciting ,
i do n't .
some of them i had already practiced .
well , it has n't been a long time mumblex t i
but on the other hand ,
she says , look at that person he 's driving and reading at the same time .
my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born --
like i 've , i 've looked into riding the bus to work
and i always check them off and , you know , check my balance and my book and , you know , because i always want to know exactly what i have , you know .
well , i , i , sincerely hope that you do n't have that terrible storm we had .
it 's a mud dog .
they 'll get into it .
he said , you 're going to get a car that 's got flood damage or hail damage .
and it 's been great ,
and i had called back to the house .
um , what i , what i 'm trying to do is i 've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms --
and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little ,
and it has just been the most relaxing , enjoyable , self-satisfying thing i 've had .
you know , if i could fine ,
he 's getting his doctorate in industrial ,
and i , i vote as often on absentee as i can because it 's so easy now .
really , it 's , it 's fairly clean , um ,
and we had to acquit him in both cases .
but i have had that discussion before as well .
they look totally different ,
um ,
and , uh , --
so i get a pretty good little drive --
and i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up .
i 'm just going to have to put it ,
it , it 's just so smooth
-- and other major countries are higher .
just um the crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own
and we 're renting ,
my husband has just gotten stuck .
it 's just absolutely incredible .
oh , i hope they come ,
and then he 's got me into making eggs without the yolk .
and we bought lots of equipment from her , supplies
and i have my house ,
but just a few months ago when he was my husband , uh , his father gave us this car
well i 've got two .
now if they do n't ,
it 's gotten up to , uh , ninety a couple of times .
my kids get the biggest kick out of that .
see , i 've only been to texas once .
but that 's kind of like an insurance thing .
and the thing is , i hardly have room now for all the things that we 're saving it to recycle ,
oh , it was excellent .
uh , you know , i mean it was ready for the graveyard .
but the service academies have all , all the faculty , uh , for the most part is , is military with a few exchange ,
well , they , they give an , uh , an english translation on a , on a screen up above the stage .
and you separate your glass and paper --
well , i 'm , i 'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car .
my , uh , grandmother , um , made us a couple of quilts for the baby ,
and so we even , we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok .
and a lot of my sewing i kind of do out of necessity , you know ,
i 'm just north of addison airport --
i need to , uh , either paper back over it or do something .
but there 's so many occasions when i 've had to move some members of the family or do this or that ,
but in order to get in , you have to be able to , um , walk in on your own ,
-- we 're eastern .
today 's his birthday .
so , when we 're here at home , you know , with sweets and stuff , they , they do n't , we do n't really do that much .
and i 'm , you know , showing them if you 're strong in math and science , kiddos , this is one area where women can make some decent money .
hundred percent cotton .
we miss --
in fact , uh , we even , we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that ,
and that 's probably not typical america
i 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that 's dropping .
and then he was gaining weight again , was just getting healthy ,
i 'm not actually . uh ,
and she 's got four kids .
and we drove into san juan to catch our plane .
but i was bored part of the time , too .
i think , i think the social changes in them , i think i see it more with that generation --
and it 's nice for me because , um , most of the time you have so , so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week ,
we like pay her for six weeks at a time --
familiar with it than ,
-- you have something to take it out .
but i do n't know at what point ,
i , actually , i like the anti-lock brakes .
and she even told me that .
-- but , i 've never been there for dinner .
and ,
so i know there is the possibility that --
and he 's , he 's working to pay those off .
and my job was mostly the woodwork .
so i get all the same treatment again .
oh , you got mumblex more experience than i do then on it .
you know , straight across .
another movie i watched .
i think w- , i think we 're going to talk about parents spending time with their children .
they expect , opening it for one hour ,
well but , still i know that this one was built for two ninety nine , which is nowhere near what we paid for it .
and that will make another hazardous dump --
i was just being curious .
and that was something we were looking for , um ,
i do n't think of , um , trailers and campers and all this stuff .
and so one thing that i 'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits
and he just goes to the dallas one .
we do n't , we do n't do enough .
but i was reading classical works that i had n't read before .
and i 've never been above , like , you know , one-hundred and fifty ,
i 'm going crazy ,
my wife had , uh , just put in a bunch of , i want to say , they are pansies .
but he 's never made an american film .
i work until six --
and i mean it 's nothing fancy , you know ,
i , i do n't particular like the fact that it 's the military , you know ,
but i 've been following spring training
he has his in the kitchen ,
but we went out there afterwards
i wo n't make , i wo n't have a sharp cheddar because it , for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp ,
uh , i ca n't think of the name of the one that has the , uh , military , uh , fellow .
-- and i have adult tastes now ,
i know .
but we would n't lose our pis- , our , uh , shotgun .
like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested .
but , uh , unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that , red cross , it was so many of them in it , that at any particular chance , your chance of having to do something was , it was very slim .
i , i , i 'm really , i 'm really concerned about , you know ,
um , we moved from colorado where ,
and that really made a bad impression on me .
i like to cook , um , heavy sauces , and , um ,
um , something that i , i think that i 've noticed that
and , you know , he qualified for , for the help ,
and he was , he was just too big .
i worked up there last summer ,
so they are all pretty well grown up
it took me quite a while to pay them off ,
but , you know , when it gets right down to it ,
-- my husband works in salt lake ,
and , um , we go on a , like fifty to a hundred miles every sunday .
so they stayed six months ,
and , they have quite a few rooms , and , uh , so we , we will usually rent one for about a week or so .
and she could go to sleep at two in the morning --
some people like swiss , um ,
well i am a working mother .
and i saw these little springer spaniels --
they have a huge yard and a huge house ,
and it 's , uh , especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave
we 've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it , uh , as anyone , you know .
and we had , we did lasagna and garlic bread and , uh , yummy .
this is totally accidental that i have to talk about this topic .
and then they have like , you know , the real velvety looking stuff inside --
and i think it 's been probably about five and a half minutes or something .
and so , i , i camped a lot in , um , the middle east --
we 're going to be teaching him what we can at home , of course ,
-- and the other one is night court .
and in kansas also , uh , they , they almost immediately put back capital punishment
a small town .
i 'm a graduate student ,
-- and we 're leasing a , uh , two story town home in a section of dallas they call north dallas .
but that does n't mean it gets done .
i mean , i think i paid just as much as when --
-- and to try and , uh , try and find time it 's hard , uh , with jim 's schedule , too , just to get a time that we can both go .
last year it was the end of july
i really had no idea .
i 'd like to have a sports car too ,
and we have cookouts on sunday uh ,
so ,
i was mad because those were mine mumblex ,
i , i 'm teaching in the daytime --
that 's about as far as we go .
so i assume that probably the total cove- , cost is probably ,
uh , he 's a pomeranian and sheltie cross .
it would n't be a used , used car ,
i mean i can just get so ,
and you could say , oh , that 's a good program for them because it 's educational
i mean , i have , you know , i have everything he 's ever well , almost everything he 's ever done .
and , i 'm , i , i 'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out .
maybe not , maybe they 're not really concerned about getting paid
uh , uh , they 've , uh , looked at , uh , plutonium and uranium and , uh , some other similar things to --
i mean , i have been to new york .
in texas i noticed since i 've been here , in twelve years that they , they break up the , the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial .
i 've never done that one before .
i know .
i like to , i like to do it
but , uh , to make a good living , there really , around here , there just is n't too much .
uh , i do n't really want to ,
i do n't ,
that way that , you know , one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time .
um , actually i listen to ,
i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift .
and both of them were on playoff teams , uh ,
and i did n't , could n't realize if it was the husband or the father or what ,
but we did that for e- , from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until , uh , our older son went away to college .
but it 's , it 's over on the other end .
i 'll be twenty-two next month .
so he has to dress ,
well that 's about it really .
our yard does n't have a sprinkler system , but the island does
and it 's , it 's a factory environment .
it 's pressed .
if i have a problem discipline , you know , i think ,
actually , december was my first month away from them .
but , i did n't think that was as good . because ,
well , if i had your address , i would send you ,
it 's , it 's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap .
you know , amateurs but really quite good .
but i did n't get elected on the panel ,
red meat and a potato .
because i , in general , like a smaller rather than a larger population ,
it , uh , it was , uh , it was a , a smart move to make .
i know a few people ,
and then we had , uh , german shepherds at the time ,
but , um , you know , i just keep looking at ,
mumblex it , uh , it would be nice if we did n't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings
and it 'll start stacking up .
but , uh , next morning , she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom .
and i went down there a couple , maybe three weeks ago for a trial ,
i do not have a real big front yard .
and then the spackling had to dry a day
but maybe that riding place that is north of town that she goes to .
but , uh , on the other hand , i , i , uh , i enjoy having the , the time --
i am kind of , uh , uh , i 'm pretty bad about procrastinating --
and , uh , we 'll get out of the driving range and , and get some interest built up
-- he took one for , for , uh , wal-mart --
because no matter what i did or how i did it , i invariably got myself wet .
and the library will take glass .
so we 're going to talk about , uh , what kind of clothes we wear while we work .
but , you know , part of my feeling is that if you solve , help them to work through their problems while they 're littler , then they wo n't have as many problems up there .
the , the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it .
it is ,
and we have been married ten plus years
and then we buy , like , cooking equipment and stuff .
i do a little bit of woodworking ,
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement .
and none of them even smoke .
oh , i love to eat it ,
it , it really is , uh ,
and we were just , you know , dirt poor .
he was for sanctions .
actually --
the children thoroughly enjoy ,
and then i supplement that with , uh , radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week ,
and we got quite a bit of rain ,
he was just , you know , he was getting so old and had a , other problems too .
there are marvelous b m w -s and mercedes and cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns .
he had to , you know ,
they have made so much money from that , that they built , they bought a brand new fire engine ,
i , for years i did all that shopping and whatnot ,
well , i , i felt a little cheated at tech , also .
and i , i 'm trying to think of , oh , isaac asimov , robot series .
and everyone else watched it .
uh , i , uh , when i was younger , i played a little bit
they 've always been involved .
but the drugs did n't work for long ,
i thought about that .
and i 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin .
she also works --
and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time
and the second was this phone call from buddy ryan , i got fired can you believe that .
and , uh , that , that i would like to go ,
i 've never heard of that .
but , you know , he , his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing , you know ,
that was a shocker to me .
uh , at one point in time we 've had au pairs ,
a cat has nine lives --
so that was interesting .
and now they want to put it in ,
i , i used to think that i was probably the only one that just , i do n't know , was running around so much .
real good .
and , even in high school you could say high to your teachers , unless you 're in that biology class ,
thirty years ago i guess there were color t v -s ,
because her statement was , i told him let 's face it
it 's nothing like houston .
and then i have a five year old daughter
m- , m- , m- , my sister , who also lives here in dallas , uh , tends to , uh , chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner , which drives me absolutely batty .
and --
i do n't like those styles , um , the m p v is more of , uh , uh , just , uh , i do n't know what you , normal , ,
me , too .
we 've been there twice .
there are evenings especially friday nights , thursday and friday nights .
and , and i keep saying this , uh , to , to do the different things that we did .
they went to a trial by jury .
i 'll keep that in mind , yeah .
it 's not always ,
and i thought that was real neat .
and you know , talking about fields , people going into different fields , i made an off , off the cuff remark about lawyers ,
but it , it , you know , we looked at a lot of houses that were , had more square footage ,
and that , the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days , and would have to be hospitalized a day or two ,
my son ,
and now it 's called roberto clemente .
we , we bought everything in a grocery store .
and it was wonderful .
and she said i am not doing it anymore .
but , but she enjoys it .
and , um , you know , i , i know that when i , you know , when i get his book i 'm , i 'm usually going to enjoy it .
so --
and ,
but t i is up there ,
and he 's , i , um , got him in arizona --
well , you know , i put mine back in my bag this year , too ,
i 'm in garland .
usually we go to church on sundays .
and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one . one at a time .
i 've never seen that program .
well , my husband smokes .
like if they 're coming to late work all the time and , uh --
and , uh , they have n't had a reunion since then .
i was a photographer before ,
but , even if they had three car garages , they did n't have a work space .
you know , and he wants to be an engineer ,
well , they 've , uh , statewide raises ,
we call it an old folks home ,
because there are other people around that , uh ,
it has been like four years since i have been home .
i agree with it .
but i 'm , i 'm , that does amaze me .
i guess we 're supposed to talk about what 's being done about recycling .
my , both of them are either in or out of college ,
one 's in iowa .
and there 's nothing you could say bad about him , except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person --
-- so i got it back .
but now they do n't .
i do n't really get out as much as i , uh , as i would like too .
i 've driven some , uh , tauruses over the last couple of years when i 've been on business trips .
i 'm from colorado ,
um , work- , workmen 's comp is a big thing now in , in texas because , um , um , how much it costs the employers --
hey , i tell you what , preparing a little pig is , is a snap ,
i mean , if you think about those years that we had the losing season , of how bad ,
-- and , um , there 's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt --
i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial ,
and then you put , um ,
you do not get into your major until like your second or third year .
i 've never heard of it .
i do n't know how i would feel about it .
but , uh --
well , i , i do n't know if it 's been five minutes yet or not .
and i do n't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to .
uh , course that was not , uh , restricted just to just us .
so ,
and so i ha , have a lot of books in my home that i can read from the classics ,
-- so , we 're , we take trips pretty often .
all the science classes and that , i 'm just not really enjoying too much
i can see if ,
i- , it , just that 's how it affected him .
i mean , our credit cards are out to the max right now because i 'm --
i was brought up with tuna fish , you know , where you put in , uh , oh , chopped hard boiled eggs which is --
and then if you get injured on the job , if you like trip and fall or something , uh , they give you a drug test right away .
i had this like , you know , i had a binge of bo- ,
it 's on eleven ninety .
i says , you go pay to have someone do it .
and so that , that , uh , that can be a problem if you do n't put all your equipment away .
and every time i , uh , i spent money , i mean cash mostly , i would , uh , write it down --
uh , i found real quick that was n't for me .
i guess the seville , probably or .
um , well , i actually do some work , working at m i t and at nist , national institute of standards and technology --
i also use my p c to emulate a mainframe terminal for our i b m mainframe --
and then ,
but , on the other hand , i do n't mind that it 's only on , you know , things that are n't like groceries and that ,
there 's twelve troy ounces to the pound .
well australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the united states .
and bob is his patient
-- and so my budget comes from my dad 's help .
i 've heard that that 's really good for you to do .
you know , i thought i would go to florida a couple summers ,
i always wanted to know who an expert was .
so it 's probably out in that direction ,
as long as mother was , you know --
well , since i just turned forty , i 'm thinking about a forty year old man 's car , something , uh , something real sporty --
and did , and i really did n't find much improvement .
it 's , uh , it 's , it 's not like it used to be even in , in the years of my growing up .
i have several chores and things to do ,
so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then .
i mean , they were ,
and so i went to my doctors last thursday ,
that 's not a broad enough topic .
and , uh , it was practically new when i moved in here
it was like , uh , want an autograph , want to stand in line for about four hours .
the last two years before , they 've had record rainfall .
i went shopping .
and , but this year we 're not going to be taking one for several reasons .
so it 's different than the , than the long texas ramblers .
and just normal driving did n't do it .
i mean --
oh , i would love one of these .
and then when we- , eventually , when we have kids ,
their best player this year , you know , averaged twenty points a game --
-- and they just get away with it ,
and i try to cover up when i do the lawn .
so by that time she was so well established , you know ,
i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more .
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that , um , they 've had some problems with ,
so , my kids , luckily , are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk .
i 've been a christian five years ,
oh , i 'm pretty much for it .
but fortunately it rains
they , you know , usually let her ,
-- i do n't know if you can ,
i 'm extremely liberal ,
it seems like she does n't write as often as , oh , well , like danielle steele and those silly things .
so now they 're hitting me up there with a finance charge .
i had gone over to texins
i 've just received some .
-- as , as an athlete , i just hate that .
i do n't remember for sure now .
and i thought just purely for entertainment , i might enjoy that .
i go there on business ,
probably the other thing i do which i am sure will sound horrible to you , but is i program for fun . uh , on the computer .
i do n't know .
and , um , i had never had saki .
so . and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities .
i do n't , i do n't think i 'm a real true , trooper , you know , when it comes ,
but i 'm open to try anything ,
i think it 's just a matter of priorities .
and i enjoy that because i like the group association , you know , like exercising with other people .
and ,
so for instance , in , um , the last presidential election , i 'm sure a lot of people thought , oh , bush is going to win either way ,
-- and , uh , that they required you to do .
and you have a , they have an attorney for , you know , attorney for you and attorney ,
but it is a hobby too , that i enjoy --
but i doubt i do it more than three times a year .
we do n't .
but i think there was something like , you know , thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail .
uh , washington , d c ,
and it really raised a lot of money for the , for the state .
and she 's six months
and i , i 'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like , you know ,
it 's scary to me .
supposedly , the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with honda or whatever
but we have , we have a very aggressive recycling at work ,
i mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff ,
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that ,
uh , retirement .
it 's been a , a fun break ,
but i do n't remember what they look like .
well , i 'm not really worried about it ,
and my allante has , uh --
they 're all , you know , going ,
i tried it like once or twice
so we cook a lot of pasta , and , uh , gravies , and pizzas , and , you know , roasts , and that kind of thing .
my kids are older --
it 's just me in the house ,
and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people do n't get to see ,
and i wish they did .
and they 've , most of them have been pretty good ,
i 'm from north carolina .
i do n't know if the camping that i 've done is really roughing it without a , a whole lot of stuff .
just go in and say , oh , i want to be a juror ,
oh , well , i 've got one in college .
on the one hand i , i guess i admire the person who has the guts to do it because i could n't --
uh , i re , received , uh , uh , several books for christmas
and she is now into consulting
wisconsin has a , a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag --
and things are quite different there in terms of that .
they 're just very tough on criminals .
but , they said she held up so well yesterday .
but we have , uh ,
and we recycle paper .
we do n't eat desserts much any more .
but , uh , he , he said he enjoyed it
as far as other countries , i 'm not , um , i do n't keep up on it too much as to far as what , you know , as what they 're do .
i had , uh , a similar , uh , experience .
and , and they are wonderful people
it 's a little north of indianapolis , about an hour .
and i , i ended up graduating with like a three point six .
and so they just fit in there .
i think --
uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used to be much more stable .
and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit .
but my dad 's the type he would n't want to spend the money on anything .
we never used to have to water our lawns --
but , i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine , i 'm not , cholesterol , i 'm not worried about it .
i 've got , uh , a couple older cars ,
you know , the fir- , the whole first nine weeks of school is , is used as a review
they put one on the parents , or the teachers and say they have to , the men have to wear ties
but what we would ,
we usually watch l a law ,
so i would say that 's one of the largest changes in , at least in my life .
i think it 's , when it 's good , it 's just a scream .
and phone numbers , and , and that kind of stuff .
and say , huh , you know , why should we vote ,
basically it , it was called mustang magazine
most of these are young people .
so i do n't know how --
so i thought that i would put that ,
uh , there are supposed to be , uh , some people f- , moving down here from colorado springs for t i .
i just thought i 'd ask that because i wondered what you thought they might think .
i know it just --
this entire neighborhood , everybody keeps the places up real nice .
that kind , that 's the kind i like really more than ,
so i 've gone up to indianapolis on occasion to visit friends --
and they dumped it all on the local school districts .
and the wind came in from the north
we just , my wife and i just recently moved into our house .
it is really the , uh , aerobic work out part .
and one of the plano school district 's , you know , goals is that they will graduate every child that , uh , that is here in the ninth grade ,
my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while .
so , that 's it
and , and , uh , so , i , i , i appreciate his too ,
we do n't have h b o .
and so what i did , i switched to liquid ,
and lot of times we do n't answer the phone , probably when i get mine --
and we only have one .
uh , now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they ca n't use ,
it 's cajun type stuff .
it was every summer we got together .
but , uh , instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about , uh , i am starting to split stu- , split stuff up .
but we did n't get to watch it tonight .
and one of my other favorite shows is sesame street because of the kids .
gardening in texas is really interesting , though .
and he , he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when , uh , people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion --
and there 's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine
kathy and kevin guy .
-- and , and they keep saying , you know , oh , it 's wonderful , it 's wonderful .
that 's the next project that i 'd like to learn to do .
you sit there
that was next on our list ,
i live alone in an apartment , and , uh , --
so it , that makes a lot of difference to me .
they were used to be used on ships and in , for , for mousers --
so i kind of grabbed on to that team ,
t i is at least ,
we do n't , we do n't usually cover ours .
well i 've never ,
sometimes it just sits around for a while ,
but two years ago , i joined , well , it 's not quite two years , it 's almost two years , i joined the cosmopolitan lady here in plano .
and i said , you know how when you have a bad one , you say , never again --
so , um , we usually meet like at my uncle 's cottage in the , um , at the lake and , uh , make a couple days of it .
so , if they 've just taken such action , it would seem to indicate to me either they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state , or maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish , or hispanic heritage .
i , i was stationed in , in turkey for , for a year and a half .
but i know that at day care they have more of a , a routine like at- , maybe in , uh ,
well the thing that 's funny is they 've done , uh , they 've done things like that , you know ,
and i- , it 's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff ,
anyway that 's what we have ,
but , uh , in this case , uh , spouse and i , uh , are , uh , we 're , are , are , uh , united in this area because ,
and then all of a sudden i 'm saying i wish i 'd bought these things .
and then he ru , he 's a runner , too .
there , there 's a guy ,
it 's , it 's one of the reasons why , you know the godfather 's been on our minds lately .
i mean i have n't had one yet .
we 've taken that this year ,
maybe brian will still be up , and spend some time with him .
but , uh , it seemed like there were quite a few --
i mean her , all her kids were sick
and that was kind of iffy ,
and then inevitably i am swept away by the , the pressure of other types of things ,
and that 's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me --
all the teachers , like about half the teachers are degreed teachers .
and we like movies ,
financial self defense is the name of it . uh ,
whatever he makes , it 's all out of the same thing .
if there was , if there was mandatory , you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary ,
i 've sailed some .
so like i wanted to go out and kill them too .
well --
and by christmas time we went down to the pound and got him , uh , i or , i gue , humane society and got , uh , got another one , a stray .
the majority of my camping experience is , uh , a tent by the lake type situation or , uh , maybe a canoe trip or something like that .
and there are trees that , that still have their leaves on ,
i love old , good old ,
it 's increasing .
boy , we really got to know the kids well .
it was like only , it was either sixty percent or forty percent , go to college .
they propagate pretty well , those little fish .
um , the , the other side of that might be if , if someone found out something or surmised something that were n't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense .
but , but i feel like if i did , i probably would feel that way .
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
but she had , she had le , called and left a message on our recorder
budgeting activity in our household i , has is , uh , uh , kind of an informal kind of situation .
i do n't just read everything about it ,
but it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist .
i mean , the guy 's twenty , twenty-five home rums , maybe thirty , eighty some r b i-s .
but now we 're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports .
and we will be working together .
uh , i think they call it car jacking around here .
and our next door neighbor was there ,
and they had a centennial here awhile back .
and --
uh , you know , it 's kind of , i guess it 's kind of like , uh , there in the bay area , you know , you do n't find a whole lot of , uh , of sacramento fans .
i think that 's right .
and , and he got himself pretty far along , i guess they did n't have kids until he was about , twenty sev- , twenty-six
i usually try to guesstimate
language too .
uh , i live on the outskirts of baltimore
i took it to an independent --
i think he 's very interesting
uh , uh i , i should say something .
i 've , i 've , uh , made some small things , cross stitch things .
i , i really do .
but , uh , i- , i 'll do that in a minute .
but , uh , i think the only , the main thing is just keep on the , legis- , your legislator 's back , you know , as far as ,
here we go .
uh , and , and matter of fact , i think it took like three tries t- , for it to go through .
but in the rain , oh , i love to run in the rain ,
they wanted to watch pretty woman , which i have --
so , if you start putting them , you know , you can put them out in the spring too ,
you know , i had a ,
-- and it will be at this time of the year
they both moved way out .
and so they ,
he wo n't even let my son shower .
and , my husband and i have just elected that if that happens , i will go and just pay .
uh , people recognized dallas , texas , by the , the texas , uh , the , the cowboys --
i may still be ,
and , then we also put sausages on a bun ,
there are so many games in , in a year that they 've got to have repeat customers .
when he was in high school , he enjoyed going to baseball games .
it really does bother me when i think about , you know , leaving our children with , with this sort of , uh , a national problem that we ca n't seem to find an , an answer to it , uh ,
well , i call my lawn man , eric , whatever his name is , i ca n't remember .
we usually watch the local news and the , the , uh , national news both .
they went , i do n't know , how many miles an hour .
but --
and the time that my , we spent with our dad was , he owned his own business
but , uh , that friend of mine 's telling me that i might have to go in for , uh , as a witness .
we did go camping in arkans- , not arkansas , oklahoma .
but it bit enough to where i let go .
technically it 's two days ,
i change oil ,
um . i never heard of that .
and ,
so we 're expecting our local economy to ,
because --
i do n't know how much ,
get an extra bedroom or a basement .
uh , we have some flowers that have ,
and i used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to minnesota ,
um , as i say , we got it from the humane society ,
they can if they choose to .
it 's pretty hot down here during the summer ,
it 's the strangest thing , though , uh , children , no matter how strange they are , or how new they might be can walk , uh , right up to her ,
they 're just delicious .
i remember feeling annoyed , again , i did n't have a kid with me , and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom , the , from older to younger generation ,
just since december .
of course , you just threw it away .
we , we have a real fog problem . um .
well , you get , uh , one free
i just have one child .
i 'm scared , i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out ,
first of all i do n't like a machine that 's smarter than me .
like my husband .
um , and , and , i mean , by saying i like them , i like their chances .
and --
and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally .
and --
not that i know of .
i would probably do that .
i mean --
it 's just , just the special effects , you know .
it 's about seven fifteen .
and so not only would you hear ,
and then that 's get half of the government , rid of the half of the government payroll .
they 're instructed , uh , so that , this , this electronic monitor --
and the other is the oklahoma sooners .
and i was thinking , you know , it 's supposed to be a family place over near plano super bowl .
and we did n't know that .
if he wants to use it , he has to go get it
i am .
-- i do n't really understand it --
well , and also in a sense , they 're giving you a loan for a month
and i had a ceiling fan put up ,
-- and you mix it up ,
and you get an idea on how well the , the next car 's going to be .
and if you get a big enough one , then you 've got a little motor on it also , where if it 's light wind , you can still putt around a little bit and have fun .
and , um , butler , butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh .
there 's a lot of --
i think the demand 's gone all , down a little bit .
do n't ever let age ,
and they 've also see that there 's , there 's a different way of life and those families are really close .
and today i know when i got up that the temperature said more like , close , seventy-nine or eighty --
oh , i just saw one on the video .
that is what ,
fourcade was for a while .
and it was great . uh ,
i like u s news and world report .
but we keep cool just by going swimming
but , uh , yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that , uh , in the state capitol here in austin , texas , they had been , uh , looking at a bill , uh , making it easier to accept the bill to access , to access handguns
well , a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who 's chinese and immigrated from china .
and , um , i 'm working at a day care right now .
i 'm thirty-two ,
you know , so you ca n't ,
i 've seen that .
it just , you know , all the problems .
i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do .
it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things .
and she knows it 's wrong ,
but , , i 'm wondering if there 's another issue here ,
it 's everything but .
-- and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars ,
well , they 've always done a lot of camping .
uh , he does a lot of local stuff there in san antonio
i 've already ordered from that one ,
and , and , uh , we had , mumblex my husband had a conference in l a ,
well , occasionally we 'll have a person here or there , but not , not as many as the phone calls ,
just regular , uh ,
we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home , because there 's just ,
so , it was n't like it was going to be this big raw place or something , you know ,
and , um , and i 've never thought about a cruise .
and i 've never seen another bill ,
he helps me out a lot
and that was nice .
give me break , you know .
uh , i , um , i used to , uh , i used to weigh , uh , two hundred fifteen pounds ,
and i liked it ,
we 're , it 's too small around here .
now i do n't particularly like either one of them --
well , i thought i heard a little tennessee in there somewhere .
he 's doing , uh , quite a bit of consulting work and ,
and he 's kind of , he 's entertained by it .
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back , which we said we 'd do , if the trees hang down
i 'm glad that there are still some areas that , that get the youth involved in that sort of thing .
she 's relatively happy ,
i would go from one side of the boat to the other ,
it had a social message to it
-- and he owns a lot of acreage that 's been farmed properly , you know --
and , i had to always ,
it 's been suggested .
but , um , it was kind of hard for me to think , here 's someone as wealthy as he is ,
i 've never fly fished .
and it was so small
and the switchboard 's been down for several days ,
so i like that .
and they have so much to spend
i do n't think i went to any of them .
he said well , he would n't really talk about it .
i mean it was a chemical handling type .
uh , you name it , they tax it .
but the other ones are very special getaways ,
well , we got a , i think we got a pretty good newspaper .
i know they 're really proud of independence .
so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room --
they gave them food and uniforms
and then ,
but it 's not really a credit card .
and i have two children also .
i need it , too ,
that makes sense then .
almost everything is the same .
and the , and the inventory 's going to have to be restocked , uh ,
and i pumped it up .
and it was just so wonderful .
i just do n't even want to do anything .
and i love the little preschool they are in .
we went , uh , six months after we were married .
-- and , uh , so basically what i 'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things .
i use to have one ,
and they went to court ,
so lots of times ,
at least drug addiction can be treated whereas aids , so far , can not be .
i never have .
-- we , we check that and , uh , the friday section in the newspaper --
i 'll , i 'll probably have about , two , two and a half years left .
i never watched knots landing ,
the poor got poorer ,
i , i have some neighbors across the field ,
see , i work in the automotive air bag industry , where we make the safety bags --
they , they want me to call down there every so often .
because those people vote ,
-- and of course the price was just astronomical compared to tech --
and we questioned her about what she fed them and , um , what she did with them during the day and , um , you know , just how she treated them , how , how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and ,
or , i think it 's a limit now ,
it was , uh , an industrial company , and , you know , that t i purchased ,
my sh- , my shell credit card , i use that ,
my husband has taken us to work with him ,
but i kind of would like to get a more , uh , gas efficient car --
my littlest girl she 's still like wants mcdonald 's , mcdonald 's , mcdonald 's .
but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of europe ,
and i will work on one for a little bit , you know , and then the next one .
it bent in the bumper and the quarter panel ,
and , uh , i guess dress it up with a , with a , a very nice black jacket when i have , have visitors or have to give talks .
and you know the , they have the no shorts deal ,
but , the cowboys did good today .
and i like it more .
i really miss them . you know .
i , i come from a family of , um , of , uh , take care of your elders , i guess .
and so , uh , after he took that merit badge , he did all the shopping and preparing , getting ready for it .
and what she does is she ,
and then , oh , those rating , uh ,
there 's a lot , you know
i am sort of rereading it .
i 'm from the east really ,
we , i 've probably personally take i think just two --
luckily i came from a house in colorado which had the cathedral ceiling
so , the only thing that i use is soap .
and --
i do n't think they 're were in this area
and ,
and , so now we , we , we branch out at this wendy 's or some other fast food joint .
and , because it 's full , full scholarship .
um , i played the accordion for seven years --
i need to go thin them out .
i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves . um , since i do n't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite .
but it was , it was saying do n't do star trek management style .
where , where it 's more interesting .
but i should have .
and i process some ratings and put , do graphics for their television stations ,
i 'm ,
so you see people who are severely injured , very , very badly , lose control of body functions --
sure there were cuban soldiers there ,
we , we announced that we were going to war ,
so , uh , i 'm really quite active in trying to , uh , be proactive at least for children 's issues .
oh , we 're really excited about it .
-- and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle .
so really the only bills i have is rent , utilities , insurance --
uh , he was , he was a veterinarian , and killed two , a father and a son , okay .
but i think it was the store .
and the first time i left him we went overnight camping .
and our grandmothers had to bake brownies
-- and you , uh , just cook them very , very slowly in the oven .
i , i , think , maybe , uh , four summers in a row , uh , we spent , uh , our vacation time in the summer , uh , four wheeling through , uh , portions of , uh , the southern half of colorado
you 're , you 're not going to want to have him have that cri- , uh , that punishment .
i do the occasional push up and sit up .
but i get --
but , um , i just ca n't come up with any names here ,
we do n't , i , i do n't know of a written figure of expenses that we , you know , keep to or anything ,
i 'm out of state .
and we gathered wild berries ,
and , uh , one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro --
i did n't buy it really .
and they have , they keep their cages real clean .
some of my suits i have n't put on for quite a --
and the average , you know , the average , uh , first frost is like the fifteenth of november here --
infant . uh ...
well , just today in the mail i got , uh , i got , got my guaranteed acceptance by , uh , american express .
that 's because he 's probably doing what i do , worrying about ,
but , he , he 's one who believes in credit cards ,
and it got real cold for a little while
well , that 's all you can do .
and they 're sort of getting restless ,
but , um , he really does cook
well , to be honest with you , i 'm not from minneapolis .
well , the housing here in maryland is just atrocious . and in , in the entire d c area .
that was very funny .
and , uh --
we have it in the break area , c n n .
i die every time companies like general dynamics ,
uh , i really like that coverage .
i do n't have to run to the store to buy or look for something i have n't heard of .
we just have not gone that direction yet .
and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house .
i , uh , i left t i in january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money .
and i always tried to show my wife , you know , here 's how you ,
i was , uh , i had two cadillacs .
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers . you know , with with children between the ages ,
granted , you know , i 'm paying for my grandparents --
the subscriptions ran out
but to them that would be a suicide
from , from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live .
i ca n't think of anything else to say about that either .
was it jerry brown ,
and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home , is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years .
it was , uh ,
i 'm pretty , i think i 'm pretty satisfied with , um ,
it was absolutely hideous
i 'll never forget that
in fact , christmas we drove to california , which is my home ,
i , uh , started back to school .
several years ago when i was up in , uh , cleveland , i was staying at the marriott
and they predict , you know , of course , it 's going to keep going up .
it seems that progressive ,
washington --
-- but , um , they were in the area where i live --
i 'll glance through it .
and , uh --
so , well everybody , it seems like everyone is so particular , especially in the dallas area .
i do n't know too much about it either .
they shu , they shuttle them in and shuttle them out
i 'm in north carolina .
but , uh , we 've been , we 've lived here sixteen years
it 's making that , that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it .
but , i , uh , it was the first time i have , i have ever found out that the , the , nobody else used celery seed .
but we too do the same thing as far as , uh ,
if it 's not a heavy biography , you know --
i , i mean , as i said , basically all i 've done is go back and forth to parents
and uh ,
though i , i could n't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says , this is bach , you know .
and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape , you know , you could follow this , this beaten down path ,
but i do n't know who they are , you know .
we , we wa- , we try to catch that most , most nights .
it was on network t v a couple of times .
-- and the other cities it was n't nearly as bad
and i told my husband ,
i work with the state ,
because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like , gosh , i 'm going to have to go out and buy a c d player and then start collecting c d -s ,
but he has changed , um , the brakes
-- but , uh , uh , i do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding
you 're the opposite of me .
course , when our big ones were little , we lived up north , you know --
i mean , not , not that badly --
-- i 'm thinking white narcissus or something --
i , i know we get discount tickets --
she 's not in a nursing home . uh .
and they 're selling , you know , you know ,
and there 's rats in the attic , you know .
so that 's , that 's a very good place to eat , the blue mesa grill .
so , i did n't have much of a role model to go by .
and he introduced my brother and i both , to a lot of it .
well , i just watch them .
when teeing off i- , i 'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground
and there , there were crayon marks on there
i 've been there like , maybe a dozen times .
um , i 've enjoyed speaking with you ,
you 're right .
it 's like something around sixty , sixty-five percent or so now .
but people are more sympathetic to it .
and that 's all i plan to do .
this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch
so , she tried to enter her number
and , uh , and i , i , i do n't know what , what has , what has set it off or what
otherwise you can , uh , guess you can put , also put money , hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed or can just have that money , you know , put in your paycheck .
i , i never did care for him as , in the james bond movies .
and when i arrived at her house , she was engrossed in that .
they really do .
and like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , uh , about three years old .
we , we 've just got a freeway .
i guess the car too .
see , i had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago .
but a lot of silly little questions .
that proposed it ,
i just hope it does n't go up any more
it --
and , uh , you know , some of it just seemed rather extreme .
and my cousins , they just go stay with their mom and dad , you know --
and our city will pick up our recyclables .
and at christmas we always get two days at christmas .
it 's almost three years actually .
i did n't .
oh , this is the ,
this guy had supposedly , uh , strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose .
but other than that i do n't have much feeling for , for the benefits ,
i 've just been singing every chance i get .
woodstock .
and it just .
so they developed this , uh , drug policy so that , uh , to eliminate ,
i do have one plant here ,
i , i 'd have to confess i do n't really scope out the new orleans games , per se .
that 's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly .
i , uh , thought i was smart , ran away and got married ,
so , i thought that was interesting .
my husband is a physician ,
so i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old
-- it 's got to have everything .
he 's so off the wall that , uh , he 's gone in and tried to get into city elections
and still i was so sore
you know when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those --
it 's real quick .
i do n't , i do n't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching .
uh , it 's a pretty big expense nowadays .
i did n't , i did n't really think about that .
that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country , too .
but we 're set now .
i like to have ,
and her , her mother went over there just for that ...
so we went to see soapdish ,
oh , it 's sweet ,
um , where i work is predominantly male .
but here i am , you know , cheek by jowl with our nation 's capital
now see your computer ones ,
and she said well , uh , why , you know .
so , i just used a , like a semigloss .
see , well that 's , uh , the , there was another call on saturday , saturday that was also from , uh , that was the one from california .
-- and then i just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment , kept up with that .
and we took that ,
uh , i 'm , i 'm afraid to go see that one .
being a child , you know .
we , we 've gone with friends each time .
so i 'm always very careful when i change hoses on it .
uh , you know , about a minute or so .
they only come out four times a year ,
i do not like the humid- , .
it 's like any other symphony .
this is baltimore , maryland .
i do n't know why .
i ca n't ,
and ,
it 's through baxter labs . uh ,
she did .
i , i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most , uh , that i was really the most in shock with was probably , uh , star wars .
and he was out of town last weekend
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation .
the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decision
i mean , you 're far enough away now i can tell you since this is locally , i make sure , we 're going to romania in a few weeks .
they , they show very well un- , they show very well unless you have , you know , lived in a lot of houses around the area ,
as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we 're equally matched because i can meet him blade for blade .
nissan is japanese .
and mixes it with the , with the warm air coming off the atlantic ocean .
you had the , the russians against the americans , the communists against the free world ,
uh , i work part-time
the company i work for furnishes ,
so it 's full of smoke when , when you go in there .
every time you buy a container , no matter what it is , whether it is glass , whether it 's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever , you pay ten cents for it --
you go into the coffee house
and it just goes out with our trash ,
and i do n't have to to be writing checks
um , i have some spiro gyro tapes .
we put them out for people
um , august , eighty-eight .
but , i did n't . uh .
and , you know --
-- and we have a lot of , uh , beautiful fresh water streams that come through thi- , this area .
oh , i love it .
i subscribed to time and u s news and world report .
now here in , in texas , uh , all you need is a driver 's license .
it was pretty scary because i was visiting a v a hospital , uh , near to where i live
and there 's a lot of graft , like people trying to tell them , oh , giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it .
anyway , uh , i had a friend that read a book on that
and basically it , it was a motor
i was n't buying , you know , just to hold onto it .
anyone who does n't vote , it 's fine with me as long as i can have their vote .
and i would n't be for total banning of , uh , all information
and i did n't , i do n't like devon rexes at first .
but , you know , her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is ...
i 'm from , uh ,
well , i , i was in english as a matter of fact , and --
and , and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth .
i do n't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something .
and i was going to try something weird which , you know ,
i ca n't either .
-- and i work with him a couple days a week --
and , and when my mother lived with us , uh , the cat was really hers
it was kind of an orangish brown .
and ,
i 'm , um , i 'm a struggling single mom .
and i notice today kids , you know ,
so , uh , i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it .
and i do n't have to worry about keeping records of anything else --
this is the first year we 've done it this way .
but i am not an athlete at all .
uh , there 's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes
i feel so silly
let 's see , one of my friends had a roommate that worked for t i
i do n't know if it 's air pollution it 's , uh , it 's dust pollution whether it 's natural or not i do n't know .
-- and then we subbed it out ,
but i just , i like the , the cut and dry solve the mystery ,
i mean there is --
i do
or you 'll hear thirty and think , boy --
it was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river --
-- and , uh , but she , she enjoys it
it 's funny how we , uh , we , we romanticize people --
he 'd come out to the kitchen ,
and then , um , on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves .
the , the new character on there did .
so , you know , i 'm one of these , you know , ten , twelve , fifteen , twenty hour a day type people .
and , but this was n't so fun this last time for nathan to , to get out there
so i really like that about this area .
he either hits home run or strike out .
i do n't know .
so , usually i do n't get a whole lot of news watching in .
and a lot of them go over the border , especially like mercedes .
and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable .
by administrator i , i think i mean ,
i have n't recently , um .
it 's very successful for some of ,
and , in fact , i stock the same part ,
-- and , uh , it was , it was a real lemon .
um , well , i likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs ,
or she 's just working like within the school ,
we take the time to , you know , help my daughter ,
or , but sometimes it all comes together .
i wish that i did enjoy it more ,
well i , i do have , uh , a little bit of property ,
uh , other than that it was a mumblex at best .
like i said , i like doing a lot of outdoor stuff ,
but i also , i 've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient , you know ,
-- like you said , i 've worked in different places ,
and then we did all this for him .
i do n't plan on being a starving artist .
i have always liked --
i 've got a new born
well , in saudi arabia , you know , using , uh , alcohol and drugs and something like that , you get the death penalty .
it 's nice to get ,
so , i 've just been doing it , i try to do it every night --
we have brick on the outside
so , i think as they 're getting in college , i just ,
and she just gave me this woman 's name to contact
and our grandchildren are going now .
but
i have n't gotten the chance lately though to play .
well , uh , we always ,
but , but , i 'm not too sure when i put my property tax in , my car tax , my income tax , and these myriad of , uh ,
and i lived in detroit , too .
he had a hot pad
and it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away .
uh , that 's something i 've never really kept up with at all .
but , but , anyway , at the time that 's what i taught .
i , i understand that .
and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them .
they say you ,
if ford was a head and the shoulders above it , i 'd buy a ford .
just some of the times they 're continued ,
everybody died ,
i , i play guitar and , and early years played saxophone .
we got like a penny a pound for them .
something like that ,
-- and whatever you have to put in there to get the , s- , to take the gaps out between the sheets --
it 's , uh , it 's only like eleven hundred square feet .
it had all the vegetables in it ,
-- and during , uh , certain wind directions because we get the , uh , gary , indiana --
and , uh , my family and i , we 're a sit down together family .
and , uh , there 's a big uproar going on right now . uh --
um , computer communications and data transmissions .
while we 're talking , my next car , i 'd like to be sporty and , you know --
i 'm always afraid like , oh ,
actually i , we saw her just the other night too .
i never have either ,
but that does n't mean get three other guys who hit , all they can do is hit home runs and strike out --
and once you 've reached the , the river walk area , which is the tourist area , it 's usually pretty safe during the day , if you 're just kind of cautious and do n't go down the back streets or alleys , and , um , you know , or alone .
my wife and i , you know , as mentioned ,
and i , you know , i do n't wa- , i do n't like to give any at all --
i see that the ,
personally , i think that 's what i was about to say --
so , you know , after bull durham and field of dreams , you know ,
we 've , i 've been all over the states except for pretty much east .
she was a state auditor ,
i know that , uh , uh , one of , one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family .
and , uh , my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school .
the , the twelve and fifteen year old cars , you know , contribute like ninety percent ,
but i do n't know what to do to stop it .
i , i told them i 'd be available during this time ,
-- and i 'll order steak or steak and lobster combined --
but i can really tell the difference , since i have not been able to walk .
and i do n't mind , uh , paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to .
you know , it 's american made too --
she came home and everything in her house was total gone , light fixtures , everything .
i mean , i read it ,
it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in ,
so the whole block was all foreclosed .
i guess , from what i hear , though , uh , next year ford is coming out with their electric cars .
i was just talking to my son today ,
i have the little flower boxes with , um , a v- , a lot of different flowers ,
but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically , uh , so fast --
and our home is really too small for us right now .
so it , it 's , uh , it 's helpful .
so i think that in general the doctor 's fees are probably lower there ,
the reputation was fantastic for this place .
you find them under bricks and all that stuff , where it 's moist ,
and it tore up the people inside the car .
i feel very safe where i am , you know ,
i have n't seen any of those .
we have three children .
so i do n't think i 'll have a problem .
i 'm at home with two little ki- , preschoolers .
i watch with them every once in a while ,
i have n't , i have n't , i have yet to see a basement in a house .
and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it .
well , i was thinking about the other day , um , when i , when dick and i were , oh , many , many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in missouri , um , i went , oh ,
and , you know , he said , i had to , he had to ear- , gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice .
and ,
oh , well , anyway .
mashed potatoes .
but i just , i ca n't bring myself to trust this ,
-- and i have a daughter in texas and one in new mexico ,
we just sort of put out the sleeping roll .
so i do .
so we never have to pay interest
and i think the last one i read like that was scott thurow 's
we lived in the chicago area at the time ,
the only other one i have ,
it 's not , you know , in the same category .
i 've been running since high school --
those are the two i like the best .
i 'm not a real car fan .
to answer that one before we get to our subject , you know , i always get a kick out of republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was , though when it comes to the budget they say well the democrats control all the money
and we probably watch twice as many movies at home --
and , and one , one week it just rained , thunderstormed for a day straight
so ,
that satisfies most of the short term news i get .
well , they seem to be on later ,
-- you know , but we really did n't want to keep him chained up because , you know , we feel like that 's just too restricting for him .
well , filling out the forms and also all of these , uh , statewide and national wide testing ,
well , that 's what she said to us .
and , i tell you , we really want to go --
and it was worked on down there , assembled , and then sent back here ,
because i really do n't have any , um , personal or professional or familial ties down there .
saturday or sunday they were saying ,
uh , the story was ,
uh , they , uh , we , we used to have two papers here in town
they are doing so many c sections --
but , uh , unfortunately for him , but maybe fortunately for us , his health is not great ,
and i , i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents ,
my mother 's a school teacher
used to go on ,
it got to the point where i did n't know what was going on
brick --
i do the same thing .
you take a little time , replace the bushings , you still got a perfectly good starter .
and , uh , i especially liked the prescription , especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time .
i think that is so stupid , you know ,
and i just , i just hate the emotional price a lot of the vietnam people paid ,
and they look like a lily , sort of .
uh , but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons .
well , we do have the two liter soda pop bottles .
but , i do n't know if it was from the , the , the late freezes that were , or the early freezes we had , that caused this tree damage ,
and so right downstairs there 's a facility .
i do n't think so .
we sold a refrigerator through it
it was really very official .
but they both have a lot of credit cards .
this is supposed to be a nice children 's movie , charlotte 's web .
i mean weird .
well , fortunately the red sox , last time i saw the paper earlier this week , were in first place and doing quite well .
and , uh , then she recouped .
and so we pay ten percent --
i have a repairman just came ,
gosh i remember when i was little , uh , we did n't have a ,
i 'm not sure how we get that ,
there 's this stuff called wonder under that you un- , that you iron it on
since galen goes to nursery school ,
me , too .
i mean , hire a professional ,
so , i 've got all the different alcoholics , what they call the blue , the blue book , the big book ,
well , i , i tend to , uh , take two kinds of vacations , the vacations to visit family --
you know , i think he was n't a real mountain man ,
freddy 's revenge part twenty-five or whatever .
we did the one wall but the other trim ,
i do skim over it .
we , we kind of like our boys though too ,
you know , the first time i brought her home , she was only , uh , was it six weeks old .
so i really do n't know what he said .
but they , all the leaves turn yellow ,
-- i know that part , probably half their money comes from these people that are saying , uh , put my ad in your paper --
and it was because i had worked for about nine months ,
and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope
i lost one , one time , uh ,
god , i ca n't even remember the name .
well , virginia is not a particularly rich state ,
and the thing that they forgot to do was to , um , to also look at the hose ,
and you would have sent , you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them ,
and all of a sudden we know we 've got changes made .
and i do n't think i would have thought about that .
so , i 've just recently had to start looking at it myself .
i 'm sure .
we 're going to talk about lawn and garden today .
but most ,
it 's , it 's very , very good . very good .
but you had to find out what level , how many cranks they were off the bottom .
i have to get to know this area a little better , i guess .
and she still works everyday
that 's happened to me once ,
and he 's --
and i try to walk , um , at least five times a week .
and i 'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good .
and then i was a scientist over in central research labs
an , and , i mean , choosing from my experience , you know , i thought , you know , my , i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want .
but i do n't use as many of those .
i heard it was , uh , sort of like , uh , not , uh , too violent ,
so , and i would be glad to see that .
and i enjoy , i enjoy living here in this country
it was sort of just , you know , uh , gets your , get his , you know , my bro- , my brother and well , maybe , you know , my cousin 's coming over today to help us do that --
and they was saying that , uh ,
he thought , what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with ?
my name is leslie .
i 'm sorry they 're breaking the team up , because we liked all the ones that were on there .
but to pay that much money for an automobile , uh , is just ,
it 's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend .
i do n't know what that would be .
-- and she wanted to paint the shed
i do n't like to cook .
and but then they lost ,
it 's just like i , i do n't watch the ball die ,
and they were n't overly revealing .
like i 've had things that i did n't get billed on for two or three months .
they set up kids with elderly people , in the winter time they shovel their snow .
-- and that 's in new york ,
but i do n't .
the brown haze that you see if you look down central towards downtown --
they 're not even there yet --
and , uh , but at least it was , it was over quick
and , and this , and this article said that they 've got a real problem that , um , you 've got toxins and , and , uh , bacteria in the manure that is ,
but , i mean , i do n't know whether they have one of the first , you know ,
i get a newsweek every week which i , i pretty much read that cover to cover
and we had a garden
i go to l s u .
and i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that --
and i get a little bit more time .
well , she was grumpy to begin with .
uh , but i am trying to , you know , leave her a fair amount , even at this young age , with her grandparents , just to ,
because they 're just so well set up with it .
there is a machine that will --
i thought maybe you lived in dallas , because that 's the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too .
but i have my own policy , too .
and we loved it .
and what kind of money do you make
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house
i still just do n't do n't end up going cause it is n't at a convenient time or i do n't know something ,
it was interesting .
i mean it 's , we take it everywhere ,
after we had the house part made , we just decided we 'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less .
and so i 'm pushing that on my daughter because i want to play in our city band , not the symphony , with just the city band --
there 's no bugs .
so i wear a lot of blue jeans ,
-- and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago .
well , my dad 's in the , in the solar energy business ,
and she got really the same basic education that she wanted .
the state did n't have any money
so there were things around there .
when i go out and play golf it 's usually like at a , at one of these par threes that ,
well , really ,
it made us think .
and in the last few years i 've said , no way .
and know if i look underneath my cabinets , i 'm not satisfied with the jobs i , i did on it because there 're splotches .
i use to play an instrument when i was in high school ,
you might put them in the ground just the first week of june --
well , i think they are a lot better than they us , than they were ,
other than that he gets scared to death .
we had never been there .
and , , she pushes the other one away from the food .
oh , close to five minutes , i believe .
uh , the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in , in dallas .
and , and , uh , that 's pretty much all the houses in the area , for probably a square mile , i 'd say , at least , maybe even a little bit more than that .
uh , i have one that i was reading on , uh , raising your children and then another one on a , an autobiography , and another one on , uh , uh , uh , like a crime story .
in my case , i just , uh , decided that , as long as my kids were little , i would be better off at home with them , instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once .
in fact i 'm glad that it 's part of our , uh , basic cable package .
generally ,
but , uh , but i knew that it was paid .
and he 's out of the house .
so everybody ,
so .
for example down here , when you go up to a gas station --
and i 've got little children here who needed me here --
so , once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty-five .
i see it here at t i .
and , they , they pay him as a consultant but he does n't get any health benefits ,
well i got married last summer
uh , communications .
i know in dallas you can probably get two , two all news radio stations out of i do n't how many popular radio stations .
but , uh , they have a pretty good size waiting list .
that what the look like ,
and --
and i do n't know anybody that takes that .
well , you know , they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers --
and --
and i , i really do n't know what , what can be done .
it was so funny .
i mean , i unconsciously , uh , you know , stay in a , within a , with a certain amount because i , i have enough food already stored here --
and , what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
we live in a little small town ,
and i was out of the country and got back ,
so , i joined the air force and ended up staying there for thirteen years .
i only do it probably two or three times a week .
but i 've got eight more payments
i keep forgetting one station .
i , i get kind of , uh , saying , `` i am sorry kids , this is '' ,
we 're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now .
and then with the with the twenty-two dollars and the seven something , it all came out to , i , i ended up paying like thirty-four dollars .
well , you know , there was kind of a connotation there of him being , you know , it being a problem .
but to , to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i 'll spend less on groceries but we 'll go out .
an- , but i ca n't stay up late at night to watch the late news
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we 're going to spend and set that money aside ,
my pet , uh , was hit by a car new year 's eve ,
and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if , if i --
i , i work also ,
the french occupied it ,
it was expensive .
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play
and so a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are centered around my , my children and also things that my wife and i like to do --
it , it , sort of does n't much , you know ,
that is probably one of the most --
i did my master 's thesis on , uh , a typewriter .
you do feel like you 've gone out , you know , and done something ,
and i sort of , i see perspectives on all sides .
so , there ,
i wish i would , you know , i could settle for twenty-eight ,
and it did this .
democratic formed government ,
i know i have to do more aerobics ,
we stayed at ,
and he 's a good dog ,
from new mexico .
the kids i 've worked with so far have been spanish speaking .
i , my friend is , is very generous in , in letting us have my children , uh , do the suzuki method --
and he would sleep with her ,
so this is just really strange .
uh , i 've , i 've got one at home too .
they 've got great big ears ,
um , my husband bought me , like , um , uh , i think pretty in pink for my birthday .
but further down the coast in massachusetts they got hit pretty bad .
but i 'm not interested because we 're moving out of the house next year .
we said things like spaghetti .
so , i guess i really have no fear at all of the u s s r verses , uh ,
i was there before that ,
and i said , then when , when it 's born you can hold it --
and she 's training her .
i , i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do i do n't know .
i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers .
but , um , oh , just phenomenal ,
and , uh , this year it 's been so hot and , uh , sunny
we bought a , a large house that was completely unlandscaped .
we had a boat
they get enough sugar and --
they have some little buds on them hopefully they 'll do something .
and when , whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays , we 'll see other families .
so he always said why do n't you drive a ford , or why do n't you try a lincoln --
she 'd go up and down with her little bag --
and i think they 're getting ready to , to probably sell us out , our division .
and , uh , that was really quite dangerous ,
i did n't get to see that .
but i did a walk last night ,
i 'm , i 'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that .
i 'm not home a lot .
god , i ca n't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff
i have a couple that my husband really hates --
or go rent it .
she likes the chicken and fish ,
and we 're going , oh , no , there goes our recycling place .
well , i did ,
because my brother-in-law lives in minnesota ,
i like that .
and , and he will help you avoid a lot of little things , uh , financially .
but ,
well , i 've always liked that .
and the next day they pulled the white car and took it to arlington .
we did n't know that was a big no , no .
my wife and i always sort of bring this up about sh- , her being syrian , you know , and my being jewish , you know .
and then came a woman that 's um ,
i like the way that , i like the way that idea of the south is ,
but , uh , i- , it , it 's , it 's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think 's going to do me right .
i , i do n't really like it here at all .
the statistics prove that
and it seemed , uh ,
and it seems that well now the bank 's not available .
well , i watch two ,
and so i know what warm is .
you know , so i have tried to just do stuff at home
i work full time
now next time we have one ,
and then the student teacher did n't stay but about six weeks .
and so , we , we , in our minds we 're thinking what 's the big deal .
and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by texas , then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject
it 'll , it 'll automatically ,
and i 'm just feeling really good .
my wife 's from new jersey .
but i think we 're probably past that now .
we 're really enjoying it
we have in texas a large vietnamese population --
he has one of those alarms on his car ,
uh , i ca n't think of anything else , uh .
that 's true that the different places in america that , uh , you know , different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place .
when the people from m c i come down
i 'd like to try , you know , just try something new ,
but it 's , it 's inexpensive --
and , they had put their tent over kind of ,
you can tell when you go around cities , you can smell specific things from , from , specific industries .
we have a , uh , a treadmill and , uh , a bicycle and that kind of stuff ,
i mean , we were just a very small specialized group , too , to get that going and spread
when the time comes i 'm really , hopefully we 'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents --
but the catfish , there 's , you know , there 's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and , that ,
uh , one of the questions was , do you think more should be done , or something else .
d- , dallas is very nice .
and so they start farming on , uh , available land , you know . like the median strips on freeways because no one 's using it .
-- and it was so big , that it might not would have hurt us ,
and the rest is , uh , gets into the cooler weather .
now my husband does that ,
i , i guess i ,
now i have n't been there befo- ,
i had an addition put on --
and , uh , this is , uh , it 's really nice ,
i think the last i heard ,
i think if it 's , uh , if it 's a con , if it 's a convicted , uh , felon on parole --
he was ,
i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy --
but it was just , i missed it by a couple months .
i d- , i never did put things up when my kids were little
but i live in pensacola , florida .
and everywhere you 'd miss there 'd be this little bright spot you could see .
because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television ,
that , that 's more important to us , you know , as , as , uh , there may come a time when i will be working again , you know ,
i , i ,
i , i think we 're started now .
it certainly is .
ca n't put them down .
and then they had , um , you know ,
but i do have my ride ,
but , uh , even now , i would , i would like to not have to work in some ways .
i , i do n't know what foley 's is .
well , i spent twenty years in profession , commercial broadcasting mumblex radio and t v ,
and i think there are some available now where they are able to work ,
and that was hard cause i had two kids ,
and , uh , uh , some rooms , we have one room that we never use .
so when we do go out we really , you know , want to be wowed by , um , the presentation , so to speak .
i 'm thirty-five .
and you can really see real well .
there are more ,
by bly ,
carte blanket .
uh , they do nothing .
uh , i believe in it , too .
cockroaches are awful here .
it took us two or three different people to find ,
and that 's , you know , that 's the way they wanted to do it .
just the events that happen around the world interest me .
in fact , our one little block and a half there , four houses sold last summer
but , uh , what i found out ,
uh , i , i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car
your time becomes very precious
-- and in the same school district , you may , even in an arlington seventh grade for instance , you may have an english class
uh , university of texas at dallas .
well , not totally alike
but , uh , and --
and , um , y- , there 's so many people who want a , a dib of the federal money --
and she 's been a lot of company .
i 'm at , i 'm at , i go to george washington university .
since i always make chicken burritos and just --
but gasoline , of course , now the lead 's out , at least theoretically , uh , i guess you could say we 're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur .
-- and we get hummingbirds come in the --
and because she had turkey a lot , you know .
well , the thing that really did it for me , i was subbing in a fifth grade class
and i think that , you know , if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us , then i 'm for him .
we , we took the morning news for a while ,
we do get the disney channel for the kids .
that 's , uh , that 's what i thought about , was that armenian rice dish .
so i , i really hate that for them .
we 've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields .
but --
it was made out of rice and consume soup , uh , and bacon and onions .
but , in my job , i 'm a nurse , and we are allowed to be .
uh , i 'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation
soldiers are there ,
due , due to the fact that , well , you know , i , i have n't tested the , the p s two yet .
i , i live in , uh , vermont
we just had all the normal ones ,
that 's my other phone .
and , i , you know , uh , seventy women in a jazzercise class in a public , uh , parks and rec building .
and i put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty .
they 're coming up from florida ,
when it finally came down to it , um , she just got to the point after the ,
i went on a cruise .
you 're not supposed to have , like the coupons in there .
and so i respect ,
and , uh , they were , they were given , i think ,
and i used to know as a boy scout
i think we 're going to demolish it .
i mean , it will just in incapacitate them .
but now i want to learn how to knit again .
i do too .
i said you 've been very nice , what 's your name .
but with somebody that needs around the clock care ,
so we 'll go in .
i , i feel kind of weird about that anyway ,
my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government ,
if you go to a doctor who is n't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get .
but still , uh ,
i am in the , i am , uh , manufactures rep sales organization
and i 'm not that familiar with them to know ,
and , of course you know you have the , uh , the weeds that come up in between the bricks or , and things like that .
and then i ca- , i get , i can sell them at a cheaper price .
the robin hood coming out
oh , i heard that was excellent .
have a lot of people trying to do it for me .
and then she 'll polish them again .
and i went skiing
that does n't have any color ,
but --
but and i 've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it .
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket ,
and it was , um , very scary to see what they found out .
we 've gone to , um , germany , switzerland , austria , ireland and england .
well , and one of my very favorite is las vegas .
it 's over three fifty a month .
i 'm mainly a freshwater fisherman .
terry metcalf was on the cardinals .
and i could n't just , you know , wait for eight , three or four months and then bring them back to her --
we are this weekend going to go see dance with wolves .
i mean , they --
and , if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble , just get out of it or call for help , whichever .
but she was n't home , right .
and i like , uh , uh , chuck mangione ,
i do not get too into it .
like --
uh , and then another reason was i was not sure , you know ,
-- and , uh , it 's been kind of nice ,
it 's , it 's made very clear upon hiring .
you , you 're , you 're struggling against your own body weight --
i do n't know how much the stuff actually , what they actually have in there
and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there .
ours , um , ours barks more than , um , than some , because she spent a lot of time at our friends ' house .
i said my goodness , what is it , lined in gold , you know , uh .
um , now if i 'm ever home during the , during the day on a vacation day , i have to catch at twelve o'clock the andy griffith show , because i usually ,
now , the kids would sneak off .
i have n't been in , in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama .
and i came out of there
i know origina- , i know that the dog 's grandmother , um , was from plano ,
it --
that , those prescriptions can be very expensive .
so we went in , and the financed the car for five ,
-- that type of country western is --
because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because i ca n't --
and what they 've done is they 've broken everything down into garbage . uh , yard trash .
my mother 's father 's family had quite a few ,
j r , my , my , my last son --
but my husband is wonderful .
and naturally these are cats ,
uh , it is called the quantum leap .
and , uh , just recently i went back to work , uh , last school semester to tutor , uh , high school age students with learning disabilities
and then we had to write , uh --
it just goes straight in there .
well i do n't really have to worry about that that much because my sons ' bedrooms are in the front
but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better .
they first had a policy where they , uh , would test new employees
they bought ,
but my husband 's working over there
well , i had some of that problem ,
so i 'm single again .
i felt i was losing my family .
uh , his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream , like hair spray .
i like , uh , like i said , pretty varied , uh , music .
they have this day now , that it 's , you know , separate from the other trash pick up .
i think if , uh , i would have went with the math , i think i would have done a lot better , because i was more interested .
and i am , i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now .
and there 's no way i can get her to .
i mean yes i did hear that
it 's wonderful .
uh , there 's a number that you call ,
i 'm on , i 'm in the plano school system and living in richardson ,
and that horse has been such a pal to him ,
it 's one of those transverse mounted v sixes , front wheel drive .
they all were , were tapped into c n n .
and it 's late at night ,
i 'm , uh --
at least what i read , is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their , uh , out of their , uh , budget .
uh , primarily because it , it seems to be a little more , uh , well , let 's say --
well is there enough money ,
they 're called luxury cars even though they 're much more expensive like , like , uh , uh , a mercedes benz ,
i mean , i know it 's dangerous ,
-- and , uh , to stay in condition , i did that , uh , just as a normal --
and they lacked the at- , the , just the , i do n't know .
hamilton college is just a few miles south of , you know , maybe about twenty miles to the south from where i am --
and bob pointed to it
and the mavericks wanted to get rid of him ,
he 'll have trouble picking up his hat , or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind , or something ,
and it had some , some nice features .
i got my brother and my whole family there .
uh there 's not a whole lot of mountains here in texas --
and that 's where i actually get my exercise ,
and , most of the body parts seem to be metric ,
and it brought it to its knees .
and i get to see , you know , people 's , uh , pain and things ,
you really do n't .
i thought it had a weight .
but , uh , we 've learned .
she 's in college .
i used it as a pacifier .
it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses ,
and i thought that each one of his books were good .
and --
a couple times i 've had to write big credit card companies and say , you know , i did n't really get this
a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to , uh , jury duty
uh , well , i would like for one time in my life to have a convertible .
you only have to write one check a month , not all those .
damn it , i agree with pretty much with everything you 've said .
i forgot about that .
what they 're trying to do there is , they want to sort of get a base line measure for you , you know .
right now , i 'm into jazzercise , which i absolutely love .
i 've been with them sixteen .
i do n't even remember if it was in the dallasite or the insite one , about uh , companies allowing you ,
the federal government is trying to intercede on that too ,
and , uh , she 's gotten some , uh , she 's been on like the top ten , i guess , or whatever .
uh , both , uh , joey and , uh , stripper get treats .
i 'm in , from ,
and that 's where shannon had started , in a mother 's day out program --
we , we moved here from houston --
and i- , it , it just is n't chance taking enough for me .
uh , well , it was , well , it was within the state .
i 'm afraid to , i 'm afraid to even think about it .
and they did n't get across the river there
we were just about , we were getting ready to go swimming ,
it 's animated .
i do n't like that place .
i , i 'm , i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them .
the man always gets that chore ,
and during the summer we camp , uh , two or three weeks a year .
our friends were amazed that the sales taxes , the cost of things when they went to canada not so long ago .
we really do n't have that either .
i 'm , i 'm covering , uh , weekends and nights now .
and i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron ,
and i like the national news that we see ,
it 's just always going to be there .
and then , uh , the second day head on down to the , to the pool at the end of the river .
and i 've never been one to itemize on my income , tax and never had enough to itemize
and that they city will pick it up .
uh , we 've , uh , we 've , we 've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood .
it 's , it 's really her joy
so that makes it kind of tough .
and they divided them up between three counselors
and , uh , so it 's , it 's , it 's a good ride
i play in the altoona symphony ,
and we bought a house at the same time .
but sometimes i forget
so , it 's pretty fun though .
number nine , number ten , number --
and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the , of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we could n't think about .
and i was president of our family reunion for two years ,
i do not know that it has egg in it .
and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year .
we 're going to take a cooking class there ,
if you 're in richardson you 'd probably wanted to come to the , to the dallas site .
and she , she hired an au pair , which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house .
but otherwise , he can jump , uh , you know , just as long as he does n't bend a certain way .
do it remotely just looking at the , what they do ,
well , i mostly listen to popular music .
because , uh , you know , i , i do also , myself , believe in capital punishment , uh ,
i loved it .
i do n't follow actors .
it 's great .
and then i 've taken a train before to california .
and we 've already started about ,
i have not skied that area .
since , like i said , um , i do n't have a big problem with , with them .
we have three dogs and --
had n't thought about that .
but , that 's one of the few things that really , uh , immediately pays back on return .
and we take walks .
we have a , a very small phone company down here .
this one guy had , uh , framed himself to make it ,
i 'm , i 'm sort of an acting process engineer .
about an hour .
my next son plays the drums ,
i never thought i 'd have to go through this kind of experience .
and i look at them
i 've had dogs through the years .
oh , i think i know who you 're talking about .
but it seems that , you know , they can sign him tomorrow ,
and i 'm not that familiar --
and then , um , downstairs in the apartment , i just us , we just used a latex base ,
there were some really nice ones here .
one of her acquaintances , one of her old friends , i guess , had been in town
and it 's just , uh , it 's a lot of fun .
i used to like him too ,
and they 'll be having snow .
i listen to some country and western
i may be seeing them , um , in a town just west of here , frederick has a , uh , has a minor league team that plays in the same league with salem
even when you 're eating ,
and i have seen them age twenty --
and pat says no
uh , i would n't mind , uh , you know , getting back into one if they would , you know ,
but all the , all three of them , dog , cat and skunk , used to chase each other all through the house .
and you buy a present ,
it was over crowded
mumblex drove through san antonio
everybody brings their favorite dish
you know , we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something
i can do it on most any day of the week .
and , uh , they also repair them for other the people on their off time --
it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being winter to , you know , muggy , and hot ,
it needs to be put to sleep
uh , i got to s- , get to see a lot of crimes ,
as far as his ath- , athletics , he 's lost all of that .
and it was a lease car
a , a number every week .
but in the middle they sort of , um ,
the thing about when it gets hot here is , i do n't like the humidity ,
i , i was n't either ,
they have to cancel everything .
maybe not the four years definitely .
it was something easily forgotten .
but i can talk to the teacher and tell them , on a pretty good basis , after i 've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks --
and , uh , gosh , sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot ,
a lot of people that work for me that ca n't even spell or read , you know .
uh , but , in general , i , i think the , the , you know , one of the reasons that we , we , uh , the , chose to live in richardson when we , when we came here was the , was the schools ,
but the rest of the time she 's free .
but they 're , uh , both run by the same peo- ,
i 've got an , i 've got an eighty-three t bird
because he 's got one more year before he turns into a free agent .
i sent it ,
and , you know , if , um , i go to townsend --
she 's says how are you doing grandma today .
and --
and , um , the other thing was i 'd never really let injuries stop me .
oh , i generally go to the quickie places just because they 're cheap .
uh , one 's called captain pell 's --
and you know this is the standard pattern .
supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with
i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the ozarks ,
and we went through ,
i do watch the special shows that they come out with , the nova stuff . and , and ,
in fact , they 're , they 're kind of known , uh , for having good benefits .
and , uh , nobody brought covered dishes .
oh , we are too .
i 'm just getting , getting to that age i guess .
well a lot of it in mississippi here has got to do with funding .
and then attached to that is a , uh , twelve foot leash ,
but it got to be pretty big ,
you- , if they had to have a rifle or was ,
we 're not talking somebody that does six kids ,
i have three children
so we see a lot of them .
and then she was upset ,
and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan , if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment --
i like , uh , the true stories .
it is .
i just put them away .
we were closer and , uh , used to go almost every summer , uh , and , rent a condo there on the beach .
and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds --
or , or , of course , we 've already talked , you know ,
and i often find that even when i do n't feel that much like exercising ,
my kids are in boy scouts
i have written this down
the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and could n't get away .
and our local h e b stores here ,
they used to have a ,
we 've been to the humane society ,
i mean , just the very second ,
but i do n't know . all of our family is here
and that was something for greedy old me at christmas time , i 'll tell you .
and we will be living in , in africa
and so immediately she says , well , i ca n't have any confidence in them anymore ,
and she has flower gardens and bulbs , perennials and things .
not yet .
you find them under bricks usually , and that .
i 've been pretty lucky about getting mugged .
so , it was fine for her --
and , uh , so , i try to make sure that , uh , by the time fall runs around , because we actually have winters here on the east coast , um ,
but , uh , uh , it is sad .
that 's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter
i 've seen on t v where they take animals and young children ,
well i 'm planning a ,
hal bought me , uh , uh , small , uh , well , uh , uh , , little jam box kind of thing
that our high school graduates ca n't even match the national average .
you troll it --
and they , they find they , they are ,
he goes , okay .
well , i , i sometimes wonder if i did n't mess up .
before , they did n't .
and we just did , we would make ,
and parents get in free
and so i thought hey , i 'll just try this , you know ,
it 's not as thick and as nice ,
and then , and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now .
she said they could n't see those things out there ,
it takes a lot .
well , that 's what they look for .
well , we keep a shelter , also monies that we 're going to pay in for child care too .
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics ca n't do much with them .
and they have to stay in until they all agree --
-- and i run a municipal band
everybody has a different thing .
well , now , we had some friends that went to see it
least it gets back into the system ,
some laws absolutely prohibit it .
but i would n't ,
and i have n't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis .
usually january and the first two weeks of february .
but they have been more , little more s- , effective in oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it .
we got together over christmas .
you heard her in the background .
and , bri- , my little boy is on- , is just a little over two
oh , we never miss that ,
and i 'm , i 'm not sure i , i see it go anywhere .
he did n't at , at least say to us , did you know you 're not supposed to do that .
well , uh , i , i guess , what they 'd have to do to ,
but you sound so close .
we keep them , uh , we keep , uh , one gas card and , uh , and , uh , visa just , you know , in case there 's an emergency or ,
because we 're , we 're painting the outside of our house .
and , uh , another prosecutor in the , a woman prosecutor in there is murdered --
and i must admit that up until i did start using one , uh , it was , i had very little interest in computers .
and they said , well , people come in and put anything in the receptacles .
and in the summer everyone is like , i think there 's like seven of us still at home ,
we have to drive so far ,
and then , of course , they have a pretty , um , busy social calendar too .
it was n't even a , a full tent .
they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever ,
so i like to rent movies ,
but , so many in our neighborhood had been ,
but , you know , my taste buds are pretty , uh , flexible ,
-- but , uh , she 's been , she 's been working a , uh , on a late shift .
uh , i , i live alone now
i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment .
you know , because wh- , when i was growing up in chicago , um , we were in a real ethnic neighborhood
and when we got back to dallas it seemed really dry ,
and , uh , he left it in the middle of the pond .
excuse me i had health benefits . you know , dental , vision , all that , pension plan , uh ,
well , that 's kind of the way i am , um .
we had cucumbers coming up , you know , in the middle of our okra ,
it 's just we have n't found one that we 've snuggled into .
i know who you 're talking about .
we have it ,
and you can touch everything and stuff .
that 's hard for me to say since i did n't ,
i really amazed to find out that , what is it , eighty per cent are filled now , in , in garbage fills .
and it was hot here ,
i 'm , have material that i cut out ,
i get it from all over .
i just heard something about moving , recently , about moving , um
when , wh , when it first , uh , you know , when it first tuned in on that i , you know ,
we have , uh , an x t
some people i know also try to use it as float --
because the top of the line we 've got ,
and i really enjoyed driving that car .
they , they do have to check them off a list --
and i 've kept it , you --
if i , i wish our leaders were really seeking the lord on these things ,
he goes , we want to keep in touch
uh , all i have to do is hear that song and i get strongly evoked memories of , of difficult times in school being behind on work ,
so . and i do n't know what 's going to happen .
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog
and there 's just not that many opportunities to wear it .
we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and , uh , landfill space is , in deed , the driving factor here .
and , uh , uh , when i 've had so many people , uh , t- , to feed , like i try to do a ham and a turkey
but , uh , there 's , uh , some , some stuff that i want to do with like sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that .
they 're playing tonight in fact .
-- and , you know , we 're eating it for a week and a half ,
well ,
it 's fun .
so it 's real cheap .
so i can tow everything
we get along a lot better now that he 's older .
and then he thinks that he has the money that , that he can spend on something
uh , it must have been six .
and all it , all it did was to , in my judgment , make them ,
-- and , uh , the only thing i have against it in that 's it 's a taurus ,
k l t y .
uh , we have two and another one on the way .
and i said fine .
-- glass
-- and we could n't get the light to turn off .
but i do n't have a regular plan , that 's --
and , uh , she lives in pennsylvania ,
just to do , you know , some bicep , tricep exercises .
-- and then , uh , he 's got a router ,
and we do n't have children
these were n't , these were n't chinese made copies .
um , it was my first wedding .
he should , he should have let them , um , corner the republican guards ,
and they 're going oh , my god .
i saw that movie too .
last i 've heard is that he 's starting to peak right now .
i don- , i do n't know if you 've ever made them , maybe not since you do n't have kids yet , but those jell-o , uh , gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers , i ca n't think of what they call it .
but it was kind of cute .
just the smell is so bad ,
and she turned out to be wonderful .
i 'm twenty-two .
i said a couple of kids ,
and plus the place that i 'd bought them all had gone out of business ,
my job is , uh , e d p auditor ,
i do n't .
-- we , we a- , rendered a verdict
when , uh , i met my husband , he was living in an apartment at the time
-- i have two dogs .
i feel such a responsibility , even when we go out for a few hours that ,
and , uh , and every year we get another list of what doctor 's we can go to , and where we can buy our medicine ,
and --
a quantum leap from left to right hand drive .
when you think about people , uh , taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress .
but when it comes down to just general purpose trash , that all the houses , uh ,
but i have played you know different courses in in the dallas area .
we also grow , um , yellow and green squash ,
i learned so many things that they , they do ,
-- and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time --
uh , other than that , uh , i do n't know ,
about a year ago , we picked up a second hand , uh , uh , audi --
well , they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago , you know , in the public schools .
-- and , um , i think it was on , i have to remember which channel ,
and i really love it . um .
it is .
oh , i could never do that .
now i 've seen another clip of , um , the guy that plays in murphy brown ,
so we 're talking about second and third great children here .
well , uh , for us it 's , uh , uh , you know , it 's like for doing like , you know , like resumes ,
so i do n't even know what the law is ,
uh , but on the other hand , i 'm not sure i would have gone otherwise ,
they get one of these caught being good slips .
i was working at the dallas site .
i would really like to have a sports car .
like i do some volunteer work here and there ,
and they had told their teachers that wh- , i mean ,
but i , i do kind of like to know what 's going on and what 's happening
he sure did .
so , despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or , or going for walks in the mountains ,
and second time we went to munich , germany and were there a week , and loved germany .
they say it 's a dog fish , from everything i 've described ,
but , uh , it 's , so it 's very , very mixed
latest , latest one i 've saw which was a mistake to go see was lionheart ,
i like to catch the gymnastics sometimes , too .
but the language in it is just for no reason , has to stick in ,
i mean , they 're not used to having tourists there ,
it would look absolutely , ridiculously stupid ,
i came down march of sixty-nine , went to work for t and i .
i was suffering for about three weeks later .
and that 's , that 's one thing i do have .
i , i watched that game
inflation is out of this world
i have n't , i have n't heard that .
and they had , uh , ag ,
little , with little kids the t v set really is a , i mean
she has ,
i think it was saint augustine that we had .
we , um , we made a trip up the east coast .
but , uh , i mean , they , they just moved into the new building ,
mumblex work hard to get , you know .
-- and i like some of their songs .
we , i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be ,
and they were real good about taking it back .
and yet , i 'm also noticing , uh , in the areas that i 'm working and stuff , more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago --
well , that 's , that 's a really good idea , because , um , like our , uh , fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit .
i , i 'm living in , just west of baltimore , and frederick , um , which is also just west of baltimore , has a minor league team .
that was unusual ,
i , i think i was paid , uh , about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year --
well , then forget that ,
i do that when we travel .
we have n't really done too much else other than that .
well , he kind of ripped through the chicken wire .
and people would just drink openly .
i get most of my news information from t v .
if anything happens to him , i do n't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i do n't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home .
i was working at that time full-time and did n't have a lot of time ,
well i guess that 's about all i can talk to about budgets .
naturally i 'm married --
and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago ,
but supposedly they 're good ,
so i , my , my vast experience of home , home owner 's knowledge is not very much .
we 're usually picking things up quickly ,
and i bought it , uh , in , uh , eighty-eight
and , and everybody tends to be in the same boat .
the were almost all boys .
i ca n't stand that
and that was kind of fun .
i do n't think i 'd know where to start with a diesel .
they 'll take colored folders ,
we , we had the same type of situation .
but , you know , we do n't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
and the back fence was open .
and they want to become industrial --
which she does n't allow them to watch the soapies .
or , i , i , i also subscribe to something called world press , which is --
so , i mean people are still wearing shorts
so , uh , um , i try to enjoy all of it .
uh , it was , uh --
um , and it 's one of those that i can ei- , read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i 'm going to spend in there .
well i do n't think you all have the same channels ,
i do n't have a lot of time
me , too .
and , uh , we 're , they 'll be there for a while .
and , uh , plus i , i , uh , wanted them to get something out of it ,
but , um , a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more , um , where they could manage their own schedule
and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that was n't ,
a hundred and ten degrees
but it 's a little ways off in the future --
and , uh , i , uh , went to purdue for a couple of years ,
so ,
in fact , i was going to school while i was working fifty-one hours a week
that 's how bad it ,
but --
i was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time .
i listen to ,
she got , you know , five hundred dollars at a , at a clip through bands , through leadership .
and , um , normally what happ , what we do is , um , just , you know , like two tablespoons of oil , maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi- , vegetable oil .
i 've only done this one other time
but nobody , nobody did anything .
they did n't cut us off ,
well , i do like all my children ,
i have a recipe that 's pretty good for that .
i , i 've , i have , uh , a low tolerance for that kind of , uh , that kind of person .
hundred miles due east of here .
but , uh , with today 's world and the kids today , uh , there 's no way , i ca n't say that i would just ask someone , you know , that i did n't know like that to baby-sit .
and i think that 's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with , you know .
i had a friend who worked there for a year or so
as it stands now i 've got to do that with a blade .
and then there is wild blackberries there too .
i do n't think , uh , hardly anybody lives there ,
we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks
i am .
young people if they do n't , you know ,
i was in europe .
and i understand , it is too expensive to have two car payments .
uh , i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi- , military off and on over the , over the years of being called back and things of that nature , is , uh , i 've found that , you know , there 's an extraordinary amount of waste .
and so we 've gotten together
i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing
they do have a wing where the people who are really sick , you know --
and he just loves it .
and fact is , we 're going to take a vacation this year .
and , uh , she got home ,
and then there 's other departments --
and i am going into my third year
and then like , the week before that , they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good , bring it in
and , uh , i , you know , i 've read all the consumer reports and things ,
two ,
oh goodness , my mind has gone blank it 's , uh , othello .
i mean , just because their kids had the ability and the , and the drive to do , try and get an education , they did n't send him to a public school , you know ,
oh well he lived through it ,
if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing , especially while you 're waiting before you serve it .
i have to call and get it fixed .
but in general i like to exer- , i , i like dance a lot ,
you know , they ,
i guess the , the big discussion , just kind of what you were mentioning , has been the color .
and that 's really discouraging .
and it was not a happy situation for , for any of them .
i understand they sell it , you know , they sell names because it 's quite profitable to them .
we found them --
and it 's hard to , hard to say whether the , um , risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not ,
i have heard horror stories ,
but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a , like a plate over the top .
a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are , they say oh , i want to be a doctor , i want to be a lawyer .
i , i , well , personally i 've been very diligent --
and then you 'll hear that it , you know , they did n't , um .
we 're from a county , we 're from the county they marched in .
it was , he was supposed to be there at six o'clock , not seven o'clock ,
well , the , um , glass and the newspaper we usually take to walmart .
and i --
i 've , i 've had mixed emotions , i guess , when i listen to , uh , the radio and , and watch t v about the different , uh , things that are happening .
and i do n't , i do n't , you know really see a lot on sale or anything
uh , it 's called the clothes closet ,
and a i got a little bit better ,
a lot of people that i work for are , mothers that stay home .
they call it senior citizen day care .
well , i 've been kind of , been intrigued with the rangers , uh , more so with , uh , uh , their management than anything else .
and then i spend time with them while , you know , he 's doing other stuff .
and i 'm just like , well , uh , i 'm not even going to think much about it --
i do n't know what you call it .
and , you know , the cop 's just got to go back and , and do his thing all over again , because so many of the crimes are , are done by repeat offenders .
it was a magic number for him
we , we 're kind of real , we 're real happy that we do n't have any debt ,
well ,
and our benefits for maternal and , and parental care and even for elderly people --
i mean you take these , you know , most of the people who are committing violent crimes , most of them , not all by any means ,
and so that ended that ,
and so he 's doing his masters here .
-- but that 's the way it goes .
they won in a squeaker .
i mean , i 've heard stories now where the , where the , um , the military is running around ,
-- so i took a pattern off of that ,
uh , her husband just killed her
i did n't know that .
but i do n't like the broncos .
and she said , you know , we , we were going to call you if you had n't called us .
i mean , i 'm living in dallas now .
i meant living in texas ,
i want to go see that .
and he liked them .
we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something .
the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood- , uh , the door frames ,
and i wal- , i mow my own lawn .
but , uh , i think it would be nice
and i was looking for , uh , dependability and something that was going to last a long time . i was g , that i would get a , for the money that i was going to spend , that i would get a return that was , that was worth that money .
so . but , um , that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , for- , that are more , you know , nonessential items .
in the past , um , three years i 've had three different addresses .
take a picnic lunch .
so we , we would always go in for the museums .
well , we do n't either ,
that 's the only thing .
and we ca n't seem to get ours green .
well , my family moved to texas about eight years ago .
and even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in the , the management ladder --
uh , tempe .
and , and i had a high deductible on the on the , uh , on the c- , car insurance
the , the deductibles did n't apply .
so i think , not only does it help my body ,
so , i mean , his appeal was denied
but i could certainly have , uh , three bins out there for , you know , plastic and --
i mean , she cries every day .
so they still had , they had , and they had people who came in who , um , supervised , th- , all these houses ,
they are .
he goes do you want to dance .
and so pretty much now , uh , we do n't use them too much .
and now she 's staying home all the time ,
oh , i still do n't ,
we usually try and drive up there , oh , once every year or two .
uh , uh , uh , recently i , i 've seen , uh , the fisher king .
they ,
so you meet the standards ,
i mean , he , you know , he ca n't field
i , i like it ,
and , and , uh , very windy .
that 's why , i ,
so i 've been thinking , especially now is a good time to buy a car .
and it 's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff , i know .
but they had not ,
he did it again --
uh , i do n't even use a calculator for the stuff i 'm doing because it 's all pretty round numbers .
but texas , uh , adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade .
uh , in fact they have , they have a continuous news station , which is nice if you 're driving and you want to h ,
i guess my , my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six , and then probably seventy-five during the day .
i know one employee ,
well , that might be the difference .
and it was a big car .
w- , we went like twenty or thirty at a time .
he , he 'll come home though , and he 'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds ,
i mean , it was , it was just , an ul , the ultimate party room , you know ,
well , this is , is was a regular , uh , electronics store , you know .
i love pierce anthony novels .
it 's too easy to , to run into the gas station .
but sometimes it sort of gets , gets to me
-- you do not really feel that that really close to them .
but , i used to watch all those exercise programs on t v ,
it just really ,
-- and dick thornburg who 's now the attorney general --
and the only reason i got it was , you know , there was a while --
actually , i did ,
i mean they , they 're in school ,
which is in now .
and nobody had any idea what a liter was ,
-- and , uh , that 's one , and you know , i really like that ,
and if it 's elsewhere , other people come --
i 'm a music major ,
he does n't work out very often .
and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano , you know ,
and , uh , i do n't know , that what they have ,
but , uh , somebody did it , just for your train of thought where they , they showed something
we have wooden floors
in fact , on the news tonight , nolan ryan was on there .
but that leaves me off on holidays and summers .
but i , i enjoy the ,
but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes , uh , a perpetual problem .
it looks like they 're kneading bread .
i come from the east coast
i know , like a week or so ago ,
i mean i picked a primary care physician and just did n't like him , you know .
awakening was , it was kind of sad to me .
and , uh , you know , unfortunately we , we were part of a , of a bigger , bigger company --
and , um , there 's some stuff that 's really for , uh , auto repair .
here if you have an accident and no one 's injured , the police wo n't even show up .
and , uh , i read a lot of non fiction books , too .
or i , i did n't make the jury ,
i have the same situation .
i 've never used those .
and i --
and she would push , you know ,
getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all
you know , like right now , today was in about , you know , the fifties .
but , uh --
so we get away from the , the smog .
my daughter and , and i hate camping so we go shopping .
like , like , uh , i 've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because , they , they really did n't match .
and they just laughed at me .
i think the first thing they said ,
my grandmother actually was in a , a nursing home that , uh ,
-- he 's got a new partner .
i used to go there when i was in college .
fortunately , uh , down where i live in florida , there 's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look .
this is bred for ,
i would not , i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door .
mine has its , see , the handle bars go up and down ,
it 's , it 's not a random --
-- they were all like , uh , like six eight and , uh , you know , six ten ,
so i like to watch that
but --
uh , in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it , he could probably slip
but my wife is usually up then
it 's not firing first .
my father had been in the military .
i love it though .
those big piece of something came flaming , falling out of the roof and landed on the field
and we 're just as happy for her to finish --
uh , i do n't really , i do n't have a family ,
and i , i mow it , uh , you know , with a mulch mower so the , the particles fall down --
and then you patch them up .
they had to do as much as we did .
and , uh , the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman , they expect me to be more motherly ,
and , uh , especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses
i think ten percent ,
that 's a- , --
i work for n i s t .
and we do that with his family about every five years ,
but , i guess this day and age --
-- you know , when you 're sitting there ,
i never been in a bask- , football game in high school that had that many .
i had a dump truck come and dump it .
and it had strawberries , kiwis , and raspberries --
it 's frustrating .
this is college --
-- well , if we 're entertaining we 'll do a chinese recipe --
they 've got a , uh , mountain bike ,
and , and they lead into each other .
and , so he has all the work space he needs .
san francisco ,
uh , she worked a job until we moved to our new house
and they tithe
i do n't get into the --
and i did n't get it done .
well , that 's kind of the way we were doing
and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping .
you know , and i do n't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there .
but , i do n't know what they can do to really prevent it , you know .
i did n't see any boats there , though .
and that i could n't watch ,
i 've never been there .
so i 've had to deal a lot with child care
and he was saying his excuses , if you move her some place else , the people might not be so nice .
that was another funny thing ,
and then friday my husband and i split .
i 'll have to tell my son about that .
i do n't , i do n't know what they can do .
so . and i have n't been back to des moines in a long time .
and i , i --
that 's a ,
and you know , my b m w that my husband was going forty to forty-five miles an hour
but he was with another company before that ,
and you get your gwu- , your gun right then and there .
but again i miss ,
i mean , well , i did n't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent
he 's got a full , a pure bred golden retriever
ever since i was a young and , uh , used to watch the old , uh , apollo missions going off in , uh , classroom t v -s .
and it also teaches them spiritual warfare --
but then there 's a place up the pass , up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some sunday mornings , drive , drive up to , i think it 's about eight thousand foot elevation .
my friend talked me in that .
seattle is only about two and a half hours ,
he 'll be a year old in january .
you may have half literature for the whole year ,
-- but now that i 've broken away from it , i 'm , i 'm glad i have .
and i believe we would have , because god 's really put it in our heart not to get in debt , you know .
when it first happened it was , he was guilty , he was guilty , he was guilty .
and that 's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son ,
it was not real pretty .
i 've never used an i b m actually .
i 'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these , you know , knit these things
and , i want you to know that became the most suspicious , cantankerous , contrary old woman ever walked .
we told them about the stuff
and then i got there and tried to ,
so we have n't got to use it much ,
but it 's always like the second week in september ,
and i love .
like you say coming a little bit further up north .
and he showed me how to use his guns
and , uh , uh , the other one is , uh , uh , her husband is in the m- , navy
and so then i said , i 'm going to move back up there to go to college .
it 's like elijah , or something like that .
i guess it was like eighty-four , eighty-five --
uh , ca n't afford it .
that 's , you know , it 's been four years ago ,
and the , the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much
but , i 'm glad it 's done , because it 's brighter .
and if i can stay up late enough , i like to catch saturday night live every now and then .
i feel like i 've learned a lot about the piano .
i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy ,
and , uh , they can put a ,
we have , uh , some friends who live on the lake --
uh , we went home to visit family .
it is .
uh , i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at t i ,
personally i like to catch large mouth bass --
uh , and , uh , then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time .
i have , i have my doubts , you know .
i 'm going to put wood in there .
there 's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games .
one is already in college in new england ,
uh , well , if we have one murder a year --
he shaved the beard off .
but , uh , i grew up with country and western ,
and i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it .
-- you know , they have that type of music ,
so is mine .
and , uh , the child care center associated with our university was quite good
and no other responsibilities for yourself , i guess , you know , it 's , i can ,
and i have known , you know , people close to me that have been in all three ,
so , uh , the only , we only had one radio station
it 's .
so , that 's one , one way he looked at it .
and almost all the people that i clean for , believe it or not , are mothers that do n't work .
and , uh , now the air force is the largest employer in the , uh , area
but it 's such a grind --
i know a little bit more from a , a co-worker .
then , you know , there 's been guys in jail for six years
and they closed ,
i love to walk --
but i , i think i 'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to , to go have it done now
my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye .
this was last year .
and i do n't really get out a lot to , because my job , to , to exercise .
we , uh , our town did n't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many , many years just because people are , are in the recession
-- uh , i 've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
but , i 've been , i , i 've been away too long .
and when , uh , when come time to get out of school , i thought , boy , i 'd like to teach .
and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties .
but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him --
it 's , it 's a close subject right now .
because it 's not a full two story .
i get free money for thirty days .
i pay i think ,
and when they were coming home i was going to work .
and he got killed .
i 've seen those .
and then , and then , uh , , uh , the blond headed girl that used to be on newhart .
and how they can do it i have no idea .
uh , i do n't even know , to tell you the truth .
and from what i saw the game houston , houston impressed me a lot .
he 'd , he 'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door , if you happened to close it on him or something , you know ,
but they 're suppose to work really well .
we get a mixed league in ,
my involvement has n't been direct
but that goes out with the trash ,
but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks ,
and then when everything 's set up , then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with ,
because , i mean , crawfish , everybody over here likes crawfish
but i- , it 's , it 's at least something .
and the people do n't want to hire people this age any more .
i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass , you know .
-- an awful lot of people know where it is , or have been there .
so we did n't have any lawn and garden type duties .
i have a brother-in-law who is , uh , an ex-college coach and like a pro
he just was beside himself , you know ,
for example , i have a brother in north carolina
i do n't , i do n't have that choice .
i feel like it 's a treat .
and anyway , he just , he went and found this guy in , in dallas somewhere who had picked up one in , i guess in te- , in mexico ,
but when we got hired here , no , no , never any layoffs , never , never ,
and that is really super kind of stuff , too . take , if you like continental at all --
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice .
i always liked that one .
so , i 've been around cars a lot , but , uh , driven a lot of old pontiacs .
but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly .
we , we saw , an , we liked it
they go to our church ,
, uh ,
i 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now , and , and what the amount of material that they do , uh , put into the atmosphere .
so , but he , he 's real unusual in that , uh ,
well , we 've heard bad , we 've heard some bad things about some of those , you know ,
and , uh , he was a little late graduating ,
uh , she 's not here anymore --
and the hours are wonderful
i have one at , uh ,
but , he 's still not back where he was .
but it was , uh , more an impact , i think , on the oldest two .
i had forgotten about that ,
but , it 's been an interesting , uh , roughly , oh , nine months here ,
uh , i guess partly because of our climate .
so we 're in garland .
or you 've had a cold
and , uh , i , i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account
i think my parents took me there when i was real young .
well i know both of my kids did n't want to live anywhere around the , the downtown areas ,
and it 's a public system , however , you 'd think that it was a private school , because i take it , the best teachers and the best students ,
but that was n't it .
i have n't personally ever been tested ,
but i , i think it helps me everyday in trying to review wh- , the state that the world is in and try to guess where we 're going .
still way up north , sort of , um .
it 's like , they 're dark .
well , but that , that stuff is , goes one notch beyond , uh ,
and we did it --
it 's , that was one of the first things i made for my husband , because i was like , um ,
i mean , it 's , like , really humid
and there is a number of questions
uh , on the other hand , you know , i , i had a similar , had a similar health plan
or we eat junk food at home --
oh , that 's my favorite kind to play .
and , uh , less than a week later the arm was broken .
the reality of it is it 's tough .
and then we , you know , we investigated this by flying some people out from dallas to observe some of the schools in california that already had it .
so i 'm very much aware of , uh , crime in the cities and the , and the concern about it .
see , i ca n't even think of who the new orleans quarterback ,
i , i , i do n't , i do n't , i do n't know the law on that
he says , he said , uh , you 're at thirty something ,
but my husband had been ma- , in fact , he 's been , probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time ,
and , uh , we , we 've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the , since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth , toothbrush and what not cleaning up .
and , you know , i 'm a golfer ,
uh , uh , i do n't know , uh .
that would make me happy though .
when you think of some of the best presidents we 've had , in the past , have been people that have struggled to get to the top .
and we have what we call the five b s . uh , th- , for our taxes . booze , uh , butts , cigarettes , beds , uh , hotel room tax --
and i got real involved in many things
and he is tycoon or something .
he does n't like to roll over .
and ,
and , you ca n't find chicken there ,
growing up in oklahoma , there it was always the home team , kind of like dallas is around here .
my husband likes to go out and jog
well i have had clubs for twenty years , you know .
my husband makes those .
just really whatever .
inter- , oh ,
and , and i have spent the last ten , ten years being a florist .
but , enough that , again for anything in the house i could probably ,
well then i can tell you that roles have changed .
we do most of our fishing at night .
you do n't know who you 're going to come across , you know .
there was one guy i use to watch on e s p n ,
-- because it is another language ,
apple 's coming to town
i was going oh , wait a minute .
and you 're just drawn into his , his horror ,
put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display .
um , i think i like ,
well , then , most --
and the guy lives in with her , you know ,
other than that , dances with wolves seems like to be the only thing i 've seen in the past several months to have any ,
i never get it .
what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party
or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth
we live out in the country ,
and , uh --
i 've had him probably five years .
in fact , it even had , had a little refrigerator , uh , and the whole business .
i do n't really have a favorite type .
we live in a kind of small town ,
you know , except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk , i guess , for babies and things
i kind of missed it this year , and felt bad ,
and at the time that i bought this one it was just a , a much better arrangement for me personally .
um , there was a crime here in mckinney ,
my t v viewing started sort of mid-sixties ,
but i figure that 's got to be the story of my life anyway , is making car payments .
so i , i have a rifle in the house .
i forgot
but i have had shrimp .
but it is because we , uh , came to this area about the same time .
so they knew that there was something going on here .
baroque and romantic .
and the weather got warm so quick --
-- my three and a half year old has wanted this ken doll ,
you know , he 's a jazz performer ,
well , i , i live in an apartment building
well , luckily , it has n't gotten that bad here .
utah , i 've had a couple of ,
but one had more blue to it .
for instance , like social security tax or soc- , uh ,
that was great .
she needed to work
but we like l a law .
i 'm much the same way .
her , her one son was watching the soapies
but then i , i foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but , you know ,
and i enjoy reading and playing softball .
and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends ,
i guess , uh , tonight 's topic is about , uh , personal computers and level of interest and , uh , and your , your expertise .
yet , you go out on the streets
and suddenly it , it , it drops off fast ,
for the green card .
so that kind of threw them off .
it 's one of my --
i could stand this all summer .
well i , i know , uh , where i came from . we did n't have a very , uh , rich community
you know , and then , and eduardo mana 's from mexico
and , you know , you can see the three spark plugs there in the front .
and you could just vacuum it up .
i mean i 'm always willing to try anything usually .
i 'm , uh , turning in a capital request right now ,
we 're burning fuel oil and a few other things ,
my mother and father both , uh , uh ,
and what is funny is that you use , uh , bran , all bran --
i do a matter of fact .
and i realize that .
i mean , it was like a necessity .
uh , around here we have a program where , uh , we , we put out the , the , we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers .
-- and she still feels good .
something that 's kind of more of a comedy .
well , you know , in a situation like that , i do n't know if that 's good or bad .
i thought , well , at least he was honest .
s , social changes ,
but like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time .
now i 'm just about , oh , a half hour , uh , north of salt lake .
and that 's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw .
and they would n't have to pay him ,
but it blew a head gasket .
i went to texas tech out in lubbock --
-- and one of these days i am going to do something about that i believe .
but she 's still on her own , i mean .
it was real nice ,
i live in plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which is the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath .
i guess , before i even met her .
but , uh , i missed that one .
but , uh , this , this was actually inner city --
i wanted s- , uh , stick shift . and , so i did n't have a whole lot of choice .
and we went in ,
but that 's the minority .
as i said , i , i subscribe to , uh , to people and to time ,
and she has to be cared for , whatever , she would prefer , and she 's actually said this , to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment , uh , probably with like a living space and a bedroom --
they 're eight and ten .
and we had a small , um , farm house out in castroville which is just , uh , to the west of san antonio --
i also , um , like to participate in , uh , things like ,
-- and it 's uh , it 's everything it 's supposed to be .
well , my husband would n't do that anyway .
and he drags me out every now and then
uh , through my company ,
and then , uh , the new author that came out with , uh , oh , the one that , uh , harrison ford starred in .
we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers .
my family is from kentucky .
i did n't know that .
so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants --
so i finally said , we , i want a really solid car .
and , and , uh , that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that .
well , i mean he 's doing all right , probably .
these were like pretty short , black ,
well we 've got , uh , you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids
because it 's small like that
so he plays that and , and a little bit of piano
because , um , i work so hard over the weekend , doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on monday .
but i do n't know what , whether they 'd have creosote would do anything ,
act- , th- , actually that was just a , at , at the beginning of september
what , what makes me sick is , is when they show the dump sites --
and , uh , they do their , they do a lot of original recordings themselves .
and , you know , various other things ,
uh , my wife and i have a dog that soon be eight years old ,
but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill
not that i know of ,
and i ca n't say that there 's too much of that there .
i have one of them . um ,
and they 're fixing to go to disneyland .
but it never happened ,
like my roommate 's laughing at , you know , at me , you know , because their schooling 's paid for .
well he at least saw it one time .
i do n't know how , how soon they 're going to do it , or how organized it 's going to be ,
you know , i , i 'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor --
that he had stopped writing and had stopped , you know ,
on top of the recreational vehicles .
uh , we 've , we 're right now where if we do n't buy anything extra , we can make it on what my wife makes .
i do ,
well , i kn , i know , i 'm going to school right now ,
some , some of the , uh , the people that are in there are real , you know , very nice and friendly to everybody --
and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your --
and we had a , a wooden ,
it started out just being a terrible place for the people ,
and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school
i , i tend to , uh , i get teased by my family a lot , because , uh , i like experimenting on , on food
so she could find out if she wanted to go .
well , my husband has to take the bus into dallas , and does n't return all day ,
they just expected to go .
and the , uh , teacher becomes a , uh , a sort of a consultant , resource person --
in fact , i was just reading an article ,
inboard outboard .
we have one ugly pine tree .
me , too , because we go all the time ,
oh , well that has n't happened to me yet .
and , uh , he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy
i was personally acquainted with the , uh , people who , uh , ran the nursing home in our little hometown .
but they call them flags up here or down here , down here .
my husband likes sandy patty songs .
because you ca n't see a car ahead of you ,
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction --
we had a lot of bank robberies and different , lot of break ins and stuff .
but i like it .
it was pretty clear here .
and i was working
but , uh , south dakota did n't really have much for ,
like train tr- , train wrecks and things like that , that
-- and they did not know how to take care of that ,
and i left the whole thing
well , even when someone has been convicted
and , and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better .
i mean , they 're not allowed to accept any new inmates .
and they drilled this well
and that helped .
but also , uh , that , that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles .
i 've always liked the new yorker .
-- but , uh , they both went through preschool .
and that 's what made me happy ,
and , and , uh , it 's not too bad around here although you see it , you know , more and more in the sky .
we could use a little more rain ,
you fit it in with all that , that .
and , i often will keep tra- , track of what i 've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook --
so it was n't , you know , she was n't an infant .
but , uh , there 's been movies out that i 've been wanting to see .
it 's been about five minutes .
we would make that sacrifice .
uh , we made a point to spend a lot of quality time
and we says , you know , mom , if you , you know , if you get a , you get better , you 've got to have the care , the doctor insisted on it , you know , if you get better that you could come out .
so , that was kind of funny .
well , i 'm in pennsylvania .
i 'm glad that you 're in the business .
i wanted to get out and see some things .
and , um , i have my mother living with us
but before that , i really , there 's not much time .
and after a year and a half of that i decided i did n't want that either .
the little guy is so cute ,
i had a similar thing , that i 've worked on cars ever since i was , uh , a kid .
uh , but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or , you know , skirts and , uh , pullover sweaters or , uh , you know , little two piece dress suit , suits like ,
and they apparently , uh ,
and i 'm excited about it .
and that 's it .
at , at the t i there , i said is there any area i should avoid .
but , uh , you know , it 's , it 's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it , you know ,
and then when they come out with the new things , you are like , well why did n't you think of that before .
-- and i do n't know how many others are doing that
i 'm , i 'm a single mom ,
as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i 'd be interested in golf .
it was n't a one dayer .
and , uh , we bought , uh , this house about , uh , i do n't know , year and a half ago .
just recently this , uh , black man served nine years was it ,
and i teach in dallas .
and i never did get a security system ,
and i got accepted to college ,
it 's highland park village .
they were standard cadillacs
he said , he said the other night on the news that he had n't done any extra shooting for six weeks ,
you know , like what he said is , you know , a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about , you know , people asking why are you doing this , why are you doing that .
and they would buy a plot of land , and contractors and builders ,
but i do n't .
you know , i 'm kind of like you , maybe one of these days i 'll get around to it ,
that 's mumblex , that 's , that 's , that 's a fun idea i mean if you ever , uh , want something different to try .
it 's a tax on the first dollar earnings ,
and the , the transportation situation is such that , uh , all the car pollution is , is absolutely awful .
they give you , they assign you a topic ,
usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain --
i think it was done by maybe the platters or something .
i enjoy that .
knocked that parakeet right out of the air .
i like her .
and she 's thin
i know that it 's not settled but , there are other areas that we could focus our attention on .
my kids , when they were little they had given me some azaleas --
the house that i used to live in had one bath and a half .
well , she is into a little bit of everything .
then in high school it changed into four levels of , uh , of instruction in the major subjects .
i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me
and then the price of oil had , had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky ,
and that 's one of the areas that she is working on . to have , uh , uh , a day care center for the indiv- , the children of the , of the nurses that are staffing the facility .
first of all , first and foremost the bills games i want to see .
just moved here about , uh , oh , uh , one , about a month ago --
they are , they are , well they are siamese cats ,
my , my daughter is four ,
and then she 's going to have her children ,
somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare
that 's , that 's very handy .
at thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars i 'm paying in taxes ,
i 'm a , uh , uh , talk show person .
and then the second time i was going to do it at richland college ,
texas is too .
so there really was n't a problem that way .
because it 's , like , really flat here .
but i think it 's gone up to fo- , four dollars this year .
okay , let me , let me go back to my , my sister now is in college ,
the series died right after that ,
but now they 're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases .
i thought , well every , all these t i -ers have gone home , uh ,
we 've got some good , um , um , hybrid burpee uh --
it 's a , well actually it 's a mutant .
i 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something ,
but i like , i like mysteries .
i mean the , the counties are much larger .
and even though my , my wife 's insurance covers me ,
on occasion i can wear jeans .
so , i hope so .
so we ca n't , ca n't ever recycle them .
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they 'd seen in twenty years ,
i , and i believe that ,
-- i 'm only up here temporarily on an internship
i , i bought that one ,
well , that 's one of those little , uh , uh , little extras that you do n't see in the , uh , the , the , the handbook , you know .
well , i 'm in texas .
and before then i was from utah .
they live in a small town called david , which is northern panama up near costa rica .
and , uh , most of the cooking i do just comes out of a can .
we did n't sit in front of a t v or --
and i say , boy , you know ,
and then we use , uh , different chemicals and things ,
a lot of my friends are into macintoshes .
he wears his , his brace and his high tops
-- ohio 's a very pretty state .
of , in , in , in an obscure part of the defense department .
well , i , uh , just had a christmas around the world party --
it 's , it 's , it 's very str , strange that i got this call because my wife just called me .
so far i 've been trying to call all day because i keep getting these subjects like capital punishment
so .
i had to get like a first time ,
uh , people form a co-op and , uh , parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours .
one , one of the biggest problems seems to be we do n't , they do n't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled .
i mean , we have two kids , you know , that just love him a lot ,
the monitoring is not that bad , though
and i 've , i 've become i guess more of a country fan over the years .
you know , and that 's kind of like today .
and i would never do that .
i , um --
they had some property there
ours is , too .
uh , i do n't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested .
and , uh , we made that decision
but i was thinking , oh , my gosh , if they had very many babies , they could n't possibly get them all out .
and he said , oh , he says , i think i 'm the guy that , actually , uh , gave it to all my students .
i do n't know which that answer is .
uh --
um , i 've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in , in reading more and , and spending more time at the library
now i 'm a single parent ,
well we have one through work
and she was selling it
and , uh , we are presently , uh , in receipt of a site permit , which will allow us to , um , uh ,
-- and we pulled in just as it hit .
and i traded it in , traded it in on my lincoln
well , i know , i was in atlanta ,
i mean , my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it .
i , i do a lot of chinese cooking myself .
n c state .
it 's a funny degree .
and , uh , now with all this stuff coming out with woodward 's book and everything .
cause this is only my second day doing it
but , ,
well , i have to ,
my wife is not an academic at all .
and i thought , oh , really , here , i 'm really going to get one .
that 's right .
and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things
i went , we went around ,
and , uh , i love seeing the men help the women so much .
but it was n't too long until she , uh , found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning .
well it is not a story ,
we 've been , we 've been , uh , writing a story together .
and we 'll go to the park
but , the only problem was that when they took that one out , the small computer was the i b m p c .
but i am staying in minneapolis for a year
but i could n't ,
but not exactly like ,
they 're not going to recruit me anymore ,
my mother had --
and i ,
most pack- , most software packages will do that for you .
it 's pretty dry .
you listen to him
i 'd like to go back .
and , you know , it 's a little time consuming ,
we also own our own house ,
so they were trying to start that out ,
now how you 'd implement that software wise or mechanically i do n't know ,
well , there , there was not nearly as much of it .
he 'd even tolerate him petting though ,
e- , even though i admire someone who is n't ,
a single person .
and , um , there 's a lot of kids , a lot of kids .
we have family that lives outside of the state
but , uh , but we have really had nice ,
we went , uh , we took the southern route and went , went through , uh , uh , the grand canyon , again
and i would take a ton of them --
and that 's how we learned about it ,
and so i write programs to do little things
so that , that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the , uh , either medicare or insurance to cover it .
and i sell family products .
i , you know , i served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem
she 's my baby ,
but i put it on hot and also melted it .
it 's , um , i think it 's just called texas gardening ,
he is bouncing around ,
when , when i have run and jogged , uh ,
and that worked out great too .
and he baked us , he made a real big cake himself ,
over a very long period of time .
and , um , i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party .
you 're making one more month 's payment every year .
there they 're a singing group here in plano .
-- and they 're just really close here .
we usually do n't go for beef really anymore .
i 've been developing it ,
yo- , we were talking about that just the other day .
and i ca n't really think of any other , um , places .
they weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds .
we wo n't have too much here for another couple of months yet .
i think there 's an eighty percent chance this evening ,
the sherman facility , we are still in the , closer too , but still have a little bit of , um , finalization to do .
and , uh , you go from the , uh , water pump up to the radiator
oh , so did i .
well , i have a smattering of about ten different ones ,
my old t v that i had from college when we got married finally went out
-- they have a teriyaki steak there ,
i did n't , obviously i did n't see the classroom , uh , and , hopefully never will ,
but , uh , you know , the last movies that i 've seen were probably on video .
and they are missionaries there
and everybody is real excited .
they were always kind of ,
i 've never been to texas .
and , and i 've been looking at these , uh , uh , like in home depot where you can go and they 've got , that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the uh , uh , what , the , the , the door .
it looks like it would be , uh , better than having ,
i think , you know , you 're in oak cliff .
and , uh --
he may never have all those motor skills back .
they 've got catalytic converters ,
i 'll have to tune in .
and they 're good for about five years or four years
but , we do get together for wh- , fellowships at our church ,
i thought , okay .
and she said , well , you know , when i was a teenager , that had been ,
and i just think , um , so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a , oh , a big day care
and i have to read the magazines , you know , such as byte , and computer world and mac world and all of these , , uh , magazines such as that ,
and where we are now , what we 're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents .
uh , i bought some cokes the other day in the br- , the little bottles --
or , um , i 'm not sure whether i 've had to return that many things , uh ,
so dogs that get down in the hips ,
well , that 's what i mean ,
but there are oth , are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it does n't do . like you ca n't top stitch with it .
now my son is a national level competitive swimmer --
we take extension cords
but , but it does n't ,
i just never really thought about it
so like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings .
-- and we went up that coastline ,
but ,
i 'm , uh , i 'm a big red sox fan ,
and at the time that i was a teenager , a late teenager i guess , i ca n't remember the year , smoke gets in your eyes became popular .
ther- , is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier
because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts .
it gets them away from home and , and gets them to do something useful ,
i 'm not sure what you do .
and then when it came out , all i heard was just , oh , how bad it was , that i did n't even want to get it .
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer .
but , you know , when you look at the neighborhoods and they 're all brown except the one , you know ,
maybe when the kids get in school that will be , you know ,
and it 's just a paper bag --
so that would be one way of doing it .
well , you know , um , back then what they tried to do , you know ,
so i , i do n't know if that varies from state to state or if it ,
well in your words , --
that 's , that 's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch .
but , uh , then they came off and told us we could n't do it any more .
you would know , the whole world would know what you were facing .
i gre , i grew up in plano --
well , you know , the call for help is what scares me now because it , it just ,
i , i have a good friend who is , uh , a physician practicing in canada .
-- but i was real lucky because it just hit the , um --
i just got married .
but sooner or later i need one .
and it was so humid there that your , um , all your windows were fr- , were wet every morning .
my first , when i first thought of it , i thought it , uh , when they asked the question i thought , well that sounds wonderful .
and --
actually through electronic mail .
and , in fact , he , everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency , who did work back in nineteen eighty-six , who wrote a letter to dr . price in nineteen eighty-seven . and in this letter he praised dr . price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis .
we just lived up there .
it 'll seem the news , the harold taft , you know , on the local news .
well , they do the , all the testing that we have to do through the government ,
and it did n't get as , you know , as good a reviews as like the little mermaid , their last one , and got all kinds of academy awards and things last year .
well , i have n't work on them myself so i do n't , that , you know , my cars do n't go to the shop , you know ,
and it 's fun to , uh ,
i have n't done much in , in bulbs .
uh , we have a budget , um --
but , um , oh , he just left for the doctor again
but about the fourth day , i thought , if i do n't get a hot tub and --
i enjoy , um , you know , just ,
and then i 'll respond .
i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids ,
it was --
it stayed pretty , pretty green throughout the winter ,
i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other .
she still likes her piano --
and they 're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off .
and i would love to see what it looks like .
it was on , uh , new year 's day .
it 's shorts but it looks like a skirt .
he lives in wichita , kansas ,
and . there 's going to a special this week .
oh , my , my husband 's always wanted a chow
but i did n't get that one ,
but it do , it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff ,
we both do .
and it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to frederick , but as it does to go to the , the ballpark in me- , in , uh , baltimore .
and , uh , i ca n't remember the size of the engine
-- and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently .
and then --
so , i know that 's my personal viewpoint of things .
i would hate to have lived so long .
that was with richard dreyfuss .
-- and , uh , that 's when you really start getting into speed . you know ,
but i ca n't give a shot .
and he 's concerned about it but ,
but , uh , we had the , we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning .
he said , of course i love cats .
you know , because they were from alabama where it never snowed --
but , um , i do n't know do you like ,
i did , too .
uh , i keep track of an inventory here .
it 's totally women .
uh , a good source of information i 've found has always been these , uh , used car manuals --
and , and they 'll wear them .
and uh , they all seem to congregate in celinas , not so much here in monterrey .
i kind of like that , too ,
uh , well , it 's , it 's , uh , in terms of north , south i would say it 's , uh , a little , a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it .
i think i am getting a call coming in .
and i went to a small private school ,
and something ,
i know that , uh , i 've heard people say that you know when people that went to world war two
and actually the other funny thing is that i 'm , i 'm jewish .
i 've had that happen ,
i 'm , i do n't know the exact figure
uh , being an engineer now , i believe in it even more strongly than i did before .
and he said is there any place you would n't go by yourself .
and people really like my lasagna --
we had a cat mumblex that had kittens .
and in my previous job , i really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where i could go and i could work , uh , nine hour days and have like friday only work four hours --
we just did n't do any of the sheetrock wall work
-- um , it 's really nice .
-- so . uh , i was wondering too , if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases --
i , when i was single --
it was boneless --
-- somebody 's trying to cut in on my line
they , they do that on the truck .
i know where my son works they have , uh , an option right now where they can have their own physician
and , um , but ours is about ,
and if you do it ,
well , i felt , um , i feel like i could myself , do some things but , that i have enough responsibility that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home , and my husband , that 's willing to do it , i go ahead and let them do it .
i 'm not kidding .
and , uh , then the end of october it started rain almost a week without stopping , just pouring down , you know .
and she was the one that was intimidated then .
it 's not a lot ,
uh , i rented an i b m selectric .
i never thought about that , you know .
i read that half where she was in her later years ,
uh , it really is .
and there were a couple others that i just have n't had the time .
so we were paying like twice .
i 'll go through and read it .
you know , and if you 've got , if you 've got a pretty good --
and there 's a flash flood watch and ,
but now i could not move back home .
well , i guess i 've been kind of off and on
uh , i have been thinking of changing , uh ,
but we do have a dog ,
i kind of like college actually .
and ,
i , i 've had friends who had them ,
and that 's the ,
no benefits , you know . um .
i ha- , feel that it 's a problem also ,
he 's , he 's just about a year old himself and never had really ,
i 'm a nurse
it 's rained mumblex .
well , they , they really ca n't fire you without cause ,
or , um , like we , i mean we 've had those discussions , you know , about should we put her in or because she 's pretty senile
so we have quite a bit between us and there .
-- and then you take it back to the store
and you take their leftover medicine ,
wednesdays i , i go to church choir ,
and , um , the closer you get to washingt- , d c the more expensive it is .
and so it 's , uh , quite the opposite ,
and i miss that .
she 's only nine months old .
i , they say , you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking .
because i finally asked because , you know , we had all of those milk cartons
um , this is very frightening in that , uh , oh ,
and she told me
and ,
well , the one john works for seems to have a l- , you know , good benefits ,
we painted every room in this house , some of them like two , three times .
my husband is into cycling .
that 's the only one i 've got now for this area .
i did n't think it was too long at all .
it just takes a very long time
well there 's still a lot of dollar five places here
but , uh ,
so they do force them ,
i mean , we 're alerted to what the moment we see something .
i , i did n't have a lot of ,
they were just getting out with the , you know , the disks and all that , getting away with the cards ,
i think he only had like eightch- , eight points --
well , murder , she wrote comes on opposite of that ,
my children had a , uh , real culture shock , uh , when we lived in plano ,
just like this town is too small for me ,
when i started out with my mother-in-law , because she was in there first , i --
i had a friend who was in this
you know , as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers .
we , i guess we , we use the coupons , too .
we have got a lot of those .
and it goes into the full gamut of gardening . you know , everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to , uh , how to prune .
the way engineering people do is they ,
so , in order to have a reason for being there , especially as they got older , i became involved in it too
it was really funny .
and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really ca n't quite understand what is that other people take for granted ,
i 'm certainly acquainted with the character --
-- and then for the saturday night dinner they bring in like kentucky fried chicken from durant ,
i mean , i know i need to do more .
and a whole roof of a restaurant came off .
but that works out nice because we get paid every week
you set your brake .
i guess that 's what i , i hope for them .
i knew ,
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date
well , i guess it was a , uh , a very successful movie financially ,
uh , it was sweeper college of about seven hundred and fifty students .
we 've been waiting for a , a good movie out this summer for the kids to see .
and things were n't okay .
i live right near white rock lake ,
now we would n't have that problem , because we 're not vegetarians .
you can put , put out certain types of plastic material
we went to , i 've forgotten , one of the paint stores
and , you know , i 've , i 've in the past i 've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and looked at it some months later i 'd find something drastically wrong with it ,
but she does her nails .
and she laughed
right in the , in the lukewarm milk .
and it 's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to . like you mentioned
i mean , here in dallas everything is just real rush , rush .
and the phone ringing bothers me ,
and it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment --
course in our particular state , uh , we have the prison overcrowding , whatever ,
but it 's just two stories .
and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know .
so i really , we 've lost , you know ,
but , uh , still i , i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to , uh , really do a bang-up job ,
the question now to ask , is it difficult to find time ,
green spiky leaves .
and we just ,
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all .
well , this machine does it all in one step .
-- so we 're kind of running the gamut .
she 's not going to do it ,
um , as far as the new hires , i , i hired on just early enough that i , i missed it . um , where the new hires were concerned
i do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go
she says that when her husband died that he said , oh , that my uncle had said that he would never ha- , put her in a rest home .
um , last , like a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer
he 's been in the paper , in jail ,
the first one , they started them indoors this time .
but , uh ,
and i 've got , you know ,
and , uh , she would do that if , if we did n't tell her that she 'd better not .
and the reason i like it so much is because i 'm essentially playing against myself .
i , i do n't want to , i want to chew up the whole line here .
and to me , i like that , i guess , too , although there are people ,
cheap taste , cheap taste in cars , okay .
so and i 'm in my twenties ,
course it does n't always work out in their favor .
-- so i 'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather .
i know that .
and it 's , it 's a pretty nice setup . um ,
and the blue , even so many years , two years later or so it does n't match ,
i got taken on some fire- , on firewood .
and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions .
and ,
we 're going to talk about the public school system ,
what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it
i , i travel quite a bit in my --
so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated ,
it 's just a strange landscape ,
but we take her to just about every movie ,
of course , i do not have much to compare it to .
and then , in the paper said it
it really is .
-- and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck ,
i 'm not that familiar .
we do n't have any grandchildren yet .
this is one that 's , uh , the baker family reunion --
in certain crimes .
you know --
that 's the way i am .
and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable .
but maybe something like a nissan sentra .
and she lives with my aunt and uncle ,
because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that , uh , trash , uh , the telephone books are the type of thing that do n't break down over a long period of time .
and it talks about how , you know , if we could just all get toge- , you know ,
and now , they ca n't find them
somewhere in china somewhere i think that it was filmed .
-- so i really do n't like the drive-thrus that much .
it 's like five dollars admission per child , all day .
now it 's even , it 's even higher in dallas county ,
but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then ,
and , uh , and i always pay them off totally every month .
i have , i put some , put in some , uh , an antenna , a really good antenna
and , and , uh , he was , it was fun to work with him .
but if i had to pick one , i would probably pick sam huff , as a matter of fact .
but some family things changed
and yeah , and my nephew is two , almost two ,
and that 's something i like , too ,
i , i 've , i enjoy ,
and we moved once a year usually .
it 's a very clean , uh , fire extinguisher ,
and , you know , and then to go into baltimore , i mean , it well , it 's fewer miles ,
they cover , uh , just about everything , vision , dental , medical --
and , uh , i 've also never been a victim although i have some , i have two friends whose wives were murdered
oh , one of my instructors , uh , said that they were doing something like this
that 's something i do
we live , also live in the city now , actually in manhattan .
that 's , that 's one of , i think , the hard things right now ,
and , um , we also , we , um , we have a , a u s air and visa card .
and there 's one t a for the whole class .
and it took us all of twelve hours .
well , i know that russia , they 're , they 're comparably more , better educated than we are ,
i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot ,
paul hogan .
um , i had been doing a lot of crocheting .
uh , i , i know my friend is , uh , really into guns
virginia .
and , uh ,
and , um ,
and they had already told me , we located one at town north .
finally , it 's my first summer movie .
well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it ,
ac- , actually it 's done , uh ,
uh , i live down in the south western part of blacksburg .
and you can haul things
i think i 've heard summer of sixty-nine .
and we went up to the --
pretty much ,
we 've got stock purchase program and a ,
well our daughter and son-in-law moved up , back up here . he 's from texas , but course she 's from here , uh , about a year and a half ago ,
the river walk .
and i would n't enjoy it .
washington , it really is a , uh , uh , an international city , where baltimore is hometown baltimore .
most of the time , uh , if we catch something , we 'll take it home and eat it .
and , uh , the baby just screams .
but , uh , as you know p c -s change quite rapidly
cambodians , uh , asians , vietnamese .
um , it 's just not in the cards for me right now
but it 's like , uh , i just do n't want to do it ,
well , i noticed that , my kids are , uh , older now ,
they do n't ,
you know , is n't that funny , uh , because the same thing happened to us , except i was twelve .
but , it , it keeps us supported temporarily ,
oh --
there was no one there ,
-- so it depends on your destination , too .
and right now i 'm reading , um , judith viorst 's book called necessary losses , where she talks about different losses that we 've had in our lives that we have to get past if we 're going to mature and --
and i just , i do not like it .
they were pretty much in good taste ,
and i have done that before , but it has always had to be late at night --
i , i read that recently somewhere ,
a six person jury could have decided either way , of course .
so i know what you 're talking about .
i was telling a friend of mine that i 'd be almo- , almost as bad as being an alcoholic ,
but there , there 's no hold outs .
but , the homeowner ca n't be touched .
it would be more a tarp , uh --
because i used to live in , uh , massachusetts ,
but i just do n't like those nine hundred numbers .
at one time i just sat here and thought , well , how can anybody believe that
so i 'm very limited what i do .
you know , they , they support drug habits with , uh , with , uh , you know , with things like , uh , you know , burglary or , or prostitution or stuff like that ,
in allendale .
and i just assumed that it would have been .
i found about it on the network .
that 's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good , oh , long-range planning budget mode .
and it , uh ,
so we , we often sit around and say , what movies should we rent ?
i kind of try to judge from day to day .
uh , work ,
but i 'm always aware of what 's going on like that --
that 's the one drawback .
and then , um , whether , you know , they 're a foreign author or whatever , um , or if it 's their style or , or just understanding the material .
and by the same token , my wife 's mother is now moved into a nursing home ,
um , well , uh , richardson 's a suburb of dallas .
on that order .
but , it 's a knitting one .
well it 's just a very basic life
thing about the credit union is , it 's , the way it 's set up is if you have two thousand dollars left , let 's say , on , on the loan .
but it 's the po- , the music i enjoy the most .
and when you mentioned that , we , we have friends who have children there who just love it .
i , i want to see , uh , dances with wolves .
i talked to people from , well , c- , what , carolina now --
now , i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs ,
i
but , uh , if you want to take them all to one place , they have , uh , the first saturday of every month , they have certain places that you can drop them off .
but that was fairly interesting .
the only pet that i 've had , uh ,
well , uh , as far as t i is concerned , i 'm not sure .
and you know , they 've got a lot of the tools to do it ,
i guess it worries me about jogging it 's that i hear that it 's very hard on your body and , and that , you know , you can end up getting hurt ,
it would have slept three adults anyway .
and , you know , she 's always telling him , is n't there something that , that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray , you know , out in the , out in the field , that you can get rid of ,
and saint louis was much the same .
and then they have another one the same size .
mumblex hope some of the local ,
you have to save all your vacation time
so that 's fine .
well , that and that ,
when i do recipes i just throw stuff in .
and then you have a little picture of them
and then he calls us ,
i mean , we had it for course credit ,
and they ,
-- and so like you were paying for it ,
i mean --
oh , i know that there 's several people i 've talked to that really have a problem with it
i personally would not want to go
i do n't know what the chains are down there . maybe in the mall family book store , something like that .
it was ,
i , i work in waco at a t v station .
and so --
and i always go and do an education things .
but i like dogs
but i do n't know whether to trust that or not ,
and , and she 's involved with , uh , oh ,
right now we got a project going where we 're trying to put , uh , all my wife 's stray recipes on the disk .
and i 'd have to live with that .
you know , and also , the whole , whole thing with noise .
i could almost just watch the wa- ,
and my cousin lives in paris
but they can , uh , of course ,
seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or , or , like i say , drug related .
i lived in the suburbs of saint louis ,
and one of them that , that i 'd remembered was , uh , some , uh , sausage hors d'oeuvres
and , you know , if something goes wrong with it within the first year we 've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer 's guarantee .
it 's silver , silver and yellow ,
i use them so that i build up a credit rating , you know .
and it looked , you know , just like it , it had been there all the time .
i just saw the latest one .
so we were right on the lake .
and so , and , and my boss has , has gone for about like three times , i think .
his grandmother too and they 're , that hi- , her son , his uncle , whatever , you know , anyway .
or there was some other ,
see we do n't have anything here in belton .
and these people are the same as you are .
the great communicator ,
and , uh , it was a eerie , uh , a real eerie blue-green color .
i do n't either .
and they did n't work --
and how they 've had to , how it 's more expensive and things .
they can just subtract it from your bill ,
and when we buy the soda when it 's on sale for ninety-nine cents ,
and it was dirty , um , type of dust ,
so , you are kind of ,
and , uh , i have other friends .
his latest book , and i ca n't recall the name of it , is just excellent ,
and then , uh , who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into ,
and so we 've got a lot of , uh , m i t graduates that are in there
it was ridiculous .
whenever i was coming up and everything
areas , the smoking area , you know , it 's closed in ,
and ,
so i do admire that , but i have n't really put , uh , too much energy into it .
well , we 've been real lucky that ,
but they had live crawfish ,
and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth ,
i know some people who have twenty-five years and thirty and they want more
i do n't think she ever wears slacks --
we bought , when we first married , we bought one on our t v
she 's a nurse in san antonio --
and i , you know , i would love to , to be able to read more because i , i enjoy it so much .
but i did n't realize that our garbage is n't being decomposed .
my husband 's grandparents have a dog
and they 're , they were doing it at their own costs .
and i know that .
he says , looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there .
well , for example . in greek there are seven different words for love .
but then on the other extreme i like to read , uh , uh , i guess ho , i do n't know , horror , steven king type books .
that 's , that 's just it .
but that , you know , we have been thinking about that ,
i 've , uh , you know , i 've helped out extremely , uh ,
but , uh , and then there 's a new sitcom on that is , tim allen 's , uh , what is it , uh , handyman .
i do three hundred sit ups a day now , but not at that , in the morning ,
but , um , otherwise , i 'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here .
it 's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games .
we , we build , uh , laptop and notebook computers here in temple also .
and i mean , the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of band-aids and an eraser and things ,
i just receive them .
well , i found --
and it worked out well .
and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do .
when this subject was mentioned to us i said , well ,
but , uh , there 's a four o one k plan --
saturns , you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to a , a saturn dealer .
and there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama
um , the one my grandmother 's in is very , um , hospital like .
but those are my criteria ,
the first ones i saw they had , um , a man on who was , uh , he played college football and almost went pro ,
it 's a lot of fun .
um , i , i have very mixed feelings about it .
so , --
and it never did , never did run right again .
i mean , i was watching a thing last night , up in washington state .
and mine are two and nine months ,
or if they do n't have that , uh ,
and then you saw , uh , hundred thousand dollar cars ,
they 're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this .
just a couple .
ask them what they have ,
you know , they get tons of magazines it seems --
and , uh , fortunately , we agreed , you know , on exactly , you know , what we thought should be done .
we 're , i happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students
and while he was there , he caught some kind of a strange disease .
we pay five percent sales tax ,
and i thought , oh , my .
i like the group .
my sister was here recently from connecticut
different places every year .
i would love to live up there .
-- and even though they may break it up into smaller groups penn is known for having --
but it 's , that 's just what it is .
i do n't know what that is ,
so that 's not going to work . at least not now .
my in- , families was up in maryland --
and it started raining really heavy
but we do have some blackberry bushes .
so i , i , i 'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking , and , and so forth .
and we 've had to get out and treat our lawn for that .
i 'm no help on that , then . because ,
i , like i say , i 'm a former drug user ,
and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a , a phone number to respond to
like i said , i did n't notice it till then .
and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in south dallas
the thing , the thing that , that , that i saw was okay ,
but i do n't think there 's an escape from light jackets .
and then , you know , arrangements are made like during the summer for you know , um , food and who 's , who 's staying where , because a lot of people fro- , are from down here , in texas .
and , uh , usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up ,
people who buy motorcycles for transportation i think are kidding themselves .
and , i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want , you know .
so , uh , it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date , you know --
but it ended up being kind of nice because you 're not accountable to anyone .
so i get cash .
exactly .
that 's certainly where her roots are .
they 're not nearly as selective as they used to be .
like the census bureau , united states census bureau .
or what 's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired .
and i 'm kind of i- , in favor of capital punishment also .
and , uh , you know , having gone to the university of minnesota , i know what a big university is like .
down here it 's like two hundred dollars a day .
and when we broke things off ,
iowa and nebraska .
but , uh , yours to disneyworld sounds a little bit better .
our favorite is something called white half runner green beans ,
we , uh , she goes more often than i .
i know it .
uh , they , they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence ,
one is now a senior in high school and the other 's in college ,
but i do n't have one at home .
-- and th- , it was your father 's
i 'm not really sure but , what uh , th- , the gun laws in p- , pennsylvania are like .
it depends on what issue you 're talking about .
i mean , the , the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population .
years ago t i sent me to their , uh , computer school down in austin .
i mean , i think my children learned the metric system ,
i mean , she tr- , she had , she had children all across the united states --
and one 's like fifteen by four .
and , and then i 'd have probably rolled it on .
their employees earn almost nothing .
i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me ,
but in the summer , like right now , my mom , well , like she does n't let us watch t v until like eight o'clock at night , you know ,
i do n't play it that much any more ,
just when i get some spare time here and there i 'll work on it ,
and the other thing , too , is , you know , between here and el paso 's , what , five hundred miles ,
and i noticed i was spending less and less time with them
and i work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where i do n't have i do n't have the family time .
i mean the book is , is chilling .
and the city had a very low tax base so they did n't have a lot --
and i , uh , --
and i think gosh , do i want him to go
i 'm wondering with the boom down here .
um , i do n't like the politics surrounding the program though ,
but that 's nice to have
and we go , and we fish ,
-- you know , we eat it , we ,
went to alcatraz .
or , as i say , th- , i prefer the light movies that , uh ,
and if we did have a , a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there .
and they were really good ,
we used --
after my master 's .
you know , i 've , i 've just never spent any time watching it
well , the boys think it 's fun , plus you get your exercise
but i had n't had to sit down and , and well , what do i think about it .
and that 's one of the reasons where i , why i try and get as many sources as possible ,
like i say , by the time i read the newspaper it 's the , the it 's that morning 's news from the day before
i was thinking primarily criminal cases .
um , if it was formal i 'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something .
my sister used to live there .
and he 's terribly rich by now .
but see , i do n't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway .
it gives a very delicious taste .
well i 'm one of those rare guys , who , i , i rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event , um , if ever watch one .
and i do n't know quite how to do it .
i just , i enjoy it ,
and i really hate that .
and we could , uh , read the things in the history books and understand what they said , when it was like , we need food , we need to raise food quickly --
and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high ,
actually , they say that when the house is , uh , fifteen , it 's already old ,
and i know , uh , one has gone to a , well , two of them have gone to preschool .
i have .
and they did n't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors ,
i 've also always thought about the idea , you know , most sports , you know , which are the n r a and people have their thing , you know ,
it may be arrogant ,
um , and they , they do a lot of volunteer work
when i , when i went away to school , i 'm trying to think my criteria .
an we , um , have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids .
mostly my one sister uses hers for her children .
i , i believe in paying my share ,
but then um a friend of mine 's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term .
but , uh , i had a coin shop ,
-- i need to get started on that .
and dan was a drummer ,
i mean , we do it to a point
but he wo n't pull them .
i , i have seen things i really like ,
so , course , i was real familiar with the utah jazz ,
but she went to erie , to gannan university . uh , or gannan college ,
we 'll start them inside
a new car payment .
well , i actually got to go see them win in the super bowl when they went down to new orleans .
i mean , when i had , uh ,
well , i , i know a lot of people ,
there was nothing to it .
i said , oh no , here we are .
i work for texas instruments .
and , uh , he checked body fat content --
so they like that .
i , i mean , i just really could n't look at anything else .
i mean , a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been , have been , in the past , uh , have been not taxed because there 's been such a large lobby against them , against --
and , uh , i 'll call later ,
but , i , uh , i do telemarketing ,
and very often the artist will have a d- , an album
so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a c d or not in the stereo system
but i just seem to , to miss a lot of these programs .
and i guess we had most of it done
uh , in my old age i 'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school
and so , w- , w- , you know , what we do to make contributions so that , basically , we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems , uh , that , uh , scrub out the , n o x and , uh , v o c 's and , and ammonia compounds , uh , like all the acids , to a certain level .
and it would be just ,
-- and i , and i guess control my irons , better , you know ,
anyway , but the car that the muffler people had , um , my , at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further , you know ,
well , the last movie i saw , but it was n't my choice , was the ninja turtle movie .
and she was fine ,
if , uh , if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed , the e- , the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it does n't come through the , so it does n't go , it does n't go through the , you know , into the inside .
he likes to help me design , um , you know , projects that are ,
they do n't have to submit to drug testing like , like they do here in the states and some places abroad .
i think it 's still the new york yankees , you know ,
so i have n't kept track of it .
but you make it in strips .
i , i saw , that , too .
the guy came after him with that big knife .
it 's like brash metal , which all they do is like , they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar ,
it was , it was super ,
and like i say we have n't been real consistent with it .
uh , well , i like all kinds , uh ,
but , we 've , uh , we 've done , uh , many types of camping .
so they each have their own account .
it 's a two story .
the people that we have that do n't come are out el paso way --
it 's interesting we got this topic because i , i , i do n't know what i marked off to get this ,
and we make real simple things , you know , those , oh ,
i think it 's , uh , really neat to see and all that educated minority , uh , person --
so it 's not been bad at all .
well , actually , it 's been warm ,
but when you get into some of these , some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait .
and then , uh , it , it 's , it appeared that maybe it probably was n't the neighbor .
and my son will be in next year
she gave her no time in jail , you know , all of these things
it 's real entertaining for her .
i do .
i would say she was five to eight years old --
and i left at halftime --
we live in a college town
so any how , occasionally i find them in the flower beds .
i 've had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall ,
it 's not always classical as , you know , the official , uh , word might go ,
uh , that 's my other complaint .
and , uh , i guess my third consideration would be , uh ,
and she just , you know , thinks it 's great .
um , well , they have some watches that look really nice .
you know , i 'm ,
so we started collecting them ,
he , he 'd , we 'd gotten a couple of books
so we kind of met halfway --
i have n't quite adjusted , you know ?
and a book called job cues , gender cues , which explains , uh , how certain professions and vocations get , uh , flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other ,
we 've tried it ,
-- but they would take a credit card .
it says something like , if people were to give five ,
and they are not allowed ,
she 's four --
a , a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed ,
once you 've made a decision that way , it 's a little difficult to go back on it .
him and franco harris ,
heavy involvement from the public .
i have a , a tape collection that i like to listen to , uh , cassette tapes --
but i 've been at companies where , uh , you know , the , deci- , the , the trend is , or the definite mood is , well we made conscious decisions not to have children .
and they have , we have thirteen grand ,
i do n't know how many people are , uh , getting involved in this
but , he 's got a , quite a collection of those .
and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work .
a woman was raped in richardson , i read in the paper oh , about a two weeks ago now .
see as much as --
but that , that 's what it seems like , ten o'clock at night .
well without even any question ,
uh , we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money . uh --
and , uh , but , uh , the cousins are closer to our daughter 's age , and , than to our son 's and just totally different ,
so , uh ,
but , i mean , we were going to the doctor once a week ,
and it was terrible .
and so consequently we wind up , wound up playing a lot of classical music there
then i did n't notice any improvement till the , after the sixth one .
and the whole thing would be full of water .
well that i would n't know
i read , i read the newspapers sometimes --
um , they , they made a couple of those , uh ,
mumblex more or less alike the , the , uh , chevrolet
i did n't hurt it too bad .
and he was in combat .
but i , i sure am scared of them giants .
then there 's other times that , you know , maybe the prescription would n't cost more than like seven or eight dollars
i , i feel like i 'm a little bit too , uh , much of a city , city mouse to try doing it .
i ,
and i forgot about the one in the chamber .
and their program they had , i do n't think had a lot of , uh , problems associated with it ,
that 's , around here in a lot of places that 's the way it is --
but yet most of the problems we hear ,
and , and she 's having ,
people are , have got their gardens in , a lot of them now .
i do n't know what he 's going to be in austin .
but i 'm going to school , uh , for legal assistant
and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that ,
because i started to say , you can , there 's different times they say it 's okay to do it .
well , when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork and spent the night there with a friend in portsmith and then went to williamsburg and spent a night .
and they pushed it back , to playing it in the theaters until like august ,
but what was happening at t i is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse . um , mainly the areas whe , where they were doing a lot of , um , manufacturing type things
and , you know , and then they 'll leave ,
and i will let him watch the t v when i am wanting to get my house work done .
first at eight , i think we had
i finished with a two five ,
man , we get the best strawberries , that you just ca n't believe .
did n't want to cook .
and so we will just have to see how things work out .
and , uh , they , basically , uh , did the same exact thing .
they just get bugs in them .
i 'm in favor of it .
and , uh , our youngest is , uh , expecting her first baby .
taxachusetts
i mean it says just keep on until
so we go visit both sets of grandparents and , and take car trips .
i 'm s- , i should n't probably say control .
i really like it .
and i wish i did n't .
but , you know , it 's in the bleachers , way out in the , you know , in center field ,
well , uh ,
and people are looking for alternate ways of , uh ,
and i s , no .
there 's a very large , uh , or very high percentage of car theft .
actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit ,
but i just , i do n't demand a lot for myself
my husband has been one for , oh , just over a year now .
and it varies like every day . i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next .
if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night .
and , i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and , and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful
and i think that , you know , we 're really satisfied with that choice ,
so they have big variety .
i 'm from atlanta .
-- and we have a powerful computer down at work .
they thought that was big news .
it 'll automatically do that for you .
but you know , like in minnesota , they 've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles .
and he 's like glued at the t v .
i 'm twenty-nine .
but just like me , i always think well , you know , these things must be safe ,
and like the man from snowy river , we have , oh ,
i think it was originally scheduled for february ,
but , one , and , and she visited us here in , in dallas .
not at all .
i also have a part time job at a law firm
it does , considering that , you know , you- , uh , house payments are ,
he better not be mine .
repossessed .
and , and they said it starred , um , meryl streep and mel brooks ,
we 're talking about what they , what they call hard rock .
i love those movies .
and the children are left without either parent .
and we have a daughter ,
if it 's life and a day , then he 's not eligible for parole .
oh , well , i 'm not an expert ,
but , uh , uh , they have a tail race over in lake lavon --
and that way we 're not really missing any thing out , you know ,
and they see all their friends and neighbors , uh ,
it 's about why there are n't more people that are voting and participating in ...
-- so we need a car that 's big enough for six .
i , i have totally , totally a tin ear --
and they failed individually ,
i 'm going to have to think of that .
i 'd have to basically say my birth .
and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it , it 's not a terrent , a deterrent , because it 's not .
but no ,
and it would take a hit fairly well ,
we really do n't watch , i think , as much t v as a lot of people .
i really do enjoy that .
well he was in , he was in the same center for two years ,
and there 's other times when i just get tired of it
and they showed all five in a row .
so there was always , there was never just one alone , you know .
and , and i said , well , you know , that was okay .
kind of strange .
because we have a lot of flying with continental --
and ,
so , uh , we play that a lot of them ,
i was trying to think of some while , while it was , uh , talking about it ,
she had many sisters ,
i do n't know how , she 's moved away . i do n't know how it is now
i enjoy it a lot .
and they 're mad at the world ,
and it 's , the , the , the , the , the mumblex cri- , i think that 's the , the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they 're , they 're patrol , the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done , oh , heinous things from calli- , from killing police officers to , i mean just multiple , you know , mo- , molestations to murders of children , just , you know , really bad things
but the program , you know , was still fairly new .
like i have , uh , yellow ones ,
and so those papers really ,
ours start at twelve
there was , in the middle of the back of it , there was ,
but if you paid in more than you actually used , and the same thing for insurance , what you predict your going to be paying for insurance , as long as you pay , actually pay out that amount of money , you 're okay .
and they all kind of met at a central place .
and it 's really fast paced and intense .
and you take , um , s- , little bit , maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr , in a big frying pan . and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt ,
to answer your questions earlier , yes , i , we do enjoy fishing ,
and we live , we lived in ohio prior to this .
i hope that works out well .
they show up and all their kids .
we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan .
i just ended up using it .
we do n't use the radio as a wake up ,
and that was the envelope system .
and her , her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution .
and i 've found excuses , uh --
and the first thing the , the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said , uh , i 've got , i 've got a dozen different varieties
it was almost like a , a pre-aids scare kind of thing .
and , you know , it has a second-hand that goes around .
we traded his pistol for that shotgun .
so that makes a difference .
when i became pregnant i also got meningitis ,
and i could n't get around and was n't able to do some things
today we just had a lot of rain .
and , uh , but i , i do like having them there .
pu- , well we put some papers on the floor ,
i mean it 's a lot of work to see that she 's prepared
and i mean i was out of school .
-- every year .
if i were ,
i do n't need them yet .
i have n't been on vacation in a while either .
and my husband talked to the people in utah ,
but you wait until they go and get a car , insurance , that 's when they get expensive .
and he had an absolutely marvelous time --
that 's pretty good .
yet .
and it 's funny ,
i , i do n't care to support them .
and we never did go out again
but , i 'm concerned about the killing that went on there , because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it , than that ,
well , like --
corpus , you get that humid salty feeling in the air .
they 've , um , they 've had police officers come in --
that was --
if you park in the lot across the street from the stadium , it 's four bucks .
i 've just never really gotten into that .
and , uh --
well , i love to swim ,
and all different types would go in there
and , uh , i would ,
and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree
we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought , who 'd want to eat that stuff .
actually i just joined , um , the appalachian trail walking club , or whatever they call it ,
right now i just lift , uh , weights and do push ups and sit ups --
because we do n't miss it ,
so we both have our expertise side .
but , uh , nevertheless retired .
uh , whe , you know , when they were coming up , i , i did n't sew ,
the one i use , uh , of course , for mostly , only for business purposes is , uh , you know , american express .
but they , they really do ,
well , i , i come from a large family
but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers ,
uh , but , you know . we really need the rain that we 've been getting ,
thatcher ,
that was my weakness .
but i can remember this , the song .
just , just within the last three weeks .
she 's not involved in that , that case .
fast breaks and things and ,
oh , they came from a broken family --
and my office is a small office
and there 's always a few people in the family that , when they stare at it , you know , they 're totally turned off to everything else .
um , but it 's so long ,
so they could put this sign out front that said , you know , thirty-nine cents a liter .
i 've , i 've talked to some who 's really had some bad experience
i like , i liked it because i want to ,
and , um , and they live in an apartment complex
and by the time i 've got everything else ready , the chicken 's re , chicken 's done .
it 's , um , it 's funny ,
they , in essence , have gotten around it by , by listing , uh , decimal inches .
i 'm from new jersey originally .
they did n't call them closets .
so i think that 's what they did at first ,
that 's why i was in the deseg down here in plano also .
but they just have different words --
i mean he 's always , you know , he really does have a good home .
i mean , you know ,
my only craft work is kind of like computers and , you know , go off to the little computer club meetings ,
and , uh , a lot of them had been , you know .
and you walk down in a dome , a glass dome ,
and that 's , that 's pretty good quality time ,
and the only way you 're going to have a view of is this big brick wall , um ,
in fact , i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on t v ,
they 're just too weird to work on now .
and so this is our , our fifth year in it i guess ,
uh , it 's hard for me to tell , because i have n't rented in , uh , probably twenty , twenty-five years --
well i go to saint louis from time to time
it 's not as comfortable a living for me .
and it is very very flexible .
i thought that they .
i know it 's hard to prove rape and whatnot
this is hank williams --
acoustics .
but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people wil ,
but , uh , you know , i , the thing is if , if i catch the news all the time , it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news .
-- but , um , i figure , you know , i 'd probably start asking --
it is an old farm house
and it was so ugly .
uh , i do n't ,
once it starts boiling , i just , i cook it for a good seven minutes ,
um , it 's still out now , uh ,
she 's costa rican .
i grew up next door to , uh , the richardson symphony orchestra leader
oh man , in dallas you do n't even know who 's in , in administration ,
but they were n't rich ,
i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn ,
i had n't , i had n't thought about it because i do like what i do
we had her for , um , fifteen years , i think , my family did , and just loved her .
and , e p a never published that report .
and there might be a word or two changed .
we came , we came down from new york state in seventy-four , and uh , never had any regrets at all .
i mean , i , i do n't blame anybody when they have to work --
and he was the one that delivered it .
of course , you know , my fam- , my family has always had cars like that . uh , in that , you know , my father 's had a , had a , always had a v w bus every since , uh --
uh , i tried weight training
and now it 's practically all women .
we 've been in the house just the three years .
so wally moon moon shots and all that .
it is n't .
i enjoy music too
i , i do n't have a budget .
and he never ever thought of , uh , not going to school he said , in view of the fact that he was certain i had a hot line to his school .
the spring creek one is a lot more modern , has a lot more niceties , amenities
and i played in a tournament out there ,
i like to watch those skins games .
i 've , i 've heard of that .
it 's , it 's , it 's , uh , like a fad thing .
see that 's also on my list .
i have n't done , uh ,
that 's our channel here
and she 'll always get mad and say , you did n't read the , uh ,
i 'm in dallas .
so , my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town --
and the people in the city were saying , well why should i go do that . make the government do that , that 's not my job .
so , as long as you pay it off every month , it does n't cost you anything .
the neighborhood that we live , they are switching to an alternate calendar this year ,
my , my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre --
i 'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as i have been so .
and he said it was a great seat .
and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there .
but i do read sports illustrated --
that is one i 've been dying to see .
it 's like --
i said , yes .
and then when she decided to go back to work , um , she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home .
it was n't .
and it was , you know , in the seventies out here
but i spent a year in vermont , my freshman year ,
i even had friends when i was going to college who were in , uh , mumblex pharmacy school
but he controls that part
and that 's where i grew up ,
but we are not a farming --
there , there 's some other cars i 'd like
most everybody i 've been talking to is from texas ,
and he went there to go to the bathroom .
i have to do it the other way ,
and you do n't have kids , well it 's okay , no- , nobody does .
well , we 're --
and not only a- , not only low , there 's all sorts of a , of a benefits , uh , financial benefits associated --
and , and working girl is really good .
uh , my children like to watch sesame street .
i , i try to keep a book going all the time .
well certain schools do it .
people actually park their car when they get to their place they 're staying , townhouse or condominium , whatever they own
and we , we talk a bit about it ,
i 've watched that for about twelve years .
-- and , uh , but as far as shopping for a job , i 'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary .
it 's interesting when it gets really cold here
i 'm familiar with it ,
and i know , um , when i pick my kids up from school they want to come home .
well , he did , he had a , a red miata ,
if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones .
we have a , a dog that we got from the , uh ,
but , but they 're big fun .
uh , one 's a freshman in college
and we 're out , you know , uh , you know , fifteen thousand dollars
and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school .
well , i know the plan that i had with p i e , i could go to any doctor
so that 's , that 's about how things are
i agree with your parents ,
well , when we buy on credit we just do n't have a concept of how much money we 're spending --
the only thing i 've had problems with is , um ,
and how to save water b- , when you brush your teeth in water
but i only have a part time job --
and he 's minoring in english ,
uh , garp , the world according to garp .
i mean , it , it 'll tow three thousand pounds
i do n't have any , an- , children .
and put it , it goes directly to another account , that we do n't , at an entirely different bank , that we do n't have access to so easily ,
and it was like ninety-six dollars .
it did n't break anything ,
uh , you hit , you hit , uh ,
and i have kids ,
up here in the northeast , we have , uh , well w- , we have these mail order companies like l l bean
it 's really , really nice .
about the only thing you ca n't do is take that three person across seat ,
i really think it is .
and they said that he 's , you know , great in electronics
and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too .
we came from colorado ,
i , and , well , sometimes when i , i take my kids to the playground that 's the only other exercise i , i really think i do .
i 've seen cheers probably five times
because we had to take our dog in the car , there was no room for luggage .
and it was enough for all five of us , six of us .
uh , well i mean i 've had time to think about it because , uh , we 've had ,
i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year .
those three ,
probably not a practical attitude
well , see , they have that , um , what is it a mumblex test , or something like that they call it .
i was like a man starving at every meal .
you know , they 've got it all figured out .
and like hide and seek ,
he likes it .
but i 'm sure it creates a large amount of , you know ,
uh , lot of them related to , uh , business and financial matters since that 's what i do for a living .
i usually just buy a pattern book .
it is .
i probably could have lived a little longer .
but we sure felt like it was hurting us , just being there , you know .
but we 're , uh , we 're getting more into it
i like colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things .
the mazda definitely did not .
but it 's like dummies and things ,
and , and it was very foreign in a certain sense , although i had grown up in california
and you do n't have to worry about the high humidity .
you know , i still live in san jose
he had on two different shoes , one of which was not even his .
and we would have to , we 'd mumblex
and i just ca n't keep up .
um , he 's gotten out before ,
my wife worked until we had a family
and it 's probably gone by now .
these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year .
uh , and , you know , that meant that they had to play a second half
and i do n't know , you know , what , what 's , i mean , what are we supposed to , uh , compare it to --
an , and the way the law reads , uh , if they sentence you to life in prison , then he 's available for parole .
but they do n't have any cousins , uh ,
they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it , you know . that was going to use it for good ,
he 's a writer
the , the crime is not any better or any worse ,
-- and we caught , the individuals got caught ,
that was nice .
and she 's growing fast
and , then i rub it with a little bit , i rub the chicken with a little bit of oil ,
i do n't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort . um ,
and there is a island in the middle --
well , mine was two in march
i 'm just --
i mean , some nights it 's just real , real quiet .
i know those two .
and there 's no family there ,
but , you know , the interest , even though it bothered me , it did n't used to bother me so much , because , of course , you could list it on a schedule a
so we 're , you know , we do n't have that .
we always check and see if we should answer the door ,
she 's does n't like ,
um , see , i have to take , uh , medication for a , uh , for , for kidney transplant .
in fact , i really enjoy the playroom that ,
you know , someone will write a book about something
uh , we , we did all we could ,
i 've had to get it from oklahoma .
i , i do n't have cable --
-- and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine ,
-- but , it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little
and , she 's never been curious ,
-- and that is a little less trau , uh , burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her .
oh , the t v golfers they do that .
his name was sam huff .
i just heard about it the other night .
i did watch soap operas ,
and , uh , i do n't know why i never registered it
well it 's called seafood stew
but i 'm really not for sure , though , if
it was fun .
and so much of the music that was popular at that time , has come back .
um , i very seldom read a newspaper .
well , we 've always , uh , we 've always had oldsmobiles , and , uh , been very , uh , happy with oldsmobiles ,
my , uh , my roommate is a , uh ,
and , you know , chicago , back then , even had bilingual classes .
but we 're really not .
they have one under my first name and initial --
mumblex the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties --
we had a good time .
so , you know , depends also upon the , the level of the child .
i , i have no idea .
but , um , they , they are monitored by the , um , by the state school board .
but , it 's like a club ,
and i make quilts .
well , i 'm , i 'm happy we got through .
-- but the thing is , if somebody ruined their life , uh , society did n't try to then save themselves from it ,
i work for georgia tech
but in terms of his amount of hours at work , nothing on that has lightened up .
but that was , oh , good many , many years ago
and we saw cape fear .
that 's babies .
so , i enjoy , you know , cooking things to take over to her house
but if i had the little red c r x ,
and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had , uh , dumped all the trash in the same bin .
because me , myself , i just like to move really , really quickly .
i do n't work at t i .
i enjoy that a lot --
but --
it was something for children , that they , they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and , uh , getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it --
i mean , it was r- , it was a major issue ,
i know new york also has a sales tax on clothes --
we 're not , you know , you 're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery , or something like that as you would be with your own house .
but i do hear my friends talk about it .
oh , it sure is --
but --
it 's just a lot of fun .
i 'm from missouri
i 'd do it , i 'd use it for both .
i grew up in southern new jersey
i really just thought about it now
the competition is there ,
so , i have to , uh , think about things like that , too .
we just made up our own stupid little games .
and the difference in the radio with popular music ,
several times you 'll hit the wrong key , not intentionally or something
methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either
so , since then i have refrained from speaking any french .
and it did not work out . uh , at all .
uh , arrangement to , uh ,
and , and yet even he was a , a consummate politician in the sense that , uh , not only did he , uh , fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure --
and it was all this , this , um , divorced woman syndrome --
it 's , uh , it 's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things i am than i , even myself , than i used to be ,
and only now they 're getting that put in cars .
and he wanted another collection a year later .
and , uh , in fact , uh , i 'll be leaving very shortly to go to work
oh , i 'm guilty of that sometimes
and then i have a little boy who goes to , uh ,
it 's all chocolate , like made like a paper bag --
could have , uh , uh , fruits and , and pineapple , uh ,
it was just , one , the little bathroom , were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in .
mumblex it was not gross ,
uh , there 's another guy .
but since it 's just the two of us , it 's ,
i have n't gotten around to that .
you know , there 's a certain part of me ,
i mean i , i had n't thought about it that way
-- and each , uh , home does participate
but then , you know , at the same token , i 'm not against
but it 's beautiful in february .
and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for .
and suddenly there is n't a deer within fifty miles .
i , i work with a guy right now that , uh , races catamarans in the summertime --
you know , i 'm not saying that that 's not the case . uh ,
well , they offer classes out at , uh , ray hubbard .
oh , five years now .
i 'm the one that pays for the phone .
other than my children have gotten .
i kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately .
atlanta is horrible .
i figured i 'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean .
and i do go fishing .
he says yeah ,
i 'm for it in --
what 's so sad about this is both of the , the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers
i mean , i was raised by a man , my stepfather who , with a two handicap , i mean , he , he , he , he could get down on his knees and hit the ball , i mean , further than most people could hit it .
and you can get the information to set it up , you know --
right now both the mastercard and the visa , we do n't have to pay a yearly fee on
it 's a kind of a bad , a bad , bad example ,
-- so i bought one that 's more like living in a ,
but ,
and you kno , i have lot of friends right now that , uh , have young children
uh , we pretty much hire ,
and my french is pretty good
so . we 'll do , a lot of times vegetarian .
i was seeing what they was banging on .
and he said well gosh , you 're just healing really well ,
i know i associate the pollution with weather in general ,
in chicago ,
well , i even like jot .
but , i did n't really talk about that with her .
so ,
and then he would go to write it ,
and i like to drive pick up truck .
it took me like several months , or several weeks to do it during the summer ,
and then there 's the paper and plastic bag question .
and then it tapers off .
but it 's a solar , uh ,
well , i 'll have to put that , i 'll have to keep that on my list then .
and , and people have little cubicles .
and you make kind of a glaze ,
-- but again , that 's her decision --
i think like twen- ,
i do .
for the imagination of it all .
and they 're small , and , um , and fluffy ,
