74593,sw2445,h,"um , but I do n't know ,"
138518,sw2713,sv,"Oh , I do n't think it 's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and , MUMBLEx , on an individual basis ."
77101,sw2734,sv,"Well , anyhow I guess we both agree that ,"
181946,sw3284,sv,"Wel- , everybody has to do , has to do something ."
118130,sw2575,sv,"And , y- , the government 's going to be limited ."
43560,sw2263,sv,"You probably have more there , though , I would imagine ."
191449,sw3445,sv,"well , it 's just it 's something that anyone can watch and enjoy ."
8902,sw2354,sv,"I think it 's a miracle we 're all still alive after so many generations ,"
3354,sw2614,sv,You probably do n't see that .
49399,sw3028,sv,"and they , they form it ,"
2671,sw2289,sv,"if some people they have ,"
29222,sw2292,sv,"The one that 's like you get additional ,"
211732,sw3113,sv,People can be paid off or politically --
198179,sw3083,sv,"and , uh --"
72174,sw2840,sv,"and I 'll say , they 'll say , oh , well , our kids , my kid ,"
81545,sw2434,sv,"somebody wants to do that ,"
8171,sw2534,sv,"And , you know , they want , uh , privacy fences ."
200805,sw3441,sv,"Uh , that could , could be useful protection ."
988,sw3426,sv,"and life is a little slower , a little easier ."
187583,sw3135,sv,It 's not hard to find anything that 's part-time .
36332,sw2389,sv,"And now kids at sixteen years old , they have their birthday ,"
107848,sw3196,sv,"that 's true ,"
5563,sw2944,sv,"but it I guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that , it does seem that we 've , we 've slipped and that 's eroded ,"
135092,sw3105,sv,"there 's no reason ,"
195518,sw4109,sv,"We 'd have to we 'd have to build less prisons , you know , less police force ."
94855,sw2485,sv,"I know , that 's really neat ."
170055,sw3070,sv,so you usually are living where your parents live
150846,sw3207,sv,You think about it
196020,sw2775,sv,That 's a plus .
138025,sw3870,sv,And those operating systems have to change
165493,sw2717,sv,"I think , I think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say , you know , this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society"
124438,sw3029,sv,you can appeal it once .
87571,sw2020,sv,"I think it 's kind of absurd , you know , the fact that , you know , they do n't really , they do n't really give , you know , the original artist , or the original composer ,"
69209,sw2617,sv,"Uh , you know whether it was justified or not , I know , that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause ."
59395,sw3692,sv,"-- and then , all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their --"
190265,sw4341,sv,"I mean ,"
99365,sw3850,sv,"That was , that was pretty good ."
173728,sw3809,sv,"a woman Congressman I 'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as , and the same as a senator or whatever ."
159850,sw2504,sv,And they 're not always the best person for the job .
195698,sw4320,sv,and they --
101549,sw2710,sv,"So that , that would n't be too bad ."
149782,sw2587,sv,"and I , I guess when you 're in a big metropolitan area like this ,"
193074,sw3580,sv,I do n't know if we 'll ever see that up there .
186174,sw4082,sv,and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news .
165460,sw2717,sv,"Well I think in large measure the reason they do n't care ,"
190043,sw4372,sv,"Really , I , I , I do n't think that 's a valid argument ."
151202,sw3062,sv,"and ,"
107645,sw2992,sv,and I think those programs are really good for children .
211372,sw2060,sv,"So , you 're right ,"
47102,sw2830,sv,"and then you never use the V C R ,"
170360,sw4347,sv,"I mean , just like every other time that you look at it , the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there ."
149480,sw2067,sv,"uh , they are tempting at times ,"
35627,sw2679,sv,"But dinner parties are a lot of work , uh ,"
142092,sw3020,sv,Oh I 'm sure it was wonderful .
22473,sw3788,sv,"but I know that it 's important ,"
131574,sw3003,sv,It might not be brand new
206253,sw3411,sv,those are good products also .
210265,sw2370,sv,-- and I think that 's happened in a lot of cases .
59415,sw3692,sv,"I mean , uh , at one point , at least on a local level , um , going into politics is , you know , what you 're doing is , is really trying to serve the community --"
22471,sw3788,sv,"it 's awful ,"
213866,sw3134,sv,There will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world --
60784,sw2433,sv,"um , sometimes I feel like I 'm in a singles bar ."
105746,sw2616,sv,You did n't gain anything from it .
139310,sw2630,sv,"Of course , that period too was probably difficult ."
192445,sw4316,sv,"Stop trying to attack supply because , which , which to some extent makes sense and to some extent does n't ."
66573,sw2521,sv,They could not pitch .
143138,sw2405,sv,but it 's running about seventy --
63210,sw2545,sv,you have to be so precise .
168603,sw2826,sv,"and you realize it 's important that , uh ,"
107585,sw3596,sv,but that was very unseasonable for us down here .
177619,sw4826,sv,And that 's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal --
71261,sw2041,sv,"people from California seem to be more health motivated all around . I mean , as far as the diet , and everything . Uh , the diet and , uh , just your health consciousness ,"
195059,sw4181,sv,"I , uh , I really think that , here in Indiana at least we pay a , a whole , uh , just too much tax ."
206785,sw3161,sv,"Uh , it seems like there 's so much that goes to things that do n't really do a whole lot of good ."
81007,sw2229,sv,a lot of things do that .
146858,sw2259,sv,"I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last , uh , several years ."
153900,sw2005,sv,just because they 're grandparents .
190762,sw3658,sv,"I do n't think you , uh ,"
82285,sw2724,sv,I mean winters are kind of a problem
193057,sw3580,sv,"but if the time came , it 'd be real nervous ."
168330,sw3068,sv,"you need that first ,"
49299,sw2228,sv,but I think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again .
196878,sw4096,sv,"That 's a , that 's a common problem though ."
24362,sw3247,sv,"Well , in part it 's , uh , it 's the nature of societies , perhaps more homogenous society , in many cases , uh ,"
190989,sw4382,sv,"and , uh , uh , it 's supposed to have about the worst air pollution ."
96779,sw2299,sv,I 'm sure they are .
108428,sw3225,sv,"and it , it , it is really good ."
35642,sw2679,sv,"But , uh , so far as getting out there and , and putting it on , it only takes a litt- , a few minutes , uh ."
45538,sw3946,sv,if they could be up and doing some things --
23861,sw3769,sv,"-- and you can just relax , and --"
81239,sw2836,sv,"Uh , probably the biggest thing we 've got going now is the robberies"
164691,sw3334,sv,"this may be unfair to Mexico ,"
196434,sw2095,sv,"well I guess this , the weather is n't as lively a topic as , uh , as some of the others we might have gotten ."
185293,sw4628,sv,"and , you know , there are reason to look for another job --"
107934,sw3196,sv,"You know , one thing you might do with , in a situation like that , though , it 's just like keep ,"
183654,sw4380,sv,"I feel that my , uh ,"
193810,sw4038,sv,I was kind of boring .
182086,sw2554,sv,"As long as you have so many diverse groups that are , that are vying for power , it 's going to happen all the time ."
61972,sw2597,sv,It 's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks .
146955,sw3103,sv,"Of course , now fifty percent divorces in the United States , uh ,"
168100,sw3328,sv,-- no loopholes or anything .
42187,sw3716,sv,That is the hardest part probably .
20308,sw2478,sv,but there 's something like about eighty six billion that they admit .
34768,sw2373,sv,I think we should have stayed longer .
185660,sw4151,sv,"Oh , it 's a , uh , it 's a question of your , your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response ."
208384,sw2290,sv,That would be fun .
89025,sw2565,sv,Well it should be an interesting year .
41167,sw2234,sv,"but , I think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted , you know ,"
3714,sw2638,sv,"But it 'll save in some areas ,"
200077,sw2729,sv,"i- , it 's like , it 's like a kid ."
145414,sw2641,sv,"but I think they 're actually supposed to ,"
76955,sw4174,sv,"this is the university that has , for years had the , the car , that , uh , will travel the farthest on , uh , on a small quantity of gas ,"
146150,sw2253,sv,"and if you were trying to follow any type of , uh , plot , it , it total- ,"
188674,sw4060,sv,"But I agree , you know , the , uh , medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the , uh , security aspect for long term employment , uh ,"
131662,sw3003,sv,but unfortunately they think if it says B M W on it that you have money .
17672,sw3158,sv,"It 's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to , to weave the , the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand ."
639,sw2741,sv,and some is they 're more educated than they used to be I think .
118016,sw2575,sv,"it helps mature them a little bit , and helps them understand the world , the way it really is ."
195978,sw2775,sv,"That 's not so bad ,"
156692,sw4064,sv,And --
134030,sw2999,sv,"like you said , if you really , if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff ,"
60278,sw2773,sv,"they , uh , they 're , nobody likes them in that part of the world"
28616,sw2924,sv,"like if they 're on tr- , uh , trial for rape , you ca n't have any , you ca n't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff , or whatever ."
88021,sw2163,sv,"And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off , off your income tax --"
168558,sw2826,sv,but it 's that you are there when they need you .
115342,sw3804,sv,that was really good .
96243,sw4138,sv,"Uh , I wish the government would operate on the same premise that , uh , businesses operate on"
182234,sw2554,sv,"and until we , until we start changing our educational system , I mean we 're , we 're going to be ,"
31219,sw2754,sv,and so the guy might get off .
164181,sw2436,sv,and kids --
47993,sw2744,sv,"And speaking , speaking of doing what you want , uh , just in society today being that it 's nineteen ninety-one ,"
24359,sw3247,sv,"but they , they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates ."
25745,sw2898,sv,their style of play was so much different from --
81542,sw2434,sv,You 're not going to react that quickly .
141857,sw2393,sv,"So you 'll be cool all year around ,"
102105,sw2549,sv,"Well , I think we 're on , maybe ."
34868,sw2373,sv,and it 's really interesting .
41536,sw3204,sv,"And that might be a partial solution ,"
212502,sw3080,sv,"It 's , I mean , not just exercise , but anything ."
173404,sw3275,sv,I think they get a lot of people in trouble .
24552,sw3231,sv,and that one was .
70870,sw4114,sv,So it 's kind of an interesting situation .
57522,sw3694,sv,and it 's kind of dangerous .
171377,sw2439,sv,"-- and , uh , if I consider going the used car route and save up some money , I should n't have too much trouble at all ."
186214,sw4082,sv,"If I am an expert in it , they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I 'm not expert in it ."
84111,sw2465,sv,it did .
190911,sw4036,sv,Um . That 's interesting .
26678,sw2064,sv,"But , I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do ."
204523,sw3174,sv,-- they could just go off the deep end --
189329,sw3902,sv,most are n't .
174432,sw2910,sv,"-- and I , I feel that the , the only legitimate paper , although it might sound ,"
193842,sw4038,sv,That --
12428,sw2594,sv,and it 's surprising how much --
109746,sw2300,sv,"People still think we 're about ,"
121780,sw2452,sv,"but , you have to have loyalty ,"
93699,sw3023,sv,"However , I have been persuaded , lately , I guess , simply by the , uh , overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime ."
205537,sw3595,sv,"I mean , if you 've read one , I mean it 's ,"
47289,sw2830,sv,her disposition 's gone downhill .
67255,sw4618,sv,but --
16739,sw2379,sv,and there 's a notion of fairness .
33655,sw3077,sv,"but , I guess , you know ,"
179796,sw2640,sv,That 's not a bad idea
105872,sw2616,sv,"we just put our goals in different , you know , levels is"
184562,sw4346,sv,"though , I live in , you know , the real richy part , I guess ."
115573,sw2085,sv,"We 've got kids twenty years old , right now , that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications ."
30970,sw2794,sv,"Uh , my job is government tooling specialist ."
24311,sw3247,sv,"I , I feel like that child molestation and murder"
121836,sw2452,sv,And I think that 's good for the strength of the United Nations .
177253,sw3168,sv,"but , you know , those kind of things I 'd like to know --"
128604,sw2622,sv,And tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list .
115855,sw3030,sv,"so . That 's , um , a really good party time ,"
194350,sw2451,sv,"and uh , I think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things , too ."
105513,sw3355,sv,and the kids just love him .
181702,sw2896,sv,If it 's paper it will probably shred .
126540,sw3464,sv,"Uh , it says a lot about , uh , uh , you know ,"
142849,sw3515,sv,"send it to this address ,"
83844,sw4376,sv,"and so , uh , the likelihood that , you know , maybe expected , expected murders by him is , is , uh , integrated over the income of the people , uh , that he murders is maybe , you know , a loss of , who knows , eight hundred thousand dollars ."
77923,sw3988,sv,"it just , it just does n't do anything ."
51978,sw3363,sv,"Well , I think that , uh , you have an excellent deal then ,"
108577,sw3359,sv,"-- and so , uh , it , people , they , you know ,"
210179,sw2370,sv,It 's going to have to be both .
147499,sw2490,sv,"well any , any advantage that they can take ."
51880,sw3363,sv,"Well , you get a much bigger , better --"
163254,sw2842,sv,"You know , that 's good sometimes because you need to , you know , get away ."
102500,sw3232,sv,"and I would definitely get my money 's worth , uh , much better than State ."
108277,sw3537,sv,"Well , I think that should be , that , that 's a , another problem ,"
8414,sw2528,sv,also saves a lot of time with commercials .
9568,sw3597,sv,"And I , I , I think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment ."
66373,sw2521,sv,They 're going to go somewhere pretty shortly .
117242,sw2642,sv,"But that 's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time , ."
96031,sw4876,sv,"Well you must have a , just one hero ace professional job to support something like that ."
42623,sw2839,sv,"And the trouble is , you do n't , you have so little input about it ."
139433,sw2630,sv,"-- and , it sounds like they 're going to , you know , they 're ,"
99103,sw2094,sv,"and probably the only way that can happen is for , um , governments to realize that they have to pay if companies do n't ."
60210,sw2773,sv,"but I 'm just afraid it 's going , it 's going ,"
58365,sw2340,sv,"and they do n't care ,"
52111,sw3709,sv,"They tend to tighten up whenever , whenever you have to do something --"
32242,sw2432,sv,That 's why .
36394,sw2389,sv,"but I mean I do n't think you should just not listen to advice , even if you do n't take it , just listen ."
150248,sw2956,sv,"but the idea is to get the individual to the polls , a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls ."
98025,sw2362,sv,"we ca n't , we ca n't balance a checkbook without a calculator ."
102242,sw2549,sv,"they 're , they , they got a big thing because of the , you know , the , the expansion going on in baseball ."
129516,sw2926,sv,"I think we both agree on that , then , then , then , then a parent ,"
176654,sw2510,sv,Rather than just little fish .
175074,sw2970,sv,"and I do not think a lot of parents ,"
87832,sw3565,sv,I do n't know if it was just the .
567,sw2278,sv,"I mean , I mean , it 's almost four hundred ,"
42275,sw3751,sv,Ca n't never get out of debt .
44988,sw2323,sv,"But , yet , the , the government that 's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people"
154058,sw2154,sv,"That sounds good if you were short on time , you could get a summary real quick ."
2359,sw4774,sv,"You know , when they answer the company , I think it 'll make it a lot easier --"
151842,sw2589,sv,But there are times when a child needs to be spanked .
117800,sw2514,sv,and it 's just a big mess .
76340,sw3124,sv,"I mean it 's , it 's a nice , that 's a nice place , though ."
151792,sw2589,sv,"But , it 's going to tax you physically ."
85315,sw3367,sv,"Well , and even , even that I do n't really know if that would help ."
41914,sw3454,sv,you 're young .
47875,sw3118,sv,Maybe --
126519,sw3464,sv,"it 's , it 's interesting ."
64987,sw3406,sv,but I know we have n't cured it yet by a long shot .
66592,sw2521,sv,"and now they 're , uh , really playing as a , good together as a team ."
91276,sw2540,sv,And maybe they just do n't report those
46344,sw2413,sv,"I , I find that an interesting element of politics that we do n't , that , that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a , is a , you know ,"
182206,sw2554,sv,"You know , and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing ."
15285,sw2707,sv,"-- I guess in the ice age , it , it , it 's pushed a lot of , uh , limestone and everything ,"
152020,sw2012,sv,"Um , people start paying attention to you very much"
121494,sw2027,sv,It sounds like Mister Power Hungry .
156253,sw2932,sv,"So , I 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh ,"
165486,sw2717,sv,"I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that , I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder ."
189575,sw4830,sv,and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult . Uh .
59432,sw3692,sv,"But on the other hand , maybe that 's ,"
83228,sw2703,sv,"Oh , so it 'll go up ."
55576,sw2844,sv,"-- um , a a real intense burglar can just get another dog that 's in heat ."
76074,sw2334,sv,"Now Impact is kind of bad too , though ."
149446,sw3343,sv,I think --
1050,sw2040,sv,"I suppose the whole country , or the whole , um , new state would require such aid ."
132981,sw3095,sv,"Well , what you got is the situation wherein , uh , if you ever get in trouble , you want to hire the smartest , crookedest , lawyer you can find ."
15466,sw2707,sv,"and I said , Well , you 're not going to have to type on the computer one day ,"
130176,sw2110,sv,so we 're footing the bill on our taxes .
31586,sw3527,sv,And --
69146,sw2617,sv,"and I ,"
57458,sw3855,sv,"I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches , you know ."
97217,sw2743,sv,I think so .
8502,sw2528,sv,your occupation has nothing to do with it .
193517,sw4356,sv,"and this is out in California where , where they do n't make a car that 's got reasonable performance anymore ."
147861,sw4902,sv,"But if you let them , yeah . If you let them in a million at a time , it would n't make that , you know , it would n't make that big a bulge in the population . But --"
132423,sw2663,sv,and two years later he remembers that .
3469,sw2638,sv,I think that 's really the only fair way to do it .
112695,sw2380,sv,"though , uh , one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony , had a long criminal record and had been , you know , a real sleaze bag ."
55845,sw2983,sv,"Go somewhere really nice , like Hawaii , and just --"
26134,sw2967,sv,"It , uh , really is very , very interesting ."
85796,sw4311,sv,"Well , that 's an interesting thought because ,"
131372,sw3063,sv,"just to , um , think that way , we have to be in that thought pattern and able to , um , motivate ourselves to , um , uh , do what is right for the atmosphere ."
171208,sw2790,sv,"kids do n't , kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk"
63669,sw3523,sv,"I think that we 're probably going to see a lot more companies , uh , run by females ."
97392,sw3403,sv,"But , he 's , uh , he certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids ."
21491,sw2929,sv,"Um , I 'm not sure what else that , uh , we could address , uh , on health care , uh , other than the fact , I think , uh , the eyes and the ears and the , uh , whole self should be , uh , uh , included in all of that ."
205302,sw3476,sv,"But , I mean , and no one will , will go a step further to remove the english signs ."
176031,sw3246,sv,-- or just to face the children different directions or to do something --
70568,sw2460,sv,"they do n't have the offense to , uh , to get out , or to have the , the more runs ,"
99265,sw3615,sv,"-- then I think it , it is hard ."
159554,sw2466,sv,and then to have to deal with sexual abuse --
194640,sw3154,sv,it will be interesting to see how well that works
65765,sw3768,sv,"-- and it 's kind of nice to , to have that ."
35435,sw3257,sv,I 'm not into watching sports .
153607,sw2669,sv,"the metric system was still not ,"
196260,sw4333,sv,"but , but supposedly once you have an office in D C , or , you know , and , and staff it with people , it 's really tough to close it down"
66530,sw2521,sv,that would be real good .
48691,sw2149,sv,"and I think it gets them prepared to , to learn how to volunteer as they get older ."
154324,sw2603,sv,"The stationary bike is , is so , uh ,"
131347,sw3063,sv,And we need expert cooperation .
75431,sw2870,sv,"it 's really hard too ,"
204286,sw2406,sv,"It was , it was such a rout though , you know ."
74974,sw2160,sv,"But the guy at the very top , the one who 's , who 's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure , uh , the , uh , and had the political --"
117580,sw3773,sv,"and it 's , there 's nothing harder than that ."
181959,sw3284,sv,Military service is not that much
9542,sw3597,sv,"but I think that also ,"
89101,sw2599,sv,"Well , it 's kind of same for me ,"
178676,sw3550,sv,"If I had all the money I wanted , then that 's whole different matter ."
99347,sw3615,sv,"you know , how can you watch that , you know --"
160272,sw2427,sv,"But , uh , you know , you can improve your own soil there --"
86708,sw2302,sv,"But there should be with our overworked , uh , judicial system ,"
13227,sw3500,sv,If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor --
111807,sw2476,sv,"and , and then you , and then it 's not a choice anymore ."
111512,sw3097,sv,"Then as times changed , uh , as it is today , we do not do a lot of physical labor ,"
111414,sw3651,sv,"and I think the , the main thing is , like you say , it 's a , it 's a good out ."
150518,sw2078,sv,sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad .
174923,sw3320,sv,Supply and demand .
66828,sw4659,sv,and I guess every ten years it 's just been very different .
67199,sw4618,sv,"And if you could show that ,"
163241,sw2842,sv,"and , uh , because that I think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot ."
181338,sw3067,sv,"it requires a lot of effort to , to ,"
104115,sw3049,sv,"And , he has done a really good job of characterizing the , uh , disabled person ."
69231,sw2617,sv,and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us .
128012,sw3556,sv,He wanted to go out a winner though .
9088,sw3956,sv,"but it is , it does seem to be a big problem , you know ."
6701,sw3803,sv,"Uh , but on the other hand , you know , uh , like I say , I kind of , kind of against government control in general ."
108787,sw2515,sv,"Oh , no ,"
168096,sw3328,sv,That would be fair .
143110,sw2405,sv,they sit there
59398,sw3692,sv,and that 'll keep them busy enough so that they wo n't have as much influence .
161885,sw2820,sv,"Unless they say , well , look , unless they walk in , they could walk in and say , look , I did do drugs a year ago ,"
119899,sw3926,sv,"I think that a jury should listen to the courts , uh , to , to the hearings and to everything ,"
50779,sw4681,sv,"but something has to happen ,"
149585,sw2067,sv,"Well , it 's interesting , uh , that , uh ,"
120034,sw3090,sv,"So , I think it is probably better to have some sort of a , a , at least a record"
111960,sw2476,sv,"-- although during , during the Presidential debates , there was some really nasty patronizing ,"
71453,sw2220,sv,"You know , I mean they 're not the , the typical country where they 're just , you know , my wife left me , my dog left me , you know ."
120317,sw4707,sv,"Oh , I think the , the sales tax , they just got to do something about it ."
153035,sw4784,sv,"and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes having an educated populace and then --"
5573,sw2944,sv,"and also , I agree with that"
196863,sw4096,sv,"Uh , I did n't think that was a new revelation ."
210098,sw2370,sv,you 've got to have the flexibility that does n't really go with the family .
132859,sw4443,sv,"I mean , it seems like that , that would be an okay life just to hang out"
22641,sw2353,sv,"or they get ,"
179771,sw4801,sv,"I mean , it just seems ,"
17971,sw3282,sv,But then again they have to live in that environment .
78799,sw4633,sv,"Well , you ca n't afford to ."
21167,sw2675,sv,"Oh , I think a lot of people are ."
176637,sw2510,sv,"The , the saltwater fish have so much more color"

173413,sw3275,sv,"you charge this for twenty , charge that for twenty , charge this for twenty ,"
155161,sw2584,sv,"cause , because it is neat ."
118626,sw2766,sv,The fact that they take our money and do n't do what we think is right makes them thieves .
24518,sw3231,sv,"-- you know , Jody Foster was good , too , but I think , I think Anthony Perkins was the one that , that really made the movie ,"
116167,sw2424,sv,"Then , in , in the case of airlines , of course , they became highly competitive"
174604,sw2910,sv,And I do .
121092,sw2187,sv,a lot of people try to stay away from this
179060,sw3509,sv,"I mean , sure , their life is taken ,"
179885,sw2640,sv,"and either they 're in there ,"
3283,sw2614,sv,"I , I do n't understand it either , although I , I think a lot of South Americans regard the United States as , as bullying ."
112697,sw2380,sv,"and ,"
147249,sw2490,sv,"If your child is old enough ,"
161453,sw3693,sv,"And , uh , by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time ,"
99475,sw3850,sv,"But , um , there 's no , never anything good on Saturdays , though ."
211730,sw3113,sv,"I mean , we ca n't say it does n't , because it does happen ."
150515,sw2078,sv,"it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones ,"
725,sw2741,sv,"And I think that , uh , I think by the year two thousand it , we 're going to see some , a lot more changes , uh , hopefully , that women are , you know , able to get the , the executive jobs ,"
56528,sw2227,sv,well I used to hate STAR TREK .
160931,sw2262,sv,"and they find out , well , this dump does n't work"
112958,sw2579,sv,"well , of course , by the time it gets up here it may ru , run into a cold front coming down from Canada ."
68808,sw2645,sv,"and there 's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de- , the defense area but manufacturing in general ."
65106,sw2533,sv,"I mean , think , the , he , this chain that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground ,"
89184,sw2599,sv,"Uh , that 's a good question ."
122192,sw2181,sv,"MUMBLEx you know , those old movies seemed to have had something --"
202729,sw4928,sv,"and , uh , unless you do something like that , y- , you 're going to get sick ."
53890,sw2155,sv,"and the , the care that they are getting , the people who are giving it are pro- , are paid at a minimum wage ,"
85316,sw3367,sv,"I think a lot of these people do it , uh , mainly because of , of T V"
63619,sw3523,sv,"-- but , uh , uh , I think it 's not as much as it was ."
187058,sw3876,sv,"I think if we wait , uh , which is happening until somebody says we have to do it --"
165966,sw2231,sv,"and they get away with it ,"
137911,sw3681,sv,"Ooh , well that does n't leave a lot of time for hobbies ,"
85863,sw2421,sv,"Because , um , there are , there must be people like you , or in other circumstances , that could come up with , with , uh , false positives for certain kind of drugs ."
117435,sw2642,sv,"and you realize that you 're not buying anything on sale you 're paying , so much more for that item , because you 've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what , forty dollars sometimes just to have the card ."
45834,sw2662,sv,"I 'd be just fine without them , because , you know , kids come running out wanting to beat each other up ."
81626,sw2434,sv,He was fortunate .
38325,sw2692,sv,"But you better figure on multiplying that time out , about by at least by five or so ."
189717,sw4340,sv,I mean --
49583,sw4644,sv,you got Four Oh One K plans .
53748,sw3221,sv,"because it is really taking over ,"
110389,sw3449,sv,"I mean it 's , that 's very complicated ."
94199,sw2602,sv,"So until I see the entire , quote , old guard of the Soviet military , of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear , preferably buried , I still consider them a threat ."
94906,sw2435,sv,it was a pretty good movie .
176816,sw2998,sv,"and that 's always something that , you know , you just do n't real , you do n't think about ."
11288,sw3055,sv,"you do n't just make the dinner ,"
103948,sw3504,sv,"but , and I want to see them win , because you know , damn it , they , the fans deserve it ."
91389,sw4159,sv,"And , uh , granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged ,"
65602,sw2010,sv,it was a lot of fun .
148640,sw3236,sv,that will be easy .
26568,sw3013,sv,"It 's really funny ,"
179875,sw2640,sv,"Well , we definitely need a change in the system"
18623,sw3379,sv,"But at the same time I , I agree ."
38026,sw2426,sv,"Now , something that I read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab , uh , uh , their version or vision or whatever the United States , now , is somewhat changed in that we won , you know ."
196916,sw4096,sv,"so that makes sense ,"
28462,sw2924,sv,I think that 's actually good idea .
129526,sw2926,sv,"and it seems to me that mo- , money could be more well , well spent somewhere else ."
188838,sw4171,sv,That 's a long time .
131771,sw3535,sv,But they always please the money people too .
149858,sw2587,sv,"I mean , because that would definitely look like another Korea ,"
127068,sw2952,sv,When you are home --
111918,sw2476,sv,"I mean , it 's still ,"
132986,sw3095,sv,"To get him out of that , uh , uh , criminal mind that he has and to direct ,"
201560,sw3140,sv,"but it seems like ,"
159666,sw2466,sv,Even if you took speed reading . Huh .
75908,sw2072,sv,"you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete , uh ,"
9106,sw3956,sv,"now I , I do think the government , though , is going to have to do something , uh , with this problem , because , it , you know , even to go to a little doctor out here , just to ask him anything , costs you forty bucks --"
51900,sw3363,sv,"That 's , that 's unbelievable for that size of car ."
153643,sw3541,sv,"But , uh , now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of , you know , taxes on everything they buy , and where people that make , you know , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that , they are n't going to be paying taxes on , you know ."
146365,sw2965,sv,"so after buying the filter and all the oil , you 're looking at ten bucks at least ,"
36433,sw2389,sv,And different circumstances call for different things .
164456,sw2266,sv,"for example , like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time ,"
38042,sw2426,sv,"and , you know , we 've got the power ."
54887,sw2175,sv,"But it 's so expensive , man ."
8534,sw2528,sv,but it almost does n't look like it 's almost livable
143105,sw2405,sv,"But it 's amazing , you know ,"
159892,sw2504,sv,"and , uh , I do think more needs to be done along that line to help to , uh , teach the people , uh , uh , everyone , uh , more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting ."
106918,sw3072,sv,"It 's really , really pretty ."
98096,sw2362,sv,"and in the , the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again"
185452,sw4360,sv,"They , they did more things together ."
70081,sw2486,sv,"But , uh , the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you do n't really want ."
95724,sw2819,sv,"I think we ran out of social ,"
185040,sw4312,sv,"That 's all you really need for a lot of , lot of pop ."
111326,sw3651,sv,it is out of necessity
105923,sw2616,sv,"And that 's practically impossible to do now a days , for a company to ,"
98119,sw2362,sv,"I mean , I , I mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something ,"
183565,sw4158,sv,so --
193481,sw4356,sv,You ca n't do anything .
206965,sw3201,sv,"they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle , and what can you recycle and what you ca n't ."
86683,sw2657,sv,I think that 's a lot more realistic .
43291,sw2767,sv,"Which could be , you know , part- , partially cultural anyway ."
19570,sw2355,sv,"and I think there 's a lot of , um , kind of myths that we 've come a long way just in terms of our society ,"
136010,sw3802,sv,The bigger --
28460,sw2924,sv,"they said , I think the tape said something about changing , uh , changing it such that the ,"
71828,sw2858,sv,and then they look back .
199168,sw2539,sv,"you can not ,"
14624,sw2342,sv,"and , and , uh , I 'd , I 'd really like to see stability in that area , because I 'm always afraid that 's where another big war is going to start . Not that Desert Storm was a small one ."
196445,sw2095,sv,"man , I mean , it gets pretty mundane ,"
111134,sw3368,sv,that 's right .
40096,sw3280,sv,and sometimes .
109048,sw2893,sv,"Well smoking ages you quick ,"
29711,sw2854,sv,"Well , they need a schedule I think ."
198220,sw3083,sv,"well , you know , in a lot of cases like that , where , you know , if kids are going to a public parochial school like that , it 's , it 's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education . It shows , I think it shows that the parents have some , uh , desire for , for the kid to do , do well , you know ,"
201914,sw4765,sv,"And , but , but the , uh , uh , I , I really feel as though the interdiction effort is , is ,"
71319,sw2041,sv,"And , and you could have them around long enough"
116689,sw3131,sv,and we 're all heading that way
67426,sw2260,sv,"And it will , if have you a thirty year note , it will take like seven or plus years off of your note ."
130882,sw3340,sv,You do n't have the right to interfere in somebody 's life .
24166,sw3244,sv,And it seems to me that it 's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections --
27819,sw2557,sv,"Well , it sounds like they 're doing quite a bit ."
128937,sw3429,sv,"and now we have , now we have several , you know , we have to worry about AIDS"
198167,sw3083,sv,they put a lot more emphasis on athletics
123529,sw2482,sv,"So that 's , that 's not as bad ."
37047,sw3270,sv,"So there 's the potential that perhaps , you know , the U S budget might want to take a look at it 's , uh , federal employees or , and take a look at saying , well , let 's freeze wages ."
59624,sw2344,sv,and there 's just so much military machine there .
60083,sw2418,sv,"Oh , well , you 're doing , you 're doing just fine ,"
2773,sw2038,sv,"Well , when you take a , a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class , excuse me ,"
214464,sw2611,sv,that 's a good idea .
172739,sw3409,sv,well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that .
95121,sw2435,sv,We just keep breeding them .
50717,sw4681,sv,they wo n't be able to pay .
73373,sw3750,sv,"There are a lot of nice places ,"
153577,sw2669,sv,Kind of hard to do gradually .
110539,sw2849,sv,"but , but they 're protected in so many ways without having to , to pay for the rights and privileges ."
96252,sw4138,sv,"so there 's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we 're running ,"
116713,sw3096,sv,I think so .
201806,sw4370,sv,"Uh , and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure ."
117498,sw3773,sv,"I 'm probably older than you ,"
46141,sw3104,sv,"and you can spot them ,"
192342,sw4316,sv,"But , but the problem is , is that we , we only have but so much room"
150113,sw2956,sv,And then we further --
76999,sw4174,sv,"Best training in the world is not going to f- , put food on your table ."
5343,sw2981,sv,"Those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty , which I think is a little too limited ."
73524,sw3586,sv,"and , you know , when you die , it 's like , when they die it 's more like an investment ."
116629,sw3131,sv,you know they ca n't get out and see anyone
174901,sw3320,sv,"years ago , you thought , well , these little small cities and all , would n't have that problem ,"
179049,sw3509,sv,"Uh , I , you know , I think to a certain degree , the reason that it , it does n't serve as a deterrent , uh , may be because y- , you never know if it 's going to be a , applied . Right ,"
109908,sw3283,sv,I mean it 's not the judge 's fault I do n't think .
103123,sw2197,sv,"And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect ,"
18630,sw3379,sv,"And , you know , we need to solve these international problems"
102849,sw2102,sv,"people were just as violent before T V was invented , maybe even more so ."
7051,sw3019,sv,But she was probably depressed to begin with .
32675,sw3016,sv,"Um , it 's a little bit like junk mail but except you ca n't , you know , ignore it , uh , quite as easily ."
45744,sw4615,sv,"you better have some other way of , uh , savings ,"
209849,sw3862,sv,"Uh , the , the attitude of the staff as you said is really --"
14506,sw2888,sv,"And I just , I just see that dwindling in , in ,"
190246,sw4341,sv,I think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not .
5995,sw3265,sv,"with so many options now available , you know , where , where cars are concerned , it just seems like there is , there 's almost too much of a choice anymore ."
176137,sw4697,sv,"I would tend , myself , to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a , anytime a , one of the parties wants one ."
195823,sw3144,sv,"and it 's just , it 's just goofy ."
131115,sw3018,sv,"I do n't think there were , Uh ,"
113055,sw2579,sv,and what have you and giving you traction .
146676,sw3269,sv,"Well , it takes a little brainwashing first ."
118788,sw2900,sv,"I mean , the ,"
37488,sw4770,sv,"Well , that 's exactly what happens in government all the time ."
116358,sw2287,sv,and he 'll be so far off the wall that they 'll elect him .
178088,sw2658,sv,"So , I do n't think , I do n't think there will be too much problem"
123235,sw3402,sv,"and then , of course , one thing I think , too , is with tele- ,"
73086,sw3639,sv,"and , but the particular seems to be the , uh , the quiet ride ."
154224,sw4720,sv,"just , just getting there , is , has to be half the fun ."
182052,sw2554,sv,"In fact , it really was to begin with ."
189150,sw4329,sv,It 's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher .
55336,sw2844,sv,"They do n't have that much money on hand ,"
127970,sw3556,sv,"Well , that 's an interesting channel ."
97497,sw3503,sv,"Well , I guess in cases like that , you know , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again --"
157508,sw3021,sv,we can handle it
51198,sw2576,sv,"and , uh , they do n't --"
96841,sw2299,sv,get the kids --
26608,sw2064,sv,I mean they 're anxious for someone to be killed .
155052,sw2584,sv,Years ago it would have been fine
80277,sw2151,sv,"and they do n't follow it at all , you know ."
179244,sw2568,sv,but that that 's really like an all time classic .
75285,sw3425,sv,"I think when we do it ourselves ,"
38232,sw2692,sv,"Li , little things like that , that really start to aggravate you ."
191892,sw2789,sv,it 's fun .
37803,sw3346,sv,they 're just not made to do that type of thing --
20428,sw2812,sv,"and some of the other stuff that , um , I think that changed it , you , uh , when I first got out of college fifteen years ago , they were always saying well , if you , if you were assertive you were a libber ,"
183889,sw4334,sv,so --
109860,sw2300,sv,Absolutely pathetic .
107404,sw3381,sv,I think that could be true too .
183252,sw4133,sv,"So , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it 's really being used today ,"
96229,sw3387,sv,"if you make forty million dollars , uh , then you 're going to pay four million ."
57274,sw2237,sv,"and then he sprays his yard ,"
205343,sw3561,sv,"I , I think that you 're absolutely right there ."
61370,sw2279,sv,"well , first , they always say , get to know your country first before you leave ,"
160924,sw2262,sv,"and ,"
48624,sw2149,sv,"but , but other than that I think it 's , it 's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and , you know , like the , uh , shelters and , uh , , that kind of , thing ,"
65000,sw3406,sv,"Automobiles of course are contributing , too ,"
114770,sw4147,sv,"Well , I guess , in one sense we felt that , it , it 's nice to have a dog even though there are , you know , complications come with it ."
153670,sw3541,sv,"but it , it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax , uh , on top of it ."
88245,sw3115,sv,"It , it takes their minds off of , of trying to compete ."
114180,sw2431,sv,"Well , you know what the average person ,"
9848,sw2716,sv,"So maybe , that 's like the extreme of it ."
159737,sw2504,sv,Because people have to vote in different areas
77972,sw3988,sv,you sure do .
30876,sw2794,sv,"and this would have to come rather quickly , and would have to come originally also where we 're not paying ,"
191709,sw4104,sv,they could very well
125281,sw2631,sv,"but I think , um , that I , that that 's probably one of the biggest difficulties , uh ,"
177999,sw2658,sv,I think that 's the worst part .
189674,sw4830,sv,"I , I feel that everyone is , everyone is , uh , entitled to a trial by jury ."
165618,sw2717,sv,"but , um , some of these people are just out and out brutal ."
183265,sw4133,sv,"I mean , it 's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon , you know ,"
50611,sw3151,sv,"Well , people tend to --"
203749,sw2604,sv,"I mean , if , if you 're talking about any- , if you 're talking about something that 's like a full time , you know , one year full time , you know , this is what you do , you know ."
159875,sw2504,sv,they 'd be ready to vote .
74956,sw2160,sv,they 'll never get caught .
201402,sw3883,sv,they look tacky a lot
20774,sw2812,sv,that 's even better .
42489,sw3521,sv,"-- that , there is , uh , local news that , uh , that really a lot of times does n't , does n't change , change my life one way or the other ."
128543,sw2622,sv,"Well we 're really overburdened from federal , state and local ,"
111109,sw3453,sv,"I might consider it the next time ,"
24945,sw3162,sv,"So it 's , it may be an idea to think about , you know , cost ."
42653,sw2839,sv,"the , the , the idea of what you need to , to exist is so outrageous that it 's not --"
121725,sw2452,sv,"And , and you 're right ,"
148094,sw4077,sv,in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States .
132463,sw2663,sv,"but I think your mayor ,"
97671,sw2648,sv,"you know , wh , when you consider , you know , it 's probably not radioactive"
120459,sw3143,sv,"I think if they knew it was going to be really horrible , wherever they were going , maybe they 'd think twice about doing it ."
164196,sw2436,sv,"you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something , because those drive you crazy , if you 're , if you 're in the room ."
43400,sw2767,sv,"So then I 'm , uh , uh , probably a poor example , although , you know , I was an administrator and could still be I suppose ."
166696,sw2866,sv,I think they did a great job .
200512,sw4079,sv,"Uh , cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget . Not only for buying them , but for keeping them on the road too ."
153801,sw2005,sv,"Unfortunately , a lot of times it , responsibilities like that seem to fall to , you know , maybe one child in the whole family , you know ."
133738,sw2235,sv,it 's just a give away .
45527,sw3946,sv,"But I think it 's an issue that , you know ,"
131698,sw3535,sv,"and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available , because they 're in on the know , you know ."
141219,sw2221,sv,"Anything that they 've earned while they 're in prison should go back to the State except for that , you know , there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with ."
30877,sw2794,sv,"in some cases we do pay more , for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment ."
126565,sw3464,sv,"Uh , really , really good ."
189723,sw4340,sv,"Uh , when I think of crime , I think of stuff that , that affects other people like people getting , you know , killed or raped ."
93762,sw3023,sv,"and then you start making a movie and it has no , there 's no call for something violent ,"
123636,sw3092,sv,And if they were in the same building --
41545,sw3204,sv,"Well , I , I think we kind of are along the same lines ."
153925,sw2005,sv,"-- but the qua- , but actually have a truer standard of living ."
2769,sw2038,sv,"with , with other things going on , it , it seems to have lessened ,"
116325,sw2287,sv,"then , you know , it could , uh , it could lead to some serious things ."
152244,sw2171,sv,"I mean , and it 's nice to , to try to teach young people some , some , uh , uh , civil , uh , consciousness , but forcing them to , to donate basically their time and efforts ,"
164692,sw3334,sv,"but it seems like there 's a lack of honesty in , in foreign policy a lot of the times ."
70157,sw2486,sv,and I think that 's good because it does allow people to be individual
197811,sw2145,sv,"In fact , I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession ."
88223,sw3115,sv,"And , and yet we ca n't to that either ."
22884,sw2621,sv,"I think he is ,"
50195,sw2917,sv,"This , you buy what you can afford ."
139122,sw2630,sv,"-- and , uh , and if you get that you can ,"
61254,sw2124,sv,"because I guess , I guess I feel like if they 're on a diet like that , I 'm going to , you know , honor that ,"
66368,sw2521,sv,"Well , I would say the Saints after ,"
137035,sw3050,sv,"And you know that 's why ,"
134841,sw2875,sv,"and you think that ca n't possibly be done ,"
166069,sw2231,sv,and nothing happens .
164748,sw4008,sv,"I used to use a , just an Apple two E , which of course is --"
30012,sw2524,sv,"Those are real popular ,"
99093,sw2094,sv,"Um , so I suspect that that 's one thing that , that as individuals , we can do , make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators ."
28804,sw2834,sv,so --
170937,sw3045,sv,That 's probably where you 've used it .
193498,sw4356,sv,"and , you know , I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore ."
8892,sw2354,sv,"I know there 's not any food that you can get ,"
112671,sw2380,sv,"and it seems a lot of times that , uh , especially in criminals that , their rights are so protected"
52532,sw2803,sv,"And so , I think , you know , before the father would work"
204344,sw2093,sv,it 's a good time for gardening .
105312,sw3012,sv,"They love violent leaders , to , you know ,"
139627,sw3087,sv,It 's good to cover all the bases there .
10399,sw2768,sv,"people need to take groups of children ,"
120473,sw3143,sv,"because they get involved in things so young that they do n't really ,"
69706,sw3111,sv,"you know , it 's a different viewpoint ."
190202,sw4166,sv,"And , you know , there 's a lot of , number of"
163641,sw4858,sv,it 's funny .
14987,sw2709,sv,"Well , and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change ."
152938,sw4483,sv,have them do a little bit of the sorting .
39813,sw3250,sv,-- that 's true .
15289,sw2707,sv,"I 'm sure the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of Dallas ,"
32375,sw2884,sv,"Well , you know , you know , you know , what 's always good is sort of a for savings , where they just take money out of you 're pay ."
96888,sw2299,sv,"If everybody tries to do just a little bit , and a little bit more then --"
193627,sw3798,sv,"I mean , I , I can see that research is needed"
189572,sw4830,sv,"Uh , one man can never be , one man , one woman can never be objectionable in every case ."
153875,sw2005,sv,"You know it 's , it 's interesting that , that a lot , the population of the United States is changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time ."
119343,sw3845,sv,"before I got the answering machine , it was ridiculous --"
208779,sw3801,sv,"Well , with all the , uh , Central Expressway , uh ,"
19586,sw2355,sv,"I mean like I say , we 've come a long way , but we have , I mean , twice as far to go ,"
114318,sw2431,sv,"-- and , I mean it was fantastic ,"
43116,sw3009,sv,"I think you start out with the criteria of , you know , do I know of anything"
66943,sw3294,sv,"-- but they never say who , who they 're really working for or what , you know , what --"
211669,sw3925,sv,"I mean I just think that 's human nature that you 're going to have corruption in government , in business , personal life , I mean , you know ."
196689,sw3133,sv,I mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much --
35131,sw2957,sv,Maybe not as much as now
120769,sw4726,sv,"Well , I think that people should be allowed to have them ."
121816,sw2452,sv,"and I think , that 's how you have to go into something like that ."
123451,sw2482,sv,"to some extent the public schools , or the schools in general ,"
212011,sw2107,sv,and they have so much more personality than a dog .
122146,sw2181,sv,"I realize that . I mean , to go to these movies and expect them to be , you know , other than just , just good entertainment --"
84940,sw2527,sv,"Well , I guess we 've talked as much as we need to on the subject ."
20414,sw2812,sv,"Um , uh , before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like , uh , black people , or , you know , just large , large groups of people ,"
33612,sw3077,sv,"but like what I was saying about the social security , that 's real , you know ,"
162200,sw2897,sv,"-- and at least , you know , financially in the short run ,"
9286,sw2871,sv,the problem is you always have to wait until they 're out .
205341,sw3561,sv,"Uh , the short term , the recession is getting , getting top attention ."
117153,sw2105,sv,unfortunately the Rangers do n't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do .
35282,sw2993,sv,"But once you get , if you , once you get something fancy , you get stuck somewhere off of the main area --"
3297,sw2614,sv,"We think of ourselves as the only Americans , when they 're Americans , too ."
42563,sw2839,sv,"-- they kept doing , they kept putting off doing that ."
117847,sw2514,sv,"It really impressed me , just you know , feeling"
61628,sw2619,sv,"Um , the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and ,"
34170,sw2190,sv,"but when you se- , when you get up in the morning in , in Dallas and , and see all that haze from west Texas ,"
64067,sw4363,sv,"I , I do n't think anything will ever take over the N F L ."
192287,sw3227,sv,and you have a country and western song --
114420,sw2431,sv,"These cars , I guess they figure all the old cars , will be off the roads or something by the , in ten years --"
153594,sw2669,sv,"but they 'd need , they 'd seem to be ticking off faster , too ."
185512,sw4360,sv,"I think maybe those people that really do need to work , both parents , just to survive ."
67883,sw3628,sv,"Um , I think , uh , the biggest limitation is a lot , just time and money , is n't it ."
43123,sw3009,sv,"And then , you know , I mean , even at that you have to consider the logistics of it ."
196173,sw2775,sv,That was a pain .
59380,sw3692,sv,"Well , I think they should , they should limit the Senate to one term , one six year term ."
209625,sw2305,sv,"Probably , you probably got everybody on you , because they were probably all going to law school ."
26648,sw2064,sv,"and there really are criminals that are hard-core and ,"
200549,sw4079,sv,"Of course , the longer you keep it beyond that point , the more profitable it is to own it yourself ."
185564,sw4362,sv,so it 's hard to compare .
10796,sw2090,sv,"and it 's the wedding season , I guess ."
38946,sw2968,sv,"It is , it is , it is , uh , interesting , uh , with the computer to read the computer news and ,"
21209,sw2675,sv,"but I think the jury should be able to recommend ,"
202922,sw2429,sv,Sucking the head
165713,sw2634,sv,"but whether it be the , your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun ."
62905,sw2499,sv,"But , you know , critically acclaimed ."
131382,sw3063,sv,education is a big thing --
83831,sw4376,sv,"So , you know , if you weight everyone equally , then you have to say , well the likelihood of not terminating him ,"
113789,sw2847,sv,"That 's ,"
79653,sw2130,sv,"they end up being , becoming divisive themselves ."
160142,sw2427,sv,But it 's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself .
63531,sw3051,sv,"and I , I do n't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house ."
146253,sw4572,sv,"and if they 're , you know , if they 're on some kind of , you know , contol , controlled substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who is able to evaluate them ."
151849,sw2012,sv,"And the first kind of invasion of , the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me , and very much everyday in this country ,"
45756,sw4615,sv,"I mean it , it 's nice for people buying homes"
34704,sw2293,sv,"I guess it 's kind of like , kind of like cigarette smoking , you know ."
48572,sw3734,sv,They 're really comfortable .
181748,sw2896,sv,If you take it up the next day it should be fine .
183640,sw4158,sv,MUMBLEx help a lot .
64549,sw4691,sv,"-- you , you miss that ."
146249,sw4572,sv,"although they do n't actually e , execute it themselves , it 's really the government that MUMBLEx ."
28879,sw2834,sv,"they wanted to be like men ,"
28665,sw2924,sv,"A lot , uh , a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the , um , general public wants ,"
151843,sw2589,sv,"I mean , they do things that they need that ."
192312,sw4316,sv,"but ,"
139754,sw2376,sv,But I think that 's probably a good idea .
133749,sw2235,sv,"but because there 's no strings attached , it like gives them a freedom to give us something back ."
114795,sw4147,sv,"it 's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly , uh ,"
169495,sw3238,sv,"I mean I think sometimes some of the , the women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know ,"
73014,sw3606,sv,"It 's , it 's too bad"
173929,sw3331,sv,"Well , what I believe is one of the major pro- , uh , things that is wrong with our public school system is that , um , we do not have enough discipline --"
9537,sw3597,sv,"and , another thing I think has changed quite a bit is , uh , the roles that men and women play ."
214187,sw3324,sv,"And , uh , I , I think it 's gotten , uh , very different ."
132424,sw2663,sv,And what they done is they 've bought this congressman for two years .
169445,sw3099,sv,"They , they adjust to what the parents MUMBLEx ."
73163,sw3639,sv,You go out and get in that real cold car --
130087,sw2110,sv,that would be neat .
81220,sw2229,sv,"Now , that 's a thought ."
84500,sw3223,sv,"but there 's a sense of ho- , I guess , purity in the show ,"
162444,sw2915,sv,"but it 's not enough , you know ."
193061,sw3580,sv,That 'd be pretty hairy .
92874,sw2598,sv,"you think , you know , for a Stephen , you know , it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory"
137952,sw3870,sv,"Well , I think it 's inevitable that we are going to see national health care"
67588,sw2383,sv,"Um , as far as the system as a whole , I really do n't see a problem with it ."
19984,sw3054,sv,"Well , there , well supposedly ,"
94281,sw2602,sv,Gorbachev has made his attempt
189654,sw4830,sv,"Uh , a- , like I said , as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence , that 's absurd ."
23314,sw2959,sv,"and ,"
109734,sw2300,sv,we got ripped off buying our new car .
21820,sw2437,sv,"The key thing that I think , that we try to do , is that bring all the friends over here ."
162083,sw3533,sv,"I think parents are definitely , uh , spending more and more time ."
68246,sw2032,sv,Him just standing there .
173033,sw2525,sv,"And as far as like them , uh , entertaining the rights that they should have ."
87625,sw2020,sv,I did too .
79110,sw2835,sv,Those are cool .
89693,sw3081,sv,"Not my favorite place , but ."
13005,sw3745,sv,"and really society sort of dictates that , uh , you know , both the parents work ."
57426,sw3855,sv,"even if it 's five bucks , even ."
759,sw2741,sv,And I think that is happening more and more .
191815,sw4327,sv,"and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas us , we write a check ."
4437,sw2168,sv,"I think it would be better for the teachers and for the children , because we would do away with so much of the burn-out that we have ."
66751,sw4659,sv,"and because of that , these quote , unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder ."
175171,sw2970,sv,No matter who they are
4254,sw3281,sv,You probably have to buy that from specialty stores .
122008,sw2181,sv,"but there 's something about it that just , it is n't just slapstick ,"
17406,sw3042,sv,"I think a lot of this is coming out of ,"
90293,sw4603,sv,"my , my point was that there is , for people who do n't want to do the military service , there , it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and , uh , sense of community that the Boy Scouts ,"
183082,sw4358,sv,"I think that 's , that 's what they need to do . Be more proactive like that ."
147039,sw3103,sv,"And , uh , I think that , uh , in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve ."
118663,sw2766,sv,It 's okay for us to go extend our youth 's lives like so much water in the desert .
5319,sw2981,sv,"I think there 's probably things I could think of short of murder that someone , I think someone would probably deserve to be killed for ."
160952,sw2262,sv,It 's scary .
192841,sw2109,sv,"but I was , it was great ."
190133,sw4166,sv,"Uh , you know , they do n't always have their full wits about them ."
194308,sw2451,sv,"So I think that 's where you know , , kind of where he 's stuck ."
124462,sw3029,sv,"But because he was n't read his rights whenever he was arrested , you know ,"
21465,sw2929,sv,"And I 'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor , and hopefully that they would have their , um , accreditations there too ."
191072,sw4049,sv,"I do n't think there 's any definitive , you know ,"
47418,sw2830,sv,it 's weird .
91147,sw2818,sv,"Now it 's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly , I 'm sure ."
69991,sw3539,sv,The hard thing is getting going .
86002,sw2421,sv,I guess if that 's all we 've done
34787,sw2373,sv,"I think we should have helped the , the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more ,"
192991,sw3435,sv,that 's pretty good .
116217,sw2424,sv,"And , well , anyway that would , of course , eventually come back to taxes ."
58837,sw3121,sv,"Well , they 're so spread out ,"
191597,sw4336,sv,"like I say , lot of , lot of cases is usually just apartments and , and break ins and things like that"
34371,sw3463,sv,"And it 's getting the respect and , which is about time ."
194448,sw4349,sv,"So those small little trucks and cars like that , they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good ."
96961,sw2314,sv,"If someone 's having personal problems for some reason that 's causing them to h- , behave differently --"
190707,sw2593,sv,"but , and , I mean , I 'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that"
78836,sw4633,sv,but I 'm not sure I could afford three .
57400,sw3855,sv,and I think that 's terrible .
1026,sw2040,sv,"Um , part of this I suppose is justified in , in that the climate they do n't need , perhaps , the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need ."
174913,sw3320,sv,but --
213220,sw3142,sv,You 're brave .
150507,sw2078,sv,"I mean it 's good because they , they try new things , you know ,"
199586,sw2628,sv,"and , really , if you do n't want the kids , then it 's not the time to have ,"
170381,sw4347,sv,"because technology is so , uh , you know , volatile and changing all the time ."
105243,sw3012,sv,and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours .
67032,sw4022,sv,"especially the Democratic candidates do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah , maybe that could do something to affect our budget --"
89560,sw3728,sv,"I , I guess I 'm satisfied ,"
99159,sw2094,sv,"So I suspect that it 's , it 's an ever growing problem ."
129966,sw2110,sv,"Uh , I thought it a good idea too , though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money ."
70816,sw4114,sv,You get the car that 's in the accident
122652,sw4752,sv,"they go to jail ,"
206766,sw3161,sv,"I mean it 's not so serious , I guess , until it affects your family"
17914,sw3282,sv,"I think , you know , we should have got him while we could --"
56173,sw4745,sv,"and pretty soon , you know , you 're at the limit where you 've got to say okay , you 've sacrificed for , you know , so many years at home"
104886,sw2938,sv,"Well , uh , the , you know , pregnant women are n't supposed to walk along a highway --"
8246,sw2534,sv,"You know , they just , they just breed these , they breed them before they 're ready ,"
30194,sw3290,sv,"You know , I think it 's one of those things where it 's not viewed upon as being professional ."
79723,sw2324,sv,"-- and I 'm not some kind of an idiot ,"
149775,sw2587,sv,"Which is n't , you know , pretty much what we loo , look for anyway ."
23604,sw3567,sv,"and , and , uh --"
129265,sw4905,sv,"MUMBLEx want to just , you know , all your salary ca n't even begin --"
118710,sw2766,sv,That 's right .
205352,sw3561,sv,It can only hurt the deficit picture .
46373,sw2413,sv,I think they ought to get on with something important .
91576,sw2285,sv,"you do n't know ,"
152,sw3743,sv,Uh-huh .
170717,sw4055,sv,I 'd say I camp quite a bit .
35909,sw2689,sv,So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something .
9497,sw3597,sv,and to me that 's surprising .
109574,sw2313,sv,"So , uh --"
192054,sw2789,sv,"Those aerobic classes are , are tough the , the high impact ."
204744,sw2749,sv,He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together .
86733,sw2302,sv,"or do they need a six person jury or , you know , those kinds of things"
155073,sw2584,sv,I 'm just a chicken .
156965,sw3052,sv,"It 's just a matter of finding ,"
190277,sw4341,sv,"I just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes ,"
146790,sw3303,sv,"Well , that 's an up and coming team , though ."
90666,sw4548,sv,I do n't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two .
77157,sw2734,sv,"I , I think it certainly should be one of the options ."
106643,sw2079,sv,"Oh , that 's , uh , that 's , uh , an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell , I guess ."
127697,sw2180,sv,"I , I think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that , uh , you know , people would get a fair trial ,"
131322,sw3063,sv,"Well , people think you burn it , it 's gone ,"
194998,sw4646,sv,"So , it , it 's just so complicated anymore , I think ."
212491,sw3080,sv,"-- and that 's the hard decision , is , okay , if I 'm going to run in the mornings , what am I , what do I trade it off for ."
30911,sw2794,sv,"So , we could do the same thing ,"
101908,sw3254,sv,You go somewhere else .
15924,sw2953,sv,"Well , I think ,"
124791,sw2793,sv,and that 's themselves .
108440,sw3225,sv,but --
153921,sw2005,sv,"I mean ,"
126013,sw4917,sv,that 's a pretty good price
13672,sw2368,sv,"You know , um , I used to think that Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning --"
159341,sw2035,sv,"it makes it a little bit easier , I think , that way ."
182154,sw2554,sv,"You know , uh , we sit there"
183237,sw4155,sv,I doubt about that .
48004,sw2744,sv,"that can , that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day , or more in school"
111113,sw3453,sv,"They , they had a , a lot more trunk space ."
191882,sw2789,sv,"It 's , uh , it 's a new , uh , form I think ,"
76919,sw4174,sv,"because , you know , they 're just , uh , in my experience ,"
167266,sw2469,sv,"It 's just the same old thing ,"
28506,sw2924,sv,"They quickly let you off jury duty I hear , um ."
143809,sw2157,sv,Make sure we get our cash flow .
50347,sw2917,sv,"You know ,"
201928,sw4765,sv,"but , but people --"
192922,sw3435,sv,That 's something I could learn actually .
185604,sw4362,sv,"Well , that 's odd because I do n't think the teachers in my school district , uh , were well paid ."
203776,sw2604,sv,And this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem .
182705,sw3420,sv,"I 'm sure that , um , whatever you decide , you 'll be happy with ."
73487,sw3586,sv,and --
202112,sw2477,sv,"uh , Detroit has n't been having that great a year this year ."
147535,sw3784,sv,"Mandatory , I mean , summary execution , on the steps , that day ."
145993,sw2253,sv,and they had an interesting time there .
185269,sw4628,sv,but you are responsible for that company growth .
115805,sw3030,sv,"I- , it 's very difficult to purchase , um , items that are as good as what you can make yourself ."
66827,sw4659,sv,"it 's just very , very different"
110595,sw2849,sv,"That 's the way , the way the pendulum seems to be swinging , right now ."
18364,sw4037,sv,"I think that maybe , uh , a good solution to capital punishment might be , uh , reserve it solely for , uh , repeat offenders of a crime like , uh , murder ."
113232,sw3421,sv,"Uh , and , but , but , a little bit strange and esoteric"
173714,sw3809,sv,"but there 's still a , an , an inequality in the --"
208042,sw2759,sv,"and ,"
93814,sw3023,sv,"and , and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now , that that 's complicated the entire process ."
124851,sw2793,sv,"Well , then I guess there are a lot of , a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country ."
25433,sw2495,sv,"Well , it 's , it 's not that easy ."
70981,sw4184,sv,I think they have a good head on their shoulders .
34776,sw2373,sv,And it 's almost like they 're killing each other off
71735,sw2858,sv,"Um , I think , uh , like in my situation , today , on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together , my husband 's been off doing his thing all day today ,"
168545,sw2826,sv,"And , and when there 's nobody there ,"
42554,sw2839,sv,but not as much as we should .
40930,sw3455,sv,They 're more interesting .
109931,sw3283,sv,but I do believe it should be befitting the crime .
55207,sw4716,sv,"And , but I think the , I think semiautomatic weapons , people say they use them because it , for sport ."
113429,sw2969,sv,It is some type of lily .
186321,sw4153,sv,"I- , it sound ,"
22903,sw2621,sv,"it 's , it 's a gamble ,"
156399,sw2932,sv,"Oh , well , this is a wonderful thing that , that you 're doing here still helping them out ."
47319,sw2830,sv,"and then , you know , you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it"
45278,sw2578,sv,"It 's not like , uh , most television where you , you know , you just , you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but ,"
2330,sw2788,sv,"It 's , it 's not there ."
10184,sw2768,sv,"And my biggest fear would , that they would be , is that they would be lonely ."
38035,sw2426,sv,"and we went in and did in seven days what Iran could n't do in seven years , you know ."
96244,sw4138,sv,"and that is , uh --"
186033,sw2945,sv,"And , and the cost of living here is just so tremendously , you know , outrageous ."
125686,sw3071,sv,"and , um , I 'm sure that it , for you , it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself ,"
8394,sw2528,sv,And there 's a lot of those MUMBLEx Blair shows floating around .
102512,sw3232,sv,it 's really a bad situation here .
210271,sw2370,sv,"the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases , young college ."
152292,sw2171,sv,they could n't cover my hourly rate .
159842,sw2504,sv,"But , uh , everything should be started on the lower levels"
3615,sw2638,sv,"it 's like , uh , going down to get your license and checking your eyes ."
133400,sw2387,sv,"Well , we 'll have to keep up with that then ."
205669,sw4908,sv,"I , I think it should be , i- , it should go to the , to the heart of the matter though and say , okay guy ,"
194830,sw4129,sv,but I guess --
107577,sw3596,sv,"-- and that 's , that 's a fun th- ,"
62334,sw2051,sv,They ca n't be accepted into society .
175531,sw2331,sv,"but you play with the same people , you , you are n't going to learn anything ."
203659,sw2837,sv,I bet Dursban would do it .
51073,sw3014,sv,"Actually I think probably if I were going to get a- , if I were going to be practical , which does n't mean I would be ,"
127486,sw2726,sv,"For , for Waco"
48066,sw2744,sv,"Now , a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that 's socialism"
40977,sw3570,sv,I do n't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives .
67226,sw4618,sv,"You know , as a health professional , I would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs ."
74053,sw2502,sv,"That 's good , in a way ."
154290,sw3776,sv,"you must see kids with real significant problems , uh , in some cases ."
16896,sw3738,sv,"-- learn how to adapt ,"
208858,sw3801,sv,"that 's the worst neighborhood in the whole c- , area ."
161873,sw2820,sv,I would n't worry about that .
107800,sw2992,sv,"well , and here lately it has n't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high ."
183485,sw4048,sv,"Well , especially around , uh , you know , equipment , machinery and stuff ."
201790,sw4370,sv,but I do n't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment --
116473,sw2287,sv,they do n't .
5944,sw3228,sv,"Some of it just is n't ,"
177332,sw2062,sv,"And the paid time off is wonderful ,"
18560,sw3379,sv,"But then there 's that side of me that says , yeah ,"
108405,sw3225,sv,"but it 's , it 's very good ."
33404,sw3198,sv,"So ,"
24312,sw3247,sv,I do n't see any sense in someone living that does things like that .
132417,sw2663,sv,I think the reason why we 've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules .
17307,sw2191,sv,"you can relax that way ,"
11338,sw3055,sv,"and it is buys you time to do other things , like have a dinner party , I guess ."
170391,sw4347,sv,"uh , th- , they keep up c- , with it pretty quickly"
39209,sw2693,sv,you have to watch that too .
69243,sw2617,sv,"Uh , I think that maybe we 're not their big bad enemy any more ."
126318,sw2927,sv,I really do think that 's part of it .
107940,sw2065,sv,but I think it would be a great idea .
66821,sw4659,sv,and not that many people are really trying I do n't think .
37105,sw3270,sv,-- but I 'm not sure that that 's really that much of the problem .
57275,sw2237,sv,and you get them back again .
198515,sw2061,sv,It 's pretty tough .
108220,sw3537,sv,"I , I think the medical profession is just , just pushing until there 's no option but the government take it over"
186192,sw4082,sv,"I , I have a problem with their viewpoint"
179227,sw2568,sv,"I just did n't find that one to be real ,"
83838,sw4376,sv,"But one way of doing it is , uh , by income ."
117932,sw3353,sv,"there 's a Tyler State Park that 's , uh , really a nice camping area ,"
159840,sw2504,sv,and then it 's too late to try to change them around at that point .
3368,sw2614,sv,"Uh , and I think a lot of their problems is poverty ."
72412,sw2295,sv,"-- that 's like everything else , though ."
143833,sw2157,sv,"well , the Cowboys were th- , America 's football team ,"
46535,sw3747,sv,"They are , the two of them are mainly pretty much the , they have cornered the market on trumpet ."
80278,sw2151,sv,"There are very few Scouts go on ,"
14110,sw3326,sv,"I , I think so , too ."
159868,sw2504,sv,"If they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them , okay now you 're not going to get to vote"
77433,sw3074,sv,"you , you , you ca n't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- , work ou- , out ."
49933,sw2862,sv,"Uh , and it also helps when they were winning ."
52329,sw2803,sv,"and I think that anybody that works in the , in some kind of service or for the community or something ,"
183719,sw4380,sv,So I guess I ca n't really --
44707,sw4655,sv,"but hopefully , they have ."
71361,sw2041,sv,"Well , do n't you think a lot of that is diet too ?"
168509,sw2826,sv,"And you worry when ,"
181803,sw3633,sv,"Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee ,"
88214,sw3115,sv,"Well , it 's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run , I think , that you do n't have to be concerned about your wardrobe ."
74915,sw2160,sv,and you 're driving back home
63051,sw2455,sv,it 's a very personal thing .
71322,sw2041,sv,"and , before long , you , you get this , this whole kind of Gestalt , this whole package of , of health , of health care and options --"
88584,sw2039,sv,Surely we 've made it .
85859,sw2421,sv,"For example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going ,"
59675,sw2344,sv,"I mean , and it , it might be something that he would n't be able to control ."
124173,sw3777,sv,"It , it seems to be kind of halfway between , uh , something like ALL IN THE FAMILY and , uh , HILL STREET BLUES ."
15912,sw2953,sv,That --
134735,sw2875,sv,"you ca n't tell one Japanese car from the other ,"
99317,sw3615,sv,"In fact in , I think if people would learn to turn off the T V -s"
18098,sw2303,sv,"but I think they 'll wind up like us at some point , where people sort of , only half of them will end up voting , and sort of caring enough to really make a statement ,"
84379,sw2382,sv,flex time is great .
68085,sw2032,sv,"but ,"
17862,sw3282,sv,"But , um , we definitely need something there with all the hostages and --"
13248,sw3500,sv,they are --
14874,sw2709,sv,"And it 's k- , it really is kind of scary because there 's , there 's just oodles of them ."
173726,sw3809,sv,"Also , I think , uh , a good argument for that is in the area of politics , you know ,"
199159,sw2539,sv,"we need more parents willing to supervise ,"
62359,sw2051,sv,"or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than killing them , you know ,"
72140,sw3576,sv,There 's nothing like them .
6932,sw3019,sv,"but I would prefer to find , a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians ."
110626,sw2849,sv,"that 's interesting the , the way , term you used continentals , which I 'm sure is the proper term ."
24037,sw3244,sv,"and , um --"
163484,sw2909,sv,"I , I , I think that certainly is a problem ."
193152,sw3580,sv,"Some crazy hit man over there so ,"
154182,sw4720,sv,"and , uh , and yet anybody who 's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up ."
135920,sw4856,sv,but I think it 's something that needs to stay .
155449,sw2488,sv,"I think there 's a point ,"
120376,sw4707,sv,"I think in places ,"
208286,sw2290,sv,That would have been something .
119604,sw2797,sv,"and it , you know , it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain , a drain ."
131304,sw3063,sv,"Then we get out of that phase ,"
104914,sw2938,sv,it 's probably a lot worse now .
181980,sw3284,sv,And that 's not the kind of society we have right now .
47821,sw3118,sv,"a lot of times , uh , the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury"
118940,sw2537,sv,"There 's a lot of different things that , uh , come into play"
45841,sw2662,sv,And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it .
147580,sw3784,sv,"You know , but that 's another issue altogether ."
156534,sw3360,sv,"And then when you read about that they 're spending all the money on , you know , these studies that have no relevance whatsoever , that kind of ticks you off , too ."
107713,sw2992,sv,"that 's true ,"
72843,sw3606,sv,I think that 's kind of a good show .
49252,sw2228,sv,"so I guess I , I feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems ."
169344,sw3099,sv,"so it , you know , it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place ."
138006,sw3870,sv,"So , I think the evolution will be interesting ."
146732,sw3269,sv,"Well , there is so much about it --"
105435,sw3355,sv,"-- and I , I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too , it does n't disturb them and --"
141896,sw3002,sv,"There 's no competition , so what you get is what you get ."
58215,sw2340,sv,"You know , sometimes that even helps them , just being around young people to , because some of them are so , um , just stationary --"
138028,sw3870,sv,"Uh , it all depends upon the way you structure the environment ."
6403,sw2308,sv,"And that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants , they end up being put in homes ,"
201523,sw3140,sv,"Like a lot ,"
6334,sw2308,sv,"it really concerns me , that , um , first of all , that anyone could let someone live like that ,"
116372,sw2287,sv,-- I think that discourages a lot of people .
159897,sw2504,sv,"-- you know , it 's going to take the , uh , a whole generation of my feeling , uh , before that 's going to be accomplished ."
203778,sw2604,sv,"Something that they turn ,"
214394,sw2611,sv,"you know , that 's a good way to approach it ."
43910,sw2995,sv,"that 's , you know , that 's the problem ."
131375,sw3063,sv,"I mean , every human being that lives is a contributor ,"
77469,sw3074,sv,"you know , people did n't like him ."
169112,sw2316,sv,if the industry comes --
45487,sw3946,sv,"but the cost of these nursing homes are so ,"
46346,sw2413,sv,"But apparently , he 's a , a worker ."
50411,sw3151,sv,I guess it is possible to have a false positive report .
173600,sw4113,sv,"Uh , I think , I think there really is a , there 's a lot they need to learn , you know , when you get there ."
117335,sw2642,sv,and they would n't even think of it
48855,sw2149,sv,"I mean ,"
60522,sw2433,sv,Exercise is not supposed to do that to you .
149299,sw4936,sv,So .
190747,sw3658,sv,"I think it 's a trend that 's , that 's , that 's , uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need ."
55999,sw2994,sv,"And I know a lot of people it would , would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup"
207992,sw3369,sv,"but you can watch the characters develop ,"
152331,sw2171,sv,"it 's for , I think , at the same it 's for some people to , you know , help them grow in other areas ,"
131265,sw3063,sv,"I think they would generate probably , uh , one of them would probably generate enough for three cars ."
191825,sw4327,sv,I 've nailed the problem down
118896,sw2537,sv,"but I still think there 's a lot of , there 's a lot of resentment ."
196232,sw4333,sv,"I do know that , uh , politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths ."
145249,sw2641,sv,"But they 're not that much fun , you know ,"
192809,sw2109,sv,"that , it 's good because it does make you think , about your own family ."
169121,sw2316,sv,You hope .
79421,sw3638,sv,"let 's , let 's dump him ."
122657,sw4752,sv,"and it seems , seems as though the , the system does n't cha- , tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done ."
56395,sw2227,sv,"TWILIGHT ZONE rules , man ."
113166,sw3421,sv,really good ending --
91577,sw2285,sv,you can be better than that .
20234,sw2478,sv,"You do n't sound like a nonexempt , Jim ."
179724,sw4801,sv,"I , yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little , little too lenient ."
194327,sw2451,sv,"I think it 's , I think it 's a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it ? , bureaucracy and , and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption ."
86915,sw3150,sv,"And trying to rehabilitate him , too ,"
118727,sw2900,sv,"Uh , I guess my feelings are that , uh , we almost have a universal health care system , uh , to a great degree , except that now I read where we 've left out about thirty-four million people ."
202061,sw2477,sv,"and that , and that , so that 's a terrible time to have to deal with that , right in , when it , when it counts so much ."
154223,sw4720,sv,You have to have an awful lot of fun
50482,sw3151,sv,"It 's , it 's kind of hard to"
100040,sw3182,sv,That sounds so interesting .
56056,sw2994,sv,I think it 's a good reason to quit buying it .
86741,sw2302,sv,"You know , kind of MUMBLEx off what we 've been talking about here , uh , I believe that our , we 've become almost a litigious society where we , everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff ,"
168548,sw2826,sv,"I always thought too that , you know , people worrying about going to work when their child , when their children are little"
104302,sw4056,sv,"-- but I 'm not sure that 's , that 's widely followed any more ."
50718,sw4681,sv,They wo n't be able to pay it
27764,sw2557,sv,But still sort of up in that general --
42974,sw3810,sv,-- that 's for sure .
34202,sw2190,sv,"you consider how much , um ,"
133084,sw2301,sv,"Course , there are emergencies , you know , that you , you know , probably need to have a card ."
87026,sw3150,sv,"if they had more money or more , more resources to work more on rehabilitation ,"
198255,sw3083,sv,"because , you know , even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when , uh , when , when you 're growing up in , you know , in a home which may be , uh , just the pits ,"
86592,sw2657,sv,"you know , they , they 'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat ."
161723,sw2820,sv,"I think , you know ,"
155615,sw2488,sv,"Never be the same ,"
195659,sw4320,sv,"and it 's , uh , really scary sometimes ."
41644,sw2942,sv,"And it 's ,"
88442,sw2039,sv,"Whereas , uh , Sean Connery has maintained the , uh , how would you , uh , ruddy look ,"
28367,sw4822,sv,"Uh , they 're , they 're going to be doing a lot of interesting things ."
13174,sw4630,sv,"I suppose you watch for huri- , hurricanes coming in and --"
15731,sw2953,sv,"And women 's rights , I mean , things for women were totally different for you by that time ."
86311,sw2479,sv,"I think that 's really important ,"
211313,sw2060,sv,"you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got , you know ."
23285,sw2959,sv,"Well , they are probably not doing very well at all ."
80508,sw2461,sv,"an , and if they go to their friends dealing drugs , they 're going to be in even worse shape ."
19802,sw3001,sv,"After you 've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go , is that all that 's in there ."
116413,sw2287,sv,that would be .
93863,sw3023,sv,we have got a lot of that influence .
207266,sw3796,sv,Good move .
162177,sw2897,sv,"Um , but , you know I suppose some places are , are more stringent about that than others ."
179952,sw2640,sv,"So , anyway , well , we all agree ."
119065,sw3898,sv,"But the kids ,"
194828,sw4129,sv,we 'd have fewer decisions to make .
9448,sw2871,sv,"I think movies are losing their attractiveness , just to a lot of people ."
6210,sw2684,sv,"I , I would like to see the money that 's been budgeted , budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of , of alternate solutions to the problem ."
78076,sw2609,sv,"you know , that 's , that 's , that 's why we hire people who , uh , you know , to , to make these decisions for us ."
67590,sw2383,sv,"and , uh , I think that 's the main problem at this point ."
149315,sw4936,sv,"And , uh ,"
147028,sw3103,sv,"And , uh , I think things are changing ,"
161734,sw2820,sv,"I think it may be pushing people , hopefully push people away from drug use ,"
1192,sw4666,sv,People are pretty excited about it .
97394,sw3403,sv,"You know , you like to have someone like that you could point to say , see what a fine man , that , he is ."
66980,sw3294,sv,"-- uh , and you do n't know where it 's going to end ."
45892,sw2662,sv,"so it , it was a strange combination ."
88295,sw4859,sv,"That 's , that 's potential indication of balance ."
128417,sw3911,sv,"Well I am sure it was , you know ."
162690,sw2921,sv,but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live --
47843,sw3118,sv,"You know , so it , it 's , I , I think , I think in , in the end , the judge has the presiding , you know , uh , vote ."
105744,sw2616,sv,"And then , the United States has this attitude by saying , you know , thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that ."
181783,sw2896,sv,"Well , of course that 's the other advantage of paint ."
176165,sw4697,sv,"But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to , to clients unless they feel they can , you know , tweak a jury into --"
12528,sw2594,sv,"So , I think that , that became ,"
14872,sw2709,sv,"and the , the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up ."
71362,sw2041,sv,"and , a lot of that is diet ."
98610,sw3088,sv,"And in the long run , we 're all paying for that --"
180940,sw2667,sv,it gives you energy .
33777,sw2386,sv,"Well that could ,"
111662,sw3097,sv,"That way husbands are crippled ,"
47992,sw2744,sv,"and you 've got to let those , you know , those ,"
22831,sw2621,sv,"And Warren Moon ,"
41029,sw3570,sv,"Well , maybe I need to run out there this weekend ."
103150,sw2197,sv,"it 's ki- , I find it kind of sad ,"
56080,sw4745,sv,"So , you know , if you do have any time , it 's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done , uh , ju- , just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then , plus try to have that relationship with your children ,"
170371,sw4347,sv,"maybe they 're starting to get a clue . Uh ,"
2468,sw4774,sv,"And then they , you know , caught everybody ."
120153,sw3090,sv,"if it had not been for my wife , I would have probably been in debtor 's prison ,"
103045,sw2197,sv,"-- uh , it , it depends on the person ,"
75438,sw2870,sv,"They kind of say , well what do you want me to believe ."
162100,sw3533,sv,"When , when your own children are growing up , you just take them for granted"
6182,sw2684,sv,And these people have not benefited from the stay there .
128893,sw3429,sv,I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be .
191806,sw4327,sv,The judicial system is aimed at the citizens
188700,sw4060,sv,"it 's where it 's most expedient which ,"
49589,sw4644,sv,they just do n't have the money or just feel that there is n't the need for it .
65851,sw4023,sv,"and , uh , --"
41719,sw2942,sv,"It , it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier ."
23618,sw3214,sv,they said about magazines .
187619,sw3135,sv,"that is , uh , a big drawback I think in that , in the , uh , public schools out here ."
212195,sw3266,sv,"You would have to be able to have enough ,"
33594,sw3077,sv,and the ones that get the most pay do the least work .
157102,sw2571,sv,"but , that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow ."
127879,sw4927,sv,"He 's , he 's helped out in a lot of ways ."
131770,sw3535,sv,they try to stay in office .
27768,sw2557,sv,-- so you can probably see them sometimes .
95761,sw3235,sv,"Well , you know , it 's interesting , because when I heard the topic , I was thinking , uh ,"
45510,sw3946,sv,and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow .
88481,sw2039,sv,"And it should ,"
109127,sw2893,sv,Well you can gain too much weight .
32000,sw2205,sv,and that 's interesting .
196303,sw4333,sv,at least at the end .
195994,sw2775,sv,"In a big city like that most houses , I would think , would be sort of like what we live in . Just a you know , basic tract house ."
177157,sw4886,sv,"I do n't know about Dallas , but arou- , even in this little town , it 's , it 's not cheap at all ."
172948,sw2525,sv,I mean they go right back where they came from .
136017,sw3802,sv,but you still have to --
39701,sw2935,sv,"I think , really to get out there and dig in the dirt ,"
212008,sw2107,sv,but they 're a lot more trouble than cats actually .
201825,sw4370,sv,They get too boring .
96165,sw3387,sv,"I mean right now lobbyists require to register you 'd just say ,"
125432,sw2631,sv,"I think that 's really , that 's important"
68373,sw3333,sv,and it just continues to get worse .
151860,sw2012,sv,"and so ,"
91267,sw2540,sv,"And , so , I think that kind of control is , would be good ,"
4510,sw2168,sv,"Well , you know , the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it tak- , that it took to contest the , the football , um , issue ."
193256,sw3156,sv,"and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash , you know --"
195066,sw4181,sv,"but I really feel that , that I 'm just getting overtaxed ."
150209,sw2956,sv,it just was not effective enough to ...
192241,sw3227,sv,"that 's not ,"
165664,sw2634,sv,they 'll get it
211617,sw3925,sv,a lot of times I think it 's our own fault .
95028,sw2435,sv,I think they did a real good job of that .
47047,sw2552,sv,"You can at least say that it 's important to our country ,"
12851,sw2776,sv,"And , uh , you know , if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer , well , then I 'll around a lot longer ,"
61232,sw2124,sv,but it 's real hard to make them .
27160,sw2821,sv,"It was one of these you have bad experience and ,"
109219,sw2893,sv,"And it , it just makes stuff move down ."
80502,sw2461,sv,"You got to , you got to be your child 's best friend , I guess ,"
59303,sw3107,sv,"and , if , if you do n't work for somebody that 's got enough clout to , to , uh , uh , give you , you know , give you these rates and make this agreement --"
119857,sw2283,sv,"And people who do have them ,"
81967,sw2441,sv,"They 've , they 've relinquished their parenting ."
82668,sw2131,sv,"and they 're just so thin and ,"
77076,sw2734,sv,"it 's a deterrent to crime ,"
96290,sw4138,sv,"and what I mean by that , the more income you make , the more tax you pay ."
73291,sw3750,sv,"Like I said , we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas ."
194394,sw2451,sv,and I just do n't feel that ...
155977,sw3447,sv,"so this was n't necessarily a big conversation ,"
155943,sw3447,sv,"and then there 's kind of the , the branch manager level --"
36272,sw2389,sv,Or they wo n't be as good as they could be .
119165,sw3898,sv,"When you find the right cookbook , why it works out ."
67055,sw4022,sv,"because , in my opinion , I do n't think I 'm ever going to see any of this peace , so-called peace dividend ."
54062,sw2780,sv,"So , it really is a different , um ,"
157509,sw3021,sv,but there 's an element that ca n't .
189327,sw3902,sv,Most people are n't .
151435,sw3047,sv,"Uh , depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford , different things like that ,"
83092,sw2703,sv,"you 're , you 're aware of that kind of thing ."
154899,sw2584,sv,"So , i- , i- , if I have one , it must be very , very slight ."
191864,sw4327,sv,and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it
77293,sw3074,sv,"but would n't it be mu- , much nicer if we all did it ,"
95557,sw2819,sv,"I , I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse ,"
93129,sw2598,sv,It was not bad
212758,sw2018,sv,"And that 's a real attractive option , if you have the , the technology for it ."
115118,sw2887,sv,"That 's a , that 's a fortunate benefit , you know , that they 're so active --"
153102,sw4130,sv,"Um , well , that 's , but that 's why they should have s , started doing stuff before ."
185552,sw4362,sv,"you can compare just about everyth- , thing to Japan"
59314,sw3107,sv,"uh , and , but it , but it 's the , the same , the effect is the same as the ,"
173487,sw3275,sv,but that 's a lot of pain and hassle .
182250,sw2554,sv,and a lot of them are going back there .
157424,sw2407,sv,"and I think , you know , you have to teach how to write an answer and , you know , how to construct a thought process ."
173196,sw3417,sv,"Um , one thing that has kept our tax burden high , and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the , is the level of def- , of the defense budget --"
178180,sw2658,sv,"Starts with the one person that , you know ,"
90356,sw4071,sv,MUMBLEx I mean there 's plans there
73128,sw3639,sv,"Mississippi probably does n't ,"
103900,sw3504,sv,"Because they 've got the hitting ,"
212725,sw2018,sv,"or the way you look ,"
9798,sw2716,sv,"but I , I 'm really leery of a , kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan , because I just feel like everything that the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly"
157647,sw3021,sv,"but ,"
183885,sw4334,sv,"and it would be considered good because it 's Madonna , you know ."
27910,sw2557,sv,that would n't be so bad .
151790,sw2589,sv,"Let 's put him into a situation where , okay , you crossed the line , you broke the rule , you 're going to have to pay for it ."
195609,sw4320,sv,"Uh , but it 's on the uprise , especially in a lot of the , uh , outlying agricultural towns ."
82671,sw2131,sv,"and they just , they 're not meant to last ,"
174688,sw2558,sv,Plus the training involved .
59847,sw2344,sv,I really do n't .
195324,sw4378,sv,they usually most of the time do n't open very well .
156704,sw4064,sv,"Uh , this is a little bit of the subject ,"
44,sw3743,sv,"If they did n't have ,"
112940,sw2579,sv,"So it ,"
93112,sw2598,sv,"That wa , that was pretty good ."
135131,sw3563,sv,I guess I 'm probably a lot like you .
201425,sw4736,sv,"But the , uh , I , I really feel that , that the law enforcement community , uh , you know , puts these people behind bars"
166477,sw2860,sv,"and I do n't think it needs to be the mothers ,"
45654,sw3770,sv,If you can afford them .
126599,sw3464,sv,The cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music .
102592,sw3279,sv,"If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic , you know , inter , intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might ."
67287,sw2260,sv,"and the county adds theirs ,"
142650,sw3646,sv,"A hundred per grade , that 's a good size ."
184556,sw4346,sv,"it 's great ,"
213307,sw3142,sv,but it 's not nice when they 're too attentive .
22186,sw2960,sv,"Oh , that is a fun show ."
6063,sw2684,sv,"Well , it sounds like you have really strong views on it ."
137423,sw3591,sv,"There is a lot the community , the community can do to , uh , enhance the , or , or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home ."
185351,sw4108,sv,and they do n't want to take the responsibility
110306,sw3449,sv,"It 's a , , it 's not a tiny area . Uh ,"
127989,sw3556,sv,They just did an excellent job .
96114,sw4876,sv,but then there are baby-sitting groups .
176969,sw2998,sv,"But , uh , again , uh , that did n't occur without a crisis ."
152509,sw3524,sv,"Oh , boy , you have a lot of kids ."
144406,sw4032,sv,but now bench or step aerobics have --
130267,sw3036,sv,"You know , so , well , I think there 's music all around anyway ."
173035,sw2525,sv,"I mean , we educate them ,"
161349,sw3693,sv,so --
101268,sw2073,sv,"they , I think they look at it as , well everybody , the majority of the people think this way , when that 's not necessarily true ,"
59356,sw3692,sv,"you reduce the deficit ,"
120337,sw4707,sv,"I suppose that 's true ,"
51553,sw2610,sv,"I think they 've got , I think there are more pressing problems ."
108026,sw2065,sv,that 's true .
63493,sw3051,sv,"Now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for , uh , brand new ,"
175311,sw2970,sv,"And you are like , why are they repeating ?"
6042,sw3265,sv,Six thousand is just getting broken in for them .
190585,sw4148,sv,"You , you would hope that if you were in that situation that you 'd have the moral fortitude , uh , to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response ."
38028,sw2426,sv,"Now , now we are a , uh , a legitimate player ,"
90543,sw2366,sv,"In order to continue to , to grow and"
194679,sw3154,sv,"seems like there 's a pretty well , there 's a p- , pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics --"
43519,sw2263,sv,-- just set it up
141975,sw3002,sv,"and I thought it was really , well I do n't know , asinine actually ."
195347,sw2546,sv,"My belief all my life , I guess , has been that , that if you take someone else 's life , then you automatically are giving up , uh , yours in place of it ."
190481,sw4318,sv,"-- and that was , I think , what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality , uh , car ."
64259,sw3525,sv,"Spend more time on the ,"
13324,sw3500,sv,"but , you 're not likely to find somebody who is going to , you know , have a less conscientious effort ."
207478,sw3838,sv,and they have a way of dragging you back home .
77352,sw3074,sv,"Well , it 's for everybody 's benefit ."
172491,sw3085,sv,"-- but still they have an op- , an opportunity to be with other children --"
213912,sw3134,sv,"Uh , I would imagine that we 've talked the amount of time necessary ."
107412,sw3381,sv,"If you want to stop the crime , I think you 've got to get , uh , the people when they are kids ."
26381,sw3013,sv,"Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference ,"
186999,sw4325,sv,"It would be hard ,"
133805,sw2235,sv,"That 's a big laugh ,"
24802,sw2623,sv,it 's my feeling that if you do n't have a role model to follow --
139265,sw2630,sv,That 's still pretty far though .
188500,sw3917,sv,I think it 's great .
59100,sw3489,sv,"You can be , uh , get in trouble for that ."
111429,sw3097,sv,our families have changed .
35024,sw2957,sv,"and I guess , you know , when you stop to think of it , these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they 've needed all their lives ."
46213,sw3104,sv,"And there 's nothing wrong with that , you know , if ,"
65480,sw2010,sv,"The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics ,"
136732,sw3431,sv,"They 're , they 're pretty well refined today --"
50348,sw2917,sv,very personal .
46380,sw2413,sv,"I think it 's , it 's kind of interesting that everybody 's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done ."
120456,sw3143,sv,Maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes .
9799,sw2716,sv,and it is going to be about six times more expensive .
97474,sw3503,sv,so --
56995,sw2237,sv,it 's a lot of work --
179477,sw2568,sv,"I mean it was all right ,"
196296,sw4333,sv,"The- , the- , there has to be some way to do it ."
210732,sw3138,sv,"and you can even ,"
207020,sw3201,sv,They may be coming out ahead .
61832,sw3746,sv,"Well , you need to , uh , teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you ."

129592,sw2926,sv,"It 's , it 's amazing the way ,"
192040,sw2789,sv,there are things I should do .
56184,sw4745,sv,"-- I think with working moms , if you can get them ma- , the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they 're going to do with year-round school where you work ,"
115226,sw2887,sv,"it 's slow , though ."
83823,sw4376,sv,"Well , one of the things I was thinking about is , uh , you know , from society 's point of view , if you put a value on each person , what you want to do is to maximize the end game value ."
103066,sw2197,sv,"I think if there 's any major piece of advice I 'd give , is to find a way of getting an education that does n't incur that kind of debt ."
161238,sw3332,sv,"well , I see that as an advantage to a credit card , also --"
65107,sw2533,sv,"I mean , goll- , how humiliating for a man to do that , any man ."
54763,sw2175,sv,"I mean , you 're , you 're participating ,"
79697,sw2324,sv,"and it 's , it 's not in our national consciousness to do it ."
27391,sw2723,sv,"Course there 's a few things that , uh , I think I could do better if I was sitting up in the C E O 's seat"
167655,sw2615,sv,"Well that was , uh , that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up ."
131162,sw3018,sv,it 's pretty slow .
504,sw2278,sv,"Those are , those are , uh , I think those are more fun than major league games sometimes ."
70139,sw2486,sv,"But , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able to , uh , put out as guidelines for their employees ."
82482,sw2131,sv,they 're good .
169663,sw3256,sv,"unless they 're caught in the act or the- , the- , the child is very badly , you know , beaten up , it comes down to a one word against the other --"

66076,sw2913,sv,That 's good .
155013,sw2584,sv,"I mean , I just do n't understand these people that think taking an R V ,"
196583,sw3133,sv,"and I , uh , I , I think it gives you a better perspective ,"
194550,sw4619,sv,"but again , um , it must be depressing for the people who , who are , who are just e- , e- , essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but , but , certainly , uh , certainly have ar , ar , are , have retained all of their , uh , mental skills and so on ."
106369,sw2806,sv,"they 're so independent ,"

60174,sw2773,sv,"But , I 'm not for sure we know exactly what , what all happened in that situation ,"
186229,sw4082,sv,"I know of cases where , uh , we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but , with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they 're talking about is the same thing they are showing you ."
3373,sw2614,sv,"There , there 's so much down in all of South America , uh , so much potential , you know ,"
147417,sw2490,sv,"If it , if it 's just one more piece of something ,"
18729,sw4703,sv,"and th- , the only thing that I would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on ."
184479,sw4028,sv,"but if you , you know , have a family and , and , um , everybody 's gone to different doctors , uh , it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your , just has , you know , all the medical history"
150212,sw2956,sv,And indeed his trend started upward .
73244,sw3750,sv,"And , you know , in those those kinds of situations , uh , room rent which is outrageous ."
50058,sw2862,sv,"God . That 's a , that 's a lot ."
203109,sw2429,sv,Um You know I 'm sure that dinner parties will

3562,sw2638,sv,"Um , of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world , too ."
109933,sw3283,sv,"and , and you know , but the way the courts are set up they 've , they 've got so many chances for appeal ,"
61233,sw2124,sv,"They do n't really come out like they do in New Orleans , up here ,"

26640,sw2064,sv,"someone is calling for someone else to be killed , you know ."

206426,sw3152,sv,"it 's kind of haunting , you know , on , on some of the notes ."
160750,sw2262,sv,Plus all the problems in the Middle East .
42821,sw2839,sv,and they need to start another one .

188675,sw4060,sv,"Well , you know that 's interesting though ."
119998,sw3926,sv,And I do n't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge did n't have the final say .
155714,sw2349,sv,a super do salary of any kind .
144034,sw2492,sv,and he 's kind of like your wife .

178182,sw2658,sv,Little value just in whatever you do .
74533,sw2800,sv,"they 're going to get cards at the ,"
38958,sw2968,sv,"you can , you can page through it in ,"
4545,sw2168,sv,"now that 's sad , when there 's supposed to be what , you know , one thousand , what , sixty-five dollars , something like that , spent on each pupil ."
184114,sw4319,sv,"Uh , but it 's , you know , it 's , it 's okay ."

21707,sw2437,sv,"that 's a good point ,"

85941,sw2421,sv,"Well , the limits , uh , uh , would , I think , have to do with what I 'd alluded to before , that there needs to be a further , um , that , that one positive on a drug test ,"
126628,sw3464,sv,"it 's funny because most women are n't really ,"
41652,sw2942,sv,"or , or , or , or some other thought provoking area , you know ."
207571,sw3838,sv,"It 's , uh , funny that you said ."
5807,sw3228,sv,I hope he stays cute --
116182,sw2424,sv,"I mean , I can see paying the interest and some small penalty"
24946,sw3162,sv,Trying to find a jury --
86529,sw2657,sv,"I think that is an excellent program ,"
203887,sw2604,sv,I 'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way .
135208,sw3563,sv,"And they have just done as much as they can for that man ,"
152889,sw4483,sv,"And , uh , it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do , what --"
129991,sw2110,sv,"that would be neat ,"
163574,sw2909,sv,"You know , maybe it will average out ,"
212707,sw2018,sv,"Hopefully , the next generation , it wo n't even be an issue ,"
213286,sw3142,sv,"Well I think that it 's just , that 's ex ,"
183046,sw4358,sv,that 's the majority of people that I know of anyways .
191762,sw4104,sv,"and I , it just amazes me that the French do n't recognize that ."
207639,sw3146,sv,"Oh , it is , it 's fabulous ."
25444,sw2495,sv,"I tell you what , the fumes that the , the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any- ,"
192843,sw2109,sv,He did great .
97012,sw2314,sv,"I do n't think they can , they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I , I --"
195528,sw4109,sv,"-- and it , it 's too costly"
68372,sw3333,sv,"it 's been out of hand , I think , for a while ,"
6228,sw2684,sv,"But it , it sounds like you are , uh , you know ,"
80834,sw2121,sv,"But I , I thought it was up there ."
198958,sw4090,sv,That 's a good feeling .
143712,sw2157,sv,he 's been doing real good .
196382,sw2095,sv,"it 's just not very comfortable ,"
73337,sw3750,sv,A little bit in the world .
104054,sw3049,sv,"And , you know , the second time you see it , you understand more subtleties in it ."
93145,sw2598,sv,"So , it 's um , it was , it was a fun movie ."
184239,sw3073,sv,that 's always a bummer too .
64238,sw3525,sv,"you , you need to play that often --"
186727,sw4321,sv,"but in civil cases , I think a majority rule by , by jury would be sufficient ."
142717,sw3646,sv,and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands .
158460,sw2608,sv,"You know ,"
131400,sw3063,sv,"Well , I think science has come a long way to making it so that it 's possible to find ways to solve the problem ."
96311,sw4138,sv,"there 's a lot , yeah , lot of hidden taxes ."
119952,sw3926,sv,and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life --
8952,sw2354,sv,"The problem is that I 've , that I 've read books that ,"
62410,sw2051,sv,Because that 's what our society becomes .
201907,sw4765,sv,"I , I must admit that the production costs of , of these drugs are , are zippo compared to the street market costs and , and the costs to society ,"
90764,sw2252,sv,But it 's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period .
7239,sw3676,sv,"But when you first came out , you were n't real sure ."
153981,sw2154,sv,Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done .
109215,sw2893,sv,"It 's probably , I would think it would be hard on your , your legs and your joints and stuff ."
132482,sw2663,sv,"and then they do n't even do that recommendation , you know ."
203310,sw3120,sv,"Well , it sounds like he 's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants to do ."
168310,sw3068,sv,and technical people know that .
124186,sw3777,sv,he 's tender hearted fellow .
201570,sw3140,sv,"well that , that , I mean that 's very , young for a baby ."
185881,sw2945,sv,"if you want to do something every night that 's fine ,"
207855,sw3146,sv,"but the atmosphere and service I think , are important , uh --"
20037,sw3054,sv,"so it 's , it 's really quite pretty ."
184782,sw3830,sv,and it is unbelievable --
183831,sw4334,sv,"Way , way more than I can stand down here ."
107790,sw2992,sv,I mean I just think they watch so much more T V .
189139,sw4329,sv,more than it 's worth .
204675,sw2749,sv,"and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they do n't want to do it ,"
168474,sw2826,sv,"And you ca n't make up in a classroom of one hour a day ,"
39448,sw2693,sv,And I think that 's a shame .
152642,sw3524,sv,We do n't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning .
135521,sw2586,sv,"Well , that sounds like fun ."
85977,sw2421,sv,"it 's not feasible to do everyone ,"
185157,sw3506,sv,"That sounds good , too ."
142705,sw3646,sv,I think that 's wrong .
159365,sw2035,sv,"and phone calls that 's about , about it ."
202696,sw3219,sv,I 'm sure they are there .
190544,sw4148,sv,"And I , I do n't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal ."
117439,sw2642,sv,"And then you never feel like you 've got anything to p , to put into savings or anything ,"
103372,sw4149,sv,"I , I guess I should have specified ,"
201754,sw4370,sv,and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to .
159023,sw2526,sv,"that 's one reason I went with it because I , Subaru had a good reputation , uh , for , you know , low maintenance ,"
127859,sw4927,sv,And you do n't want them sent off to the Middle East to --
70185,sw2486,sv,"That 's , uh , can stifle creativity ."
10103,sw2716,sv,"Oh , that could be , uh , making up for the difference ."
190097,sw4372,sv,"Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity f- , to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided ."
127788,sw4927,sv,"You know , if someone were studying something , MUMBLEx take something obscure . Somebody was studying economics , the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country ."
125685,sw3071,sv,"I , I think that the piano background is very , um , useful ,"
212244,sw3266,sv,"Babies are fun ,"
59193,sw3107,sv,"That 's a , that 's a , a tough one ."
190540,sw4148,sv,"and things that are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require ,"
68488,sw3333,sv,that 's not doing anything .
35757,sw2679,sv,It is absolutely delicious .
25728,sw2898,sv,"Uh , they 're high scoring ,"
15980,sw2953,sv,"We do not know ,"
32843,sw3016,sv,"you know , I think it 's more safety than anything else ."
129981,sw2110,sv,So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country .
83130,sw2703,sv,They 're great .
179642,sw4801,sv,"Well , I think first degree murder , uh , probably warrants it ."
87617,sw2020,sv,They destroyed it .
184241,sw3073,sv,Sometimes it 's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one .
4693,sw2711,sv,"Oh , that 's tough ."
28679,sw2924,sv,"they wo n't say yes and they wo n't say no to just certain issues just because they do n't know what the public wants , or the public 's split on it ."
75688,sw3574,sv,"maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in , uh , uh , some more beautiful parts of the country , uh , I think that , that , uh , we become a little more aware , uh , rather quickly of , of what 's happening with air pollution and how , uh , how horrible it really is ."
166521,sw2860,sv,You do n't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles .
172028,sw3325,sv,but they do dig up
64128,sw4363,sv,Rugby is definitely big in college
204758,sw2749,sv,"The , the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will , you know , want to hang everyone ,"
185368,sw4108,sv,"it 's there 's not a choice , it 's --"
80951,sw2121,sv,But it should n't be too hard to do something like that .
132880,sw4443,sv,that 's a good thing .
136102,sw3802,sv,But it 's fun .
201467,sw4736,sv,"So , I , I , I mean as , as man has gotten more complicated so all of the , uh , imaginations to , uh , you know , protect him from , from being , uh , dumped on by , uh , civilian authority in , in so- , in criminal actions , especially , you know , murder cases and that sort of thing ."
138863,sw2086,sv,A lot of people are eating healthier now a days .
165497,sw2717,sv,"I do n't think much of li- , of life imprisonment . First of all , it 's never , turns out to be life ,"
129872,sw2736,sv,"So , I mean , it , it kind of gives you a false sense of security ."
121428,sw2027,sv,"but it 's true , you know ,"
153892,sw2005,sv,"And ,"
25999,sw2967,sv,"And a lot of times it is added for no real , uh , valid reason ."
138004,sw3870,sv,"employers ultimately , have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years ."
157130,sw2571,sv,"and , you know , I leave that with the governor , who , of course , is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected ,"
169484,sw3238,sv,"Seems like , um , to me , everything is just changing so much that it 's almost like , um , you ca n't keep up with things any more ,"
49580,sw4644,sv,"and , uh , the benefits are n't as great when I worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay"
173620,sw4113,sv,we are n't tackling a massive ballot every four years .
208776,sw3801,sv,"Well , I was thinking , if you 've been there that long , you 've seen Plano grow --"
146658,sw3269,sv,That 's exactly where both of the wives came from I think .
116292,sw2287,sv,"or you do n't know what they st- , you know , where they stand or anything like that ."
191587,sw4336,sv,"but , uh , I guess most of the things that happen around here are , are pretty , uh , innocuous ."
127778,sw4927,sv,The idea itself of service is good
206113,sw3411,sv,It never really has .
166967,sw3041,sv,"When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it ,"
50373,sw2917,sv,"It 's , it 's going to , it 's going to take quite a while ."
193965,sw3707,sv,"just , just , put them outside , I guess . Unless you ca , catch them in the act ."
73333,sw3750,sv,"so , uh --"
55293,sw4716,sv,"but yet have this ,"
142,sw3743,sv,"I think it will change ,"
147872,sw4902,sv,"On the other hand , you know , the ironic thing about this is that there 's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant ."
121271,sw2309,sv,"but , uh . Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined ,"
184336,sw3073,sv,"There 's not many half hour shows ,"
117688,sw2514,sv,"and you ca n't , the American government you ca n't trust them either , because you think , you do n't know how corrupt they are . I mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and ,"
188119,sw2184,sv,"Uh , being a former drug user ."
205109,sw2708,sv,"as far as this , that good or bad or what ."

192034,sw2789,sv,you ca n't forget how to ride a bike .
191425,sw3445,sv,It 's a kind of one of those psycho ones .

33304,sw3276,sv,it 's getting harder and harder to survive .

54252,sw2780,sv,and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and
13750,sw2368,sv,"-- but , uh , um , the housing is just ,"
119915,sw3926,sv,They need to have a fair jury
64122,sw4363,sv,there 's an element there 's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere .
164330,sw2436,sv,"you know , it was , it was just automatic , too ,"
54147,sw2780,sv,"I I think you know if they if they did n't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag , it would never happen"
169162,sw2316,sv,"but I always , see it 's all , it 's all money ."
211735,sw3113,sv,"and sometimes that 's not real fair either , though"
188917,sw4177,sv,"it is , it is more in depth , less broad ."
153112,sw4130,sv,"and all these God-fearing people were like , well , you know --"
187605,sw3135,sv,"So , it , it was really neat ."
145983,sw2253,sv,They might as well have not even been there .
193716,sw3798,sv,They gave us a hard topic .
151022,sw4051,sv,"but you got to have people that can make , you know , earn a salary to pay for this conversion ."
132969,sw3095,sv,"there 's too much , uh , um , underhanded , uh , things going on that the public are not aware of ."
64220,sw3525,sv,it 's just unreal .
17015,sw4709,sv,"if you do get a job , they do n't pay benefits ."
166490,sw2860,sv,"when they , when it 's not there they miss it ."
78118,sw2609,sv,"And it 's not clear to me that , that 's so much less democratic ."
3993,sw2506,sv,"I think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty , something like that ."
169682,sw3256,sv,"if they release them two hours later , he probably does n't deserve the death penalty ,"
18011,sw2303,sv,"So people do n't really worry about their local mayor or something , figuring that , you know , and I think wrongly , figuring that , that , well , what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now , and you know , and stuff like that ."
117624,sw2514,sv,it 's not my best subject .
7232,sw3676,sv,"I guess it , it really is n't for everybody ."
97280,sw2743,sv,Well I believe that we 've been talking about five minutes .
58191,sw2340,sv,and they 're getting nicer .
168130,sw3328,sv,I guess you have to check yes
113492,sw2969,sv,"Well , I am not so sure that Texans know what , what they have got ."
40910,sw3455,sv,"that was , was really good ."
179888,sw2640,sv,and they 're going to be right back for the same thing
65490,sw2010,sv,"So , it , it has surprised everybody ."
204779,sw2749,sv,"Course , they 'd be , they would be barred ,"
123583,sw3092,sv,"Especially when you have a family , with children , and you are always going to the doctor for ,"
153833,sw2005,sv,"And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest ,"
179015,sw3382,sv,"I guess , uh , you do n't really think about it too much ."
147238,sw2490,sv,basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven
181691,sw2896,sv,"If it 's really old , you do n't know what it 's put on with ."
28875,sw2834,sv,"the , the yuppiedom ,"
81314,sw2836,sv,"Well , uh , the police force , for one ,"
6047,sw3265,sv,"And with the banks being in such financial , you know , problems now that people ,"
197826,sw2145,sv,"It would be a sort of day care ,"
63491,sw3051,sv,Just never .
12495,sw2594,sv,"So I , so I think , you know , we 're probably reaching a successful stage and , and just with voluntary ,"
187243,sw4345,sv,"or , or it 's not happening in your backyard --"
64015,sw4363,sv,"-- when you 're getting paid millions to do it , you ac- , I think they take it to another level ."
105834,sw2616,sv,"And , and there 's no way that you can get them , unless it 's by force ."
114856,sw2887,sv,I know
100357,sw2397,sv,"but it just may not of the original ,"
99225,sw3615,sv,"I mean , their friends are the most important thing there is ."
208097,sw2759,sv,I guess it comes with the turf .
212852,sw2018,sv,It 's such a slow process
135080,sw3105,sv,"And it was , it was really terrible ."
95861,sw3235,sv,"-- and we lived without them ,"
99118,sw2094,sv,"Well it 's just the same thing with the car , uh , uh , the gasoline ,"
70590,sw2460,sv,"I mean , uh , I think that , uh , that a player ought to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch to do it ,"
7870,sw2232,sv,"and that was part of the problem , when they went into the promise land ,"
120433,sw3143,sv,"so you know it must be frus , --"
24813,sw2623,sv,"Let 's face it ,"
6157,sw2684,sv,"and , and , you know , you want to appease the people that have suffered ."
15040,sw2709,sv,You do n't know any of that
676,sw2741,sv,they always either have
59426,sw3692,sv,"And , uh , you know , I think that , that , that the problem with having , you know , junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with , uh , you know , with in , inept politicians --"
157124,sw2571,sv,It is obvious .
181878,sw3633,sv,"And , uh , it seems like it 's just a , an added tack on ."
26001,sw2967,sv,"Uh , which does not make ,"
6650,sw3803,sv,"I , I s- , I lean more towards the control side than , than towards , you know , just the , the free , free army ."
167653,sw2615,sv,"I think those gu- , those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines , if they would have gone with it ,"
160871,sw2262,sv,"Uh , everybody is going to be affected by it ."
196414,sw2095,sv,"just , you know , so mild ,"
22455,sw3788,sv,And unfortunately they are not .
78186,sw2609,sv,"Soviet bloc countries you are , are obliged to vote too ."
195322,sw4378,sv,there 's a problem with those .
45951,sw2662,sv,but I suspect it 's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things .
20114,sw2478,sv,and they 're the ones wasting all the money .
170547,sw2559,sv,"But it 's , it 's hard to define --"
65468,sw2010,sv,I think it was the black hills of South Dakota .
16897,sw3738,sv,"learn how to grow in the , in their college or whatever education they might take ."
157585,sw3021,sv,"Th- , the only way they could do it I think , would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun ."
150394,sw2078,sv,"I mean , I know Yankees have won a lot games ."
169470,sw3238,sv,"seems like they take forever any more ,"
172843,sw2525,sv,"you definitely are going to worry about the location , and , uh , you know , accessibility of people to be able to break in ."
69010,sw3377,sv,"it 's just a , kind of a challenging game ."
192090,sw2789,sv,"Uh , I think , uh , with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that 's fun ."
104876,sw2938,sv,"And , uh , it , it gets bad ."
210177,sw2370,sv,"I think they 're really going to have to , and not , and not just for mothers , for fathers as well ."
58286,sw2340,sv,"I think that 's neat ,"
153621,sw3541,sv,"Well , that 's probably the next year 's agenda ."
52283,sw2803,sv,"and I 'm thinking that community service would help them , uh , just get a feel of what else is out there , how other people are living , you know ,"
124867,sw2793,sv,"at least one not more than say three or four , then it would definitely effect unemployment ."
105292,sw3012,sv,and I think maybe it 's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along .
151879,sw2012,sv,and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there 's not even a person there .
185056,sw4312,sv,"I can , I can believe that ."
124460,sw3029,sv,You know he 's done what he 's done .
61876,sw3746,sv,we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine .
124804,sw2793,sv,"it 's not top wages ,"
105481,sw3355,sv,"so that , it , it 's really neat ,"
14671,sw2342,sv,"What I thought was interesting is that , uh , apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet ."
13328,sw3500,sv,-- most of them do .
128676,sw2622,sv,"Uh , sales is lucrative"
20058,sw3054,sv,"Apparently , an earth quake caused it ."
121803,sw2452,sv,"Someone is going to assassinate him , you know ."
121867,sw2452,sv,because Iran still is n't too friendly with them .
194668,sw3154,sv,"and I 'd say , you know , they were doing things then that we should be doing now"
121685,sw2452,sv,"The other thing that I think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the , the reports that I hear back"
103442,sw4149,sv,They ca n't afford to have a really good job .
78856,sw4633,sv,-- and I do n't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some .
155817,sw2349,sv,I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them .
18092,sw2303,sv,"Total indifference , you know ,"
62610,sw2499,sv,TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book .
79990,sw2015,sv,"I think it 's great , that you know , freedom of speech in this country and everything ,"
23027,sw2621,sv,obviously not very fast .
129431,sw2926,sv,"you know , kids ca n't read , um ,"
29511,sw3764,sv,"And , uh , evaluation of an individual . Course , all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have ."
139430,sw2630,sv,"The point being , and your sons will learn this from you , I 'm sure , that , uh , no matter what age you are , you can learn --"
97839,sw2648,sv,"if we , if we keep putting that stuff into the air and , and , you know , if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it 's really going to be a problem for , um , just the , the Earth , you know , what the Earth is receiving back , you know ,"
5322,sw2981,sv,"something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me ,"
187205,sw3876,sv,I guess you run into the pollution factor .
168718,sw2650,sv,"and they 're friends ,"
106463,sw3675,sv,Texas has quite the history .
81846,sw2441,sv,get something out of that money .
25972,sw2967,sv,I think .
50418,sw3151,sv,or --
206033,sw3108,sv,so --
79575,sw2130,sv,"everyone was discussing whether we should , uh , wait longer ,"
2440,sw4774,sv,"I 'd hate to have to ,"
96158,sw3387,sv,"They make a decision based on consti- , constituency --"
21761,sw2437,sv,"and who , all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another ."
62616,sw2499,sv,nobody could figure it out .
31877,sw2205,sv,"You may never get the truth ,"
64425,sw4691,sv,"Well , it 's a good past time , you know ."
108443,sw3225,sv,"They would be , if you just had time to do it ."
147292,sw2490,sv,"You know , so that they 're not very distinguishable from a real gun ."
16698,sw2379,sv,and then we are getting back into us .
45955,sw2662,sv,"I guess because we do n't know ,"
128568,sw2622,sv,"I mean , it 'd be , it 'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older ."
24231,sw2471,sv,"and the , probably the bigge , biggest problem down there is that 's where the , that 's the drug entry points ,"
165589,sw2717,sv,"But I mean there 's , there 's , there 's a lot of other crimes out there , I mean besides murder ,"
674,sw2741,sv,"And especially men who teach school , they do n't make that much money ,"
182240,sw2554,sv,It 's not us .
35985,sw2689,sv,because these kids are saying why should I go to high school
48822,sw2149,sv,"Oh , well ,"
133629,sw2235,sv,"but then , they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy ."
141514,sw2448,sv,"Uh , it , it 's , it 's a little hard to believe ,"
159858,sw2504,sv,"And , okay , this , this candidate tells --"
214429,sw2611,sv,Well that 's good that they 're so casual .
158465,sw2608,sv,and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is .
10906,sw3985,sv,and I 'm sure a lot of them do n't .
77077,sw2734,sv,they should n't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway .
152690,sw3393,sv,That 's a long time . Uh .
130694,sw2751,sv,"And , and , uh , of course , Ford is n't too bad ."
91718,sw2285,sv,"-- I mean that 's what you , you 're going to have to expect that to happen ."
56802,sw3076,sv,"It was a dirty , mud slinging campaign ."
189585,sw4830,sv,"I mean , you know ,"
48061,sw2744,sv,"The , uh , the cure , some of the cures that I 've heard for this that , that sort of make sense ,"
120135,sw3090,sv,"You should have one in the , in the ,"
170412,sw4347,sv,"Yeah , it --"
154266,sw3776,sv,"Uh , I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster ."
169066,sw2316,sv,"I think the schools today , you know , the public schools are just , they 're just overrun , you know ,"
167812,sw2111,sv,"well we have those , uh , which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans ."
107646,sw2992,sv,I know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there .
13718,sw2368,sv,"you know , you say , sun room to them , and you enclose and you can sell it ."
209101,sw2548,sv,it should n't go out that much .
83313,sw2703,sv,but you do n't read many sports books
33352,sw3198,sv,"and I think that 's even going to get better . Even , you know ,"
17934,sw3282,sv,"And , uh , so I , you know , I do n't know so much if these peace talks are going to ,"
193500,sw4356,sv,"And that 's kind of , that 's , that 's probably one thing I 'd look at ."
3962,sw2506,sv,"but I tell you I 'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work ,"
172941,sw2525,sv,"and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt , these people are guilty ."
160252,sw2427,sv,"Well , the good stuff ."
40146,sw3280,sv,that 's nice sometimes when they --
186122,sw2945,sv,"I mean it 's not just for him ,"
10082,sw2716,sv,"I think , I think people are starting to really mean it ,"
122704,sw4752,sv,"And it 's just , that 's just ridiculous"
142885,sw3515,sv,"Uh , another thing I thought of , I guess , to recycle would be like clothes , because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other ."
210057,sw2370,sv,"You 're supposed to only want the job ,"
109448,sw2313,sv,"it , it 's hard to believe that you 'd run up twenty , thirty thousand dollars of , uh ,"
157335,sw2407,sv,"this would be , this would be frightening ."
118773,sw2900,sv,"I mean , so many people do n't even get prenatal care"
210090,sw2370,sv,maybe if you get along
42747,sw2839,sv,The spending is out of control .
44768,sw4655,sv,"Because it seems like the small town nursing homes , there 's a --"
45398,sw3642,sv,and so that the other people have no health insurance
168825,sw2650,sv,"so that would make you really ,"
112013,sw2104,sv,"the people there have money ,"
97864,sw2648,sv,believe me it 's just so much better .
52263,sw2803,sv,"because they , they understand people more ,"
176936,sw2998,sv,"But with the pollution issue , uh , fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway ."
198256,sw3083,sv,"and uh , you do n't have any , any kind of a good environment to live in , you know ,"
11602,sw3760,sv,"But , I think that still borders on hobby ."
160908,sw2262,sv,"And that 's , all cars are doing that ."
5393,sw2981,sv,"I know that they are lowering the age of , uh , whatever is considered a minor ."
102550,sw3279,sv,"but I do n't know . It 's just hard to , hard to take and , you know , see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use ."
119814,sw2283,sv,-- but I do n't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering .
185690,sw4151,sv,"I , I just ,"
43391,sw2767,sv,"It 's , um , one of those things that , you know , seems to happen ."
173041,sw2525,sv,"but I think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes ,"
115207,sw2887,sv,and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits .
81038,sw2229,sv,"I 've always of that to be , uh , really one of the best forms of exercise ,"
15697,sw2953,sv,"Oh , that would have been such a great memory ."
146487,sw2965,sv,you 're just better off buying another car .
79593,sw2130,sv,"Well , had , had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor ."
62959,sw2455,sv,I think it 's hard to find a balance there .
160764,sw2262,sv,"and what comes up , must come down ."
174477,sw2910,sv,"-- and if you did n't like it , that was just too bad , you know ."
190571,sw4148,sv,"Well , the , the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I 've talked to on this , is that in the situation you just said where it 's nine to three , or some such number , that there 's , an effect starts being that there 's starts being a lot of peer pressure --"
64004,sw4363,sv,"That 's kind of , that 's kind of strange ."
175955,sw3246,sv,I think maybe we 've given our teachers a almost impossible job .
41220,sw2234,sv,"Then , they do n't really think they should pay for them , maybe ."
22702,sw2353,sv,"today 's young people are short-term pleasure oriented ,"
22199,sw2960,sv,That is a real cute show .
170684,sw3344,sv,"so ,"
168817,sw2650,sv,they 're so small --
83023,sw2703,sv,"It 's like , okay ,"
52152,sw3267,sv,-- and that is a pretty big newspaper
139890,sw2376,sv,"because you hate to contribute to the problem ,"
165728,sw2634,sv,they 're not going to take those courses .
83833,sw4376,sv,"In other words , you 'd have to , you 'd have to murder more than one other person --"
114396,sw2431,sv,but I think you need the shoulder thing --
130980,sw4605,sv,"and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up , you know ."
137560,sw2585,sv,"You 're going to get a situation that I think a lot like what happened to the blacks , being sort of led out of slavery"
45364,sw3642,sv,"And possibly , y- , just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing ,"
171319,sw2439,sv,"So then it becomes , uh , more realistic ."
81135,sw2229,sv,But it 's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is .
87777,sw3565,sv,"once you get it done , then you probably wo n't have that problem again ."
55886,sw2983,sv,"requires special shoes ,"
103587,sw3666,sv,"They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas ,"
9543,sw3597,sv,"I do n't know what 's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that , because I think that 's bad for us ."
104882,sw2938,sv,"-- and , uh , it really does make a difference , although it , it settles , you know ,"
3656,sw2638,sv,"you know , if you 're not working with someone on drugs , well then you 're going to have less accidents ,"
172933,sw2525,sv,"it 's a little more understandable under the circumstances , I guess ."
64044,sw4363,sv,"After awhile , I , I prefer forty , a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just , just to --"
34365,sw3463,sv,"Used to be people would say , do you work , and you 'd say , no , I work in the home"
199857,sw2399,sv,"but , I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it , that , like that ,"
112680,sw2380,sv,"and , I think sometimes that a criminal should kind of ,"
93697,sw3023,sv,and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets .
183335,sw4133,sv,"-- it 's mainl- , lot of blacks ."
133724,sw2235,sv,That 's a lot of power for one or two people to have .
28490,sw2924,sv,you can hear .
110632,sw2849,sv,"either way , you know , was great ."
189694,sw4340,sv,"That 's the most prevalent crime . Uh , the ones that really , you know , the ones that really add up after a while , I guess , you know , from , s- , far as insurance money and stuff like that , insurance costs ."
154071,sw2154,sv,"It ca n't hurt , ."
44060,sw2955,sv,I mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things --
148532,sw4154,sv,"But , you know , I think , I think that , that , um , we chose to have our official feelings hurt ."
207254,sw3796,sv,that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him .
133420,sw2387,sv,"Well , I guess that covers it ."
141463,sw2448,sv,"And , yet , they 're , uh , the gun control enthusiasts are , are , uh , preaching about the gun control and how they should be , we should have stronger laws and what not ."
58462,sw2467,sv,"and , uh , of course , nothing ever goes down ,"
66711,sw2521,sv,"But , maybe we , maybe we 'll get your guy ."
79719,sw2324,sv,"it 's not as sound intellectually , but , like you said I mean , come on ."
142728,sw3646,sv,"so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time ,"
33951,sw2386,sv,"well , if you , if you can make yourself do the tread mill , I mean , gosh , that 's a good workout ."
128830,sw4759,sv,"It is ,"
144416,sw4032,sv,But only thing I 'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees --
20189,sw2478,sv,"and apparently there was , you know ,"
133335,sw2387,sv,"Well , that 's a good thing to do ."
213306,sw3142,sv,"uh , a waitress or waiter that waits the table , it 's nice that they 're attentive"
62903,sw2499,sv,"Waterfront property here at Love Canal , you know ."
149124,sw3309,sv,I think we get short changed on that .
17292,sw2191,sv,"And that 's probably something that , that you could do , you know --"
187704,sw3135,sv,I just can not fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center .
78646,sw2053,sv,You would have
6054,sw2684,sv,I think you got it .
192269,sw3227,sv,"Some of it 's okay , uh --"
31990,sw2205,sv,"It is interesting though ,"
170479,sw2559,sv,"I 'm not sure that that 's an everyday thing , though , at least not for , you know , an individual ."
41944,sw3454,sv,but they 're more apt to be in political offices --
186711,sw4321,sv,and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict .
205090,sw2708,sv,"In other words , they 're in there for a purpose ,"
69230,sw2617,sv,"And I , I believe that we have to have a military"
119075,sw3898,sv,It 's nice to find a place like that .
190811,sw3658,sv,"It 's very complex , very complicated ,"
93321,sw2828,sv,"And then everybody else is stuck with that , regardless of what they want to teach ."
102675,sw2102,sv,"Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard ,"
14959,sw2709,sv,"But what I see is y- ,"
178316,sw3259,sv,They do those real corny commercials .
185251,sw4628,sv,"In a lot of cases I think you 're treated more like a number instead of a , a person ."
195794,sw3144,sv,"And course , growing up on , on the back of a horse , you know , and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was so true"
15750,sw2953,sv,"But it does seem , you know ,"
187230,sw4345,sv,"It gives you a whole different perspective on the news , uh , when you hear it from , say , a European --"
185165,sw3506,sv,"I would n't be the big , uh , snotty kind ."
60190,sw2773,sv,"and , uh , then , we can , and we do n't tend to read Israel correctly"
22946,sw2621,sv,"They always think they can win , you know , which is the way it should be ."
9522,sw3597,sv,"and we should see to our own lives , but not to a total disregard of others ."
98983,sw2137,sv,"Well I ,"
129584,sw2926,sv,"but the consequence ,"
195505,sw4109,sv,You just do n't have any time to do anything .
23407,sw2959,sv,"You stand there with a rifle and blow a , a piece of somebody apart ,"
153527,sw2669,sv,"so . I , I think as long as people have a choice , they 're going to stick with the American way ."
23383,sw2959,sv,"and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him ,"
63315,sw2545,sv,And she could have bought a typewriter also .
204835,sw3171,sv,"Oh , that will be fun , too ."
76744,sw2365,sv,"A lot of work ,"
18007,sw2303,sv,"I think on the local elections it 's actually , um ,"
28383,sw4822,sv,we ca n't live there .
5704,sw2944,sv,but it 's here .
141968,sw3002,sv,And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news .
58396,sw2340,sv,"I mean , people are all different ."
147501,sw2490,sv,"And , that 's one of them"
30810,sw2794,sv,"The true source of the problem is , a , that we do spend too much ,"
194863,sw4129,sv,"and some of them are our problems ,"
191299,sw3075,sv,"Oh , they , they , they really are ."
25025,sw3162,sv,I 'm not going to listen to the facts or --
72495,sw2295,sv,that 's the problem --
48801,sw2149,sv,"and you know , if you can do any a little bit , it helps ,"
64084,sw4363,sv,"It 's just , it 's never going to reach that , that standard"
42274,sw3751,sv,"In ,"
103830,sw3408,sv,"it 's frustrating , I guess ."
80353,sw2461,sv,"it 's amazing , uh ,"
129801,sw2736,sv,"I know they 're trying to do everything they can to , uh , end the recession ."
136136,sw3291,sv,I mean there 's nothing wrong with that .
120802,sw4726,sv,"And I mean the , the technology 's not that hard ."
2458,sw4774,sv,and I just --
5051,sw4799,sv,"They , they wanted to do things ."
55773,sw2983,sv,"You hit a little ball ,"
205306,sw3476,sv,"or , you have highway signs saying speed limit , uh , eighty , eighty-five , whatever would be the appropriate number ."
51548,sw2610,sv,"And the other one 's two point one kis ,"
151897,sw2012,sv,"and I ca n't talk about the second one other than to , to , to generate paranoia ."
16379,sw3059,sv,"but then there 's these , um , periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there 's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again , it , uh , will increase the revenues from the movie ."
177649,sw4826,sv,"it 's not a problem , uh , because I hate to feel like they are a problem , although they are ."
182204,sw2554,sv,And we make experts by reading books .
140840,sw2178,sv,But he 's kind of branching out .
21190,sw2675,sv,"And , uh , I , I feel like if they do n't , people do n't like what our flag stands for , they 're welcome to go some place else ."
193670,sw3798,sv,But it 's something you got to think about these days .
74010,sw2502,sv,"I think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic , uh , country ,"
21705,sw2437,sv,"So that , that 's the only thing , I think , that might be a little bit of a problem ."
189533,sw2395,sv,the comics are better in this newspaper .
97423,sw3403,sv,"Well , the Rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect --"
70304,sw2792,sv,"But I think you get out of the habit , like you say ,"
120455,sw3143,sv,"they have all sorts of , of rights , that , you know , are questionable ."
153687,sw3541,sv,"example , they keep raising the taxes on booze ,"
135929,sw4856,sv,"I mean there , there 's no connection between the two ."
73993,sw2502,sv,"they tend to be more ,"
145152,sw2641,sv,"Well , dogs are real high maintenances ,"
168457,sw2826,sv,"and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to ,"
191521,sw3445,sv,That 's a real warm movie .
37040,sw3270,sv,"but , um , I know that state has , uh , cutback , uh , raises for a year to help , uh , the , uh , state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better --"
17949,sw3282,sv,"I think , I think that they 're s- , they 're so much more vulnerable now because they do n't receive support --"
114347,sw2431,sv,"and they 're really nice , uh ,"
53284,sw3046,sv,it never gets real cold .
186195,sw4082,sv,Well you wo n't offend me .
153131,sw4130,sv,I really do n't .
185584,sw4362,sv,"Uh , but I 'm not quite sure that it 's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools ."
14875,sw2709,sv,And you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals .
47858,sw3118,sv,Maybe there should be more than twelve people .
38893,sw2968,sv,"I do not really know if , uh , any one person knows , uh ,"
88563,sw2039,sv,"but there 's too much historical fact involved just from the uh , the histories that are , were developed around that time , that are available ."
19590,sw2355,sv,"and I do n't think a lot of people , you know , realize a lot , the plight of a lot of people ."
6811,sw3253,sv,"but maybe not the , yo- , you know the Canada men 's trip , but some other , you know ,"
86670,sw2657,sv,that 's just not realistic .
137970,sw3870,sv,"We realize that for the individual person , some things are very important ."
55237,sw4716,sv,"and nobody would see it ,"
24099,sw3244,sv,That 's kind of the way Dallas is .
165352,sw3296,sv,"See that 's why I , it 's interesting because you have I , I 'm going to say you have an accent ."
193216,sw3156,sv,"it seemed like , uh ,"
36831,sw3061,sv,So you just never know how that works out .
166962,sw3041,sv,but you might not be so --
159923,sw2504,sv,Now that 's bad .
204660,sw2749,sv,"Huh . Well , you would think that they would get that in the , uh ,"
13546,sw2483,sv,"and then I think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would , would have better state coverage rather than local coverage ."
185705,sw4151,sv,"I would think you 'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than , you know , telling them that there 's , there 's protestors out here at the , you know ."
45192,sw2578,sv,"And you have so many out there that , uh , that you , you know , you never get a chance to read ."
21981,sw3255,sv,"-- and , uh , but if they are polluting the air , they need , do need to have them fixed --"
194953,sw4646,sv,But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something .
42590,sw2839,sv,"There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for ,"
185887,sw2945,sv,"and , --"
195452,sw2546,sv,"it , it 's terrible , you know"
204473,sw3174,sv,"but , uh , I feel that it 's probably pre- , it 's pretty good if , if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs ."
105795,sw2616,sv,"You know , and , uh , that 's something that , that has been , you know , very ,"
84601,sw3223,sv,"but everybody perceived him that way , and stuff --"
52499,sw2803,sv,"And that , that 's why I think if people were more exposed to , uh ,"
155387,sw2488,sv,"I mean there 's no doubt ,"
15034,sw2709,sv,"Probably if I did , I might be a little bit more , uh , tolerant ,"
23392,sw2959,sv,We did not actually physically lose them .
81932,sw2441,sv,"and now we 're no- , we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game ."
36271,sw2389,sv,"Like they wo n't have that ,"
46952,sw2552,sv,"If you 're , stay at home and you 're a mother , it 's like what a waste ."
72141,sw3576,sv,They just do n't have the same ones in the supermarket .
116172,sw2424,sv,"Well , I , I think another thing too that , um , I 've had a little contacted with , uh ,"
26341,sw3013,sv,"but , but it 's really good ."
94284,sw2602,sv,Yeltsin 's in tight with the old guard .
67188,sw4618,sv,Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something .
19332,sw3774,sv,"And , uh , there 's not so much of it completely innocent --"
167047,sw3041,sv,"and then everything went away for a couple years ,"
163651,sw4858,sv,"And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the , uh , early decisions of the Vietnam war . That the , uh , people saw the cold war as , uh , you had to draw a line and , and defend it ."
91555,sw2285,sv,"Um , then again , I do n't know really what steps there are that they ,"
8947,sw2354,sv,they 've proven that .
46959,sw2552,sv,"and , and that should be first and , and children second ."
149148,sw3309,sv,"So , we 're comparable ."
56605,sw2227,sv,-- and that 's it .
2692,sw2038,sv,"Well , there are those that , that , that think that , that , that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance , particularly for the military ."
13668,sw2368,sv,"they 're not doing anything about ,"
39257,sw2693,sv,you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products .
189810,sw4340,sv,but usually they are n't .
42972,sw3810,sv,"Well , it can get expensive --"
73769,sw2092,sv,"because you know , you have to ,"
121729,sw2452,sv,"I , I am a little concerned about you know ,"
47797,sw3118,sv,I do n't think it would convict any more people .
164635,sw3334,sv,"but I have a feeling that we , that we really do n't understand basically the , the , the competing factions in lot of those countries"
174902,sw3320,sv,but they do .
160950,sw2262,sv,It 's scary .
119482,sw2797,sv,"you know , they 're not all the same"
78051,sw2609,sv,Apparently they do n't think it 's a problem .
207017,sw3201,sv,"I mean it , it sounds good to the public"
188765,sw4171,sv,but it 's big enough .
183810,sw4334,sv,"the type of music , at least to me , it 's , uh , sounds like it 's only sounds good at a high volumes"
112629,sw2380,sv,"Now , the one thing I did approve of there was that we did n't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case ."
164206,sw2436,sv,"It must be the marketing pressures ,"
155300,sw2488,sv,Very much so .
167070,sw3041,sv,"and that , you know , that was so wonderful that they done that"
87191,sw3200,sv,And I think though that we need to have some liquid around that you do n't have to go through the company to get .
81421,sw2836,sv,Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes .
85982,sw2421,sv,would be some measure of protection .
165173,sw3720,sv,"Well , I think it 's a big , it 's a big , um , responsibility ."
92788,sw4072,sv,"Uh , you know , it , it just seemed to lack any sort of debate ."
172224,sw2139,sv,"using your Social Security number , of course , permits people to do that --"
72998,sw3606,sv,"you see it on the news all the time ,"
205358,sw3561,sv,"So that , that , that 's the current predicament ."
211349,sw2060,sv,"you do n't even , even know about it ."
184034,sw4319,sv,"Uh , anyway , the , our benefits are pretty good ."
118282,sw3056,sv,and it makes you think about things .
26123,sw2967,sv,"and that , you know , that is what makes it so interesting ."
1393,sw2296,sv,"I think we 've probably know , know each other 's exercise habits --"
35011,sw2957,sv,"and I 'm sure you 've , you 've labelled the cause , because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave ."
132591,sw3587,sv,I bet it 's pretty over there .
119580,sw2797,sv,"And it was just a complete culture shock ,"
58390,sw2340,sv,"So , he , I mean , I do n't think he , he could get hurt ."
183860,sw4334,sv,"late , late sixties , early seventies , they were --"
199163,sw2539,sv,"And that I think has contributed much to , uh , the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we 're having . Uh , that the students ' , uh , parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning"
140707,sw4840,sv,we 're still not able to pay off things just because --
153057,sw4784,sv,One is education for civic duty .
96179,sw3387,sv,"When you are talking again , uh , billions and trillions of dollars --"
110895,sw3805,sv,right that 's --
177495,sw2062,sv,"but ,"
69347,sw2617,sv,"And , and I think that 's where we as American people really failed , you know , failed them ."
50457,sw3151,sv,I think that 's where a lot of the problem is at first .
55604,sw3518,sv,"I think that education with a gun is , is critical and important ."
175886,sw3215,sv,I guess you have to take some things and leave some things .
14876,sw2709,sv,"And it 's k- , it 's kind of scares me , not that I do n't want them here and not that I do n't appreciate the fact that , you know , that they have rights too ."
110917,sw3805,sv,"It 's lopsided , very much"
52034,sw3709,sv,"that is , that is a pretty good clip"
39238,sw2693,sv,"And you 're just more aware of food for energy ,"
78956,sw3450,sv,And it 's safe .
23227,sw2959,sv,"I think that , uh , Desert Storm ,"
29654,sw2854,sv,"It was constantly , no , I do n't want him ,"
22399,sw2960,sv,"and some of them are like , uh , videos --"
9726,sw3979,sv,"but I think that the opportunity is definitely there for , um , people to invade your privacy when they want to ,"
58196,sw2340,sv,and boy that really pumps them up .
118958,sw2537,sv,I do n't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much .
22087,sw2960,sv,"the problems that their kids get into , are , are good to , uh , show that they do have problems anyway ."
163413,sw2909,sv,and it is n't .
121282,sw2309,sv,"Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing , you know , it 's true that , you know , this may be sad and all that thing ,"
176940,sw2998,sv,"So , uh , but it is something that 's a little frightening"
109508,sw2313,sv,"The laws are a little squirrelly ,"
62622,sw2499,sv,You ca n't put it in pictures .
210145,sw2370,sv,and --
144731,sw3584,sv,"Well , you know , these guys that gambled high --"
163738,sw2653,sv,"but if they were careful , they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works ."
202359,sw3242,sv,You just do n't think of that happening with teachers --
104154,sw3049,sv,"And , I thought that was really good ."
144192,sw2249,sv,"If they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience , I think most people would ."
87024,sw3150,sv,you 'd have to be scared to death .
76463,sw3124,sv,"so , uh , I , I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets"
182157,sw2554,sv,"And that 's a big mistake ,"
148332,sw3300,sv,"So , I guess we 're supposed to start talking ."
114186,sw2431,sv,"you probably would n't have ,"
17808,sw3908,sv,"Also , much of it is driven by economics right now ."
156879,sw2678,sv,"lot of the classics are really ,"
154721,sw3345,sv,I think we 're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have --
75784,sw2072,sv,"and it 's healthy , too ."
41481,sw3204,sv,"and , but I think you 'd have to really ,"
187485,sw3315,sv,They 're stupid .
54127,sw2780,sv,That 's and that 's the
158029,sw2241,sv,"It seems that , uh , bermuda 's , bermuda 's fine"
164487,sw2266,sv,"but , uh , some of the crap that 's on T V nowadays ,"
118692,sw2766,sv,I think they know what they believe
103301,sw2197,sv,"it 's , there 's a lot of factors that people do n't ever , ever consider --"
177492,sw2062,sv,"Uh , I can see some , some potential changes that probably are , are , would not cost very much but might , uh , make things a little easier ."
194549,sw4619,sv,"It 's , it 's a nice , uh , relatively nice environment"
40654,sw3847,sv,"-- and those are always pretty ,"
193055,sw3580,sv,I think that 'd be neat .
68405,sw3333,sv,I really do .
184558,sw4346,sv,"good curriculum , uh ,"
150436,sw2078,sv,"sometimes when I , if you go out there during the day , you just fry under the sun ."
83058,sw2703,sv,I think that 's unbelievable .
170687,sw3344,sv,"He 's , uh , usually on the ninety-eight to two side ,"
141986,sw3002,sv,and they 'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something .
169556,sw3238,sv,"men do n't treat you like you do n't know anything , generally --"
147849,sw4902,sv,And I think probably it 's pretty important right there .
82074,sw2441,sv,"and pride in themselves , too ."
55295,sw4716,sv,they have to have a certain respect for it .
90788,sw2252,sv,"Uh , but , of course , the people who have challenged that or tried to do , on- , have cor- , have not been world powers ."
174892,sw3320,sv,"I , I think it 's the murder capital of the country now ."
18012,sw2303,sv,"So people think that , that , that they do n't have , um , that , that it does n't matter as much , whereas I think it 's probably just the opposite is true ."
127551,sw2726,sv,"and the , seems like the market here 's picking up ."
94948,sw2435,sv,but it was better than it could have been .
169605,sw3256,sv,"-- well , you know , forget that ."
102137,sw2549,sv,"And , uh , uh , unfortunately , of course , the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years ."
200989,sw4342,sv,"I have to admit , the TIMES is kind of provincial , too ."
68267,sw2032,sv,"so they just , do n't name it ."
95862,sw3235,sv,"we did fine ,"
22193,sw2960,sv,That is cute .
178297,sw3259,sv,The place of the seventies .
73909,sw2502,sv,"they , they were feeding us , you know ,"
65179,sw2533,sv,That 's so stupid that you all have two teams .
118596,sw2766,sv,"And I , you know , I think if we did know I think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because I do n't , I do n't think people could handle it ."
175226,sw2970,sv,"It is , it is really scary ."
177614,sw4826,sv,"Well , well , for one thing there 's not enough money in the school system ."
52378,sw2803,sv,"just because people or so , I do n't know , just today people are just so money hungry ,"
48653,sw2149,sv,"That there 's no problem with getting them to ,"
122587,sw3384,sv,"I think the , the other thing that , that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children ."
149447,sw3343,sv,About quality .
52284,sw2803,sv,"if they were to work in , in a , a , I do n't know , a soup kitchen or something ,"
177547,sw2062,sv,"It seems like , it depends on what , what group you happen to be in , what , what you 're going to get and what you 're not going to get"
54041,sw2780,sv,"I think , um , this is a tough subject because , uh , when you come from two different parts of the country , uh , the political views are really different ."
30927,sw2794,sv,"we would be ,"
17637,sw3158,sv,"But , it 's such a lost art ."
63533,sw3051,sv,"When you watch them go up , you are just amazed that they do not fall over ."
31382,sw3203,sv,Your pricing .
28470,sw2924,sv,"because ,"
211565,sw3925,sv,That 's a good point .
128966,sw3429,sv,Now it 's we 're protecting our lives .
63312,sw2545,sv,"but like I say ,"
6205,sw2684,sv,"Some sort of program or ,"
127572,sw2726,sv,and people are pretty stable here .
67947,sw3628,sv,"It 's , uh , lot different kind of ."
29536,sw2854,sv,"Uh , but a lot of the other ones that have , are professional , uh ,"
147809,sw4902,sv,"I , I think , uh , I think when we come to a time of recession that it 's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time ."
203789,sw2604,sv,"It might not be the same neighborhood , but the same city or county , because then you 're , you 're coming in contact with it ."
205275,sw3476,sv,"Uh , the , the , the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems , uh , money , dollar , coins , anything like that ."
169492,sw3238,sv,"but I guess more than anything I think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do , you know --"
58213,sw2340,sv,and get that youth back .
35910,sw2689,sv,That 's one thing I guess I could think of .
91137,sw2818,sv,"It 's amazing that people actually ,"
113501,sw2969,sv,So it was really too late to do much .
199042,sw2539,sv,"but nowadays if there are two parents to a family , the mother works just as hard as the father does ,"
211698,sw3113,sv,"or even a panel of , of lawyers if , if it got to that point . Might be better at than just regular civil people ."
50957,sw3014,sv,"but , you know , Escort is supposed to have a great track record --"
55885,sw2983,sv,"the equipment is very expensive ,"
130770,sw3340,sv,"I , I think I , if it 's , if you 're in a field ,"
115730,sw3030,sv,"Um , but it 's fun ."
4605,sw2168,sv,there 's too much emphasis on test .
59564,sw3723,sv,"you see a lot of , uh , mostly older people though but , that , uh , walk in the malls ."
3670,sw2638,sv,"and it goes around ,"
33910,sw2386,sv,they 're pretty .
38514,sw3496,sv,"it was quiet and restful , and , and so beautiful ."
23153,sw2621,sv,"and ,"
82218,sw2724,sv,So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation .
152620,sw3524,sv,"-- but , we are seasoned minds ."
152913,sw4483,sv,Otherwise you got bees and ants
174122,sw3040,sv,"Whereas in , in , uh , in Dallas here we 've , we 've got , uh , those patterns were well established before , before we really tried to , tried to do the DART ."
21604,sw2929,sv,"But a maj , a lot of them do n't do these things even ,"
123188,sw3402,sv,"there 's a mild attempt for that ,"
158983,sw3663,sv,the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally --
157248,sw2571,sv,"Because , there 's no , the answer is not being given to them , in the court system"
96667,sw2299,sv,"Well , I think we need to do more ."
97267,sw2743,sv,that 's what I think too .
159028,sw2526,sv,"there 's , there 's no question"
83824,sw4376,sv,"So if you have someone that , that destroys that value --"
54045,sw2780,sv,"but like gun control and , uh , day care an things like that ,"
149629,sw4812,sv,"Uh , I think it 's important to insure the quality and , and , uh , I do n't know , almost the goodness of character . You know --"
18137,sw2303,sv,and I suspect she could get a large voter turnout .
30920,sw2794,sv,"And then at that point ,"
109975,sw3283,sv,it does n't .
165467,sw2717,sv,"and so , uh , you know , their , their success rate is very high ."
141325,sw2025,sv,"Well , the sentences are so unbelievable ."
116431,sw2287,sv,"You know , that 's not the best way"
120712,sw4675,sv,but I figure that will help me save --
21513,sw2929,sv,"Well , if he 's pleased with it , I guess that 's , uh , the bottom line ."
81528,sw2434,sv,And you can get them really cheap .
213785,sw3134,sv,they do n't know what 's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex .
25154,sw2889,sv,"But , it 's g- , it 's nice to have it when you 're done ,"
154757,sw3345,sv,"But by trial and error over the years , I think they got it about as good as they 're going to get it ."
137034,sw3050,sv,and you want to see it hit the green .
57159,sw2237,sv,"That 's , a lot of people do n't have that much space even ."
4361,sw3433,sv,"I think , you know , there 's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons"
191096,sw4049,sv,"but I , uh , I am totally against that sort of a , uh ,"
57406,sw3855,sv,"because if anything ever happens that you do need to , you know , you have excellent credit ,"
36562,sw2457,sv,"and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy ,"
153760,sw2005,sv,"And , you know , facing that situation , it 's , it 's quite a dilemma ."
15044,sw2709,sv,"and for some reason Orientals are very , uh ,"
104646,sw3373,sv,"It 's been pretty good . Some ,"
117705,sw2514,sv,"and , uh , so I just think that , I think that God is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership ,"
45389,sw3642,sv,I do n't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea .
177316,sw3168,sv,It 's too free .
28400,sw4822,sv,"It would have been another planet to kind of take over and , uh , continue on ."
175172,sw2970,sv,"or where they are at , you know ."
133033,sw3095,sv,"Well , they , again the ,"
105892,sw2616,sv,"so if I di- , leave it at a dollar ten , people are still going to pay ."
33553,sw3077,sv,"Well , you are , you are the same age as my daughter , because she just graduated from college this year too ."
28553,sw2924,sv,"it 's too bad one of us do n't have some knowledge on this ,"
205256,sw3476,sv,"Uh , I suppose things , some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening , having a new generation come up that 's more used to it ."
28613,sw2924,sv,"when someone is , is on trial for something , you ca n't bring up prior convictions ."
63623,sw3523,sv,It definitely --
194735,sw3154,sv,"Well , it will be interesting to see how , over the next year , this all works out because , like on the , uh , grass , I 'm , I know your husband , uh , does n't really like the paper sacks ."
27162,sw2821,sv,"where you felt like ,"
48348,sw3735,sv,you got to have a pattern for the body --
123194,sw3402,sv,"It 's more negative , like you said ."
204751,sw2749,sv,and sometimes those twelve people could care less .
67362,sw2260,sv,"I do n't think they really cared about the answer ,"
108004,sw2065,sv,"because from what I understand , from some of the guys I know , you know , crime , uh , is punishable , just almost , uh , instantly and --"
60975,sw2423,sv,"we 're getting to where ,"
214352,sw3887,sv,we can comment
112841,sw2883,sv,"and , uh , and an awful lot of people are in trouble ."
106817,sw2450,sv,Seems very high .
8888,sw2354,sv,"and , uh , it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that , that give you the strength ,"
63207,sw2545,sv,you can do wonderful design .
182547,sw4649,sv,And another thing is cost .
112027,sw2104,sv,"They do n't understand that to make that work ,"
121399,sw2309,sv,"Actually make them do something that 's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the , you know , world and not spend so much time sitting around , letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them ,"
18038,sw2303,sv,"I , I , I would guess that that portion of the population is massively under represented ."
18569,sw3379,sv,"Um , I think the people are , are just fed up ,"
47984,sw2744,sv,"And , uh , you know , those , those that , you know , come out , you know , fall out of the system , that are , are real trouble ,"
44079,sw2955,sv,"uh , my main opinion would be w- , w- , we should not have done it ."
111668,sw3097,sv,"They do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible ,"
9505,sw3597,sv,"Well , I think that society has come to a point where they 're not responsible for any of their actions ."
128137,sw2122,sv,"and you have to have so many people sharing the same data ,"
91463,sw4159,sv,"So again , it never really penalizes ,"
205627,sw4908,sv,"Of course , uh , you being from New Mexico , you 've probably been n- , to Washington . Especially if you 're , your present location ."
3612,sw2638,sv,"But a lot of people , I think , after they thought about it for awhile , and you know , weighed the pros and cons , decided , you know , it 's really not a bad idea unless you 're doing drugs , of course ."
192156,sw2789,sv,"I , I , I guess at that point it would turn into a task , ,"
49696,sw4644,sv,"Because , uh , salary wise I do n't think I 'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large ,"
117653,sw2514,sv,"I wish we would have just ,"
150961,sw3313,sv,and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention .
51229,sw2576,sv,and then I think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things .
111503,sw3097,sv,it changes
98083,sw2362,sv,"Money ,"
194962,sw4646,sv,Then you only go there as a last resort .
122653,sw4752,sv,sentenced to jail for like thirty years they 're out in five
194864,sw4129,sv,"but a lot of it 's because everything society wants , we are supposed to do ."
151830,sw2589,sv,"They are never going to let a , a teacher spank a child again ."
71886,sw2858,sv,and what 's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids .
159611,sw2466,sv,"There 's another one he wrote that even sounds better ,"
29739,sw2854,sv,"But , but still , you know , it was much better than being shipped to --"
119882,sw2283,sv,"Oh , a tree MUMBLEx is always something very nice to have ."
12557,sw2594,sv,"Well , in some ways , I guess , it , it does n't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it , you know . Because ,"
25434,sw2495,sv,"It 's like , it 's , uh ,"
70946,sw4184,sv,"and , you know , they just , they just love kittens ."
71015,sw4184,sv,they 're actually very friendly dogs .
18097,sw2303,sv,"Now if things go the way that , that , that they are there , I think that they 'll keep voting ,"
172958,sw2525,sv,"I , I do n't consider Mexican people in the same category with , uh ,"
28856,sw2834,sv,"But they do n't have a national organization of men ,"
109387,sw2313,sv,Sounds like we have no conflict .
89840,sw3081,sv,-- that 's good --
102163,sw2549,sv,"And , uh , so I think it was kind ever interesting ."
64910,sw2782,sv,I think you have to budget those things though .
192729,sw2109,sv,"It , it might have one best picture , too ."
203721,sw2604,sv,"I mean , everybody 's got to do it ."
114929,sw2887,sv,I mean that 's nothing .
200568,sw4079,sv,"Those things can really upset your budget when they , when they come in ."
207424,sw4880,sv,"and , and , and th- , there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at , rea , reasonable and proper ."
194392,sw2451,sv,"and they put their pants on the same way ,"
14597,sw2888,sv,"It 's just , I mean , everywhere you turn ."
114469,sw3330,sv,"and so people should be advised to look for those ,"
98154,sw2362,sv,"It 's an interesting , interesting thing you want to do ."
106094,sw2806,sv,"an , and we 're kind of their pets ."
190963,sw4382,sv,"And , uh , it 's , uh , it 's getting worse ."
191603,sw4336,sv,you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it --
115202,sw2887,sv,and that does n't definitely make it any better .
60127,sw2418,sv,"Well , it 's tough right now for everybody ."
87724,sw2020,sv,"some of it ,"
70608,sw2460,sv,"And , and all he has to do is hit the ball ,"
1066,sw2040,sv,"I , I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- , feeling of second class citizenry , uh , to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote ."
167818,sw2111,sv,"but ,"
145677,sw4565,sv,"it 's like sticking , uh , an electrode into their pleasure center"
112713,sw2380,sv,that would be wrongful .
148126,sw4077,sv,"They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know ,"
47981,sw2744,sv,"Well , ye- , that would be , be at the absolute most ."
107583,sw3596,sv,"it was , it was real cold ."
15715,sw2953,sv,"To me it did n't , does n't seem like we have got much ,"
117650,sw2514,sv,"I think their policy with them that though , is , uh ,"
119299,sw3845,sv,Not from Texas .
177331,sw2062,sv,"besides , they tend to offer ad , adequate vacation , I guess ."
50545,sw3151,sv,there 's a lot of people that think that there 's nothing wrong with MUMBLEx .
166501,sw2860,sv,"but occasionally they do ,"
128032,sw3556,sv,he is --
66777,sw4659,sv,of course a part of it is technology .
22244,sw2960,sv,"Well , I think that is a good show too ."
49472,sw3028,sv,"Well , I guess if you were having , if you were trying to impress somebody w- , like taking somebody that you had n't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant ."
114055,sw4080,sv,"You know , you always be able to get around"
195015,sw4181,sv,I do n't think anybody pays too little .
20426,sw2812,sv,"And I think since then is , is when a lot of the women 's roles have started to change ."
115803,sw3030,sv,"and , and you know people really pretty much appreciate it ."
130375,sw2265,sv,I think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items .
81477,sw2836,sv,"And I think one of the big things that you can do is , to increase deterrence is , uh , if someone is found guilty of a , uh , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship ."
21254,sw2675,sv,It does n't make sense .
109530,sw2313,sv,"-- I think that the whole credit card issue , I think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts"
143680,sw2157,sv,That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year .
83814,sw4376,sv,"Like for petty , for theft and , and stuff like that or manslaughter , you know ,"
194729,sw3154,sv,"and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons , the wood , uh , racks which now , basically , you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold , uh , twenty-four bottles ."
116288,sw2287,sv,you 're not sure where to go and vote and all that .
28435,sw4822,sv,"and the people , their moods are extreme , you know ."
72999,sw3606,sv,"but until you 've really seen it , it does , it does n't really hit you ."
50661,sw4681,sv,"I mean , that kind of thing"
70724,sw2460,sv,"But I mean , you do n't have to spend the big money , as far as I 'm concerned to , uh , to win ."
105741,sw2616,sv,"See , I , I do n't agree with it ."
46218,sw3104,sv,"because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are , they can make a , you know , a much better income ."
169079,sw2316,sv,"but if do n't work with them as a parent , I think you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage ."
203726,sw2604,sv,"Uh , I mean , that , that does n't sound right ."
154274,sw3776,sv,"and , uh , I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate the , the pace of learning ."
174622,sw2558,sv,"but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from , um , some sort of public service ,"
41489,sw3204,sv,"And so many people when they put people in the nurses home , they never see them ."
33403,sw3198,sv,"and some of the men are developing , uh , very good too ."
162553,sw3662,sv,"Because , because a lot of them are , you know , they 're hypocritical ."
157059,sw3052,sv,"I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care , you know ."
97709,sw2648,sv,"but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean- , or stream or such ,"
42765,sw2839,sv,That 's what they 're called --
14827,sw2342,sv,"and MUMBLEx , but I sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around have jihad against themselves ."
45010,sw2323,sv,"You know , it 's like they , it seems like they can , their , their army or whatever can , can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do , do the job with , uh , you know , less suffering ."
103742,sw3408,sv,That sounds .
167285,sw2469,sv,"It 's , it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be ."
182930,sw3205,sv,They probably just take it for granted then .
130397,sw2265,sv,That 's tough .
70117,sw2486,sv,"I think that you , you make of that what you wish"
6078,sw2684,sv,"that , that I find very difficult to swallow ,"
15154,sw2707,sv,"for someone who does n't garden , I 'd say , that , that 's my biggest recommendation is to ,"
3213,sw2614,sv,"I guess they pass the names amongst your computer students , or whatever ."
23443,sw2959,sv,"And that ,"
60728,sw2433,sv,"it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you 'd be tired ,"
187242,sw4345,sv,"I think a lot of it is just , uh , the fact that in the U S you 're so far removed , uh , in a lot of cases from , say , conflicts"
21556,sw2929,sv,"That 's a nice state ,"
35392,sw3257,sv,"but they do come on kind of late ,"
116138,sw2424,sv,we need enough help here in this country .
11289,sw3055,sv,"you have the house to clean and , you know , the whole business that goes with it ."
112814,sw2883,sv,"But , uh , I , you really do need to be very , um , oh , responsible about it"
122365,sw3384,sv,"and I , I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home"
170664,sw3344,sv,this --
166881,sw2866,sv,It 's a nice area .
24472,sw3231,sv,"it was , it was more of a love story --"
188745,sw4060,sv,"I was going to say more , it 's more personal for one thing ."
75733,sw2072,sv,"so the time goes by , you know , before you realize anything is going on ."
48657,sw2149,sv,"And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays , I mean at least they 're getting out and doing it and you know , helping , helping out ."
188966,sw4177,sv,"I 'm , I 'm pretty sure it is , because , uh --"
117113,sw2105,sv,"and , uh , that , I mean they really are ."
103115,sw2197,sv,but you eventually forget most of it .
891,sw3426,sv,They say it 's really horrifyingly scary --
78310,sw3551,sv,"And , uh , one thing , they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing ,"
147085,sw3103,sv,"Uh , it just seems that , it seems , it seems that they are more comfortable that way ."
170176,sw3655,sv,then all the things you hear about them .
193776,sw3798,sv,it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would .
22942,sw2621,sv,"They really d- , they have to have ,"
81122,sw2229,sv,Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging .
208639,sw4033,sv,"And I think even in the elections , they choose who they 're going to follow and who they 're not ,"
109015,sw2893,sv,so you 're still young .
74977,sw2160,sv,because it sure is monstrous in this country .
199417,sw2628,sv,"I mean , i- , it really is coming to that because most women now days can not afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them ."
30738,sw2982,sv,"those have its pluses and minuses , too ."
36338,sw2389,sv,"We really have ,"
49187,sw2228,sv,"and I think that 's kind of why they , they were making the riskier loans ,"
195718,sw4320,sv,"Uh , and prohibition did n't stop it and did n't do anything really --"
17925,sw3282,sv,"I think , I think they realized we would probably never push him out"
74470,sw2800,sv,"So , they 've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then ,"
17798,sw3908,sv,So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units .
194307,sw2451,sv,"And I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on , peace on both sides ."
147129,sw3103,sv,"So , uh , uh , that would be a beautiful relationship ."
33399,sw3198,sv,"It may be in the future that men , you know , some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves ."
149827,sw2587,sv,"Well , they 're struggling with it ."
78973,sw3450,sv,"The , uh , swimming , they say , uses more muscles than any other exercise with ,"
79090,sw2835,sv,"That 's certainly ,"
5673,sw2944,sv,"I mean there 's , again there 's no consistency ."
138386,sw2713,sv,they 're great for an office
188404,sw4339,sv,and I think that 's probably a little over kill for this day and age .
56818,sw3076,sv,"Well ,"
117736,sw2514,sv,"I do n't think they have any more money than any of the other countries ,"
42598,sw2839,sv,At least you have n't thrown out all the work they 've done for months and months and months and months .
185738,sw4330,sv,But I think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field .
31079,sw2754,sv,And then they get out .
36200,sw2389,sv,"even if you want to say home , you really ca n't ."
10392,sw2768,sv,"and I think it 's because they 've gone since they were real little ,"
7070,sw3019,sv,"And , I really ,"
60224,sw2773,sv,"I mean ,"
13716,sw2368,sv,"-- but , but they love it ."
159843,sw2504,sv,"and , uh , certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that , you know , they , they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant"
109748,sw2300,sv,"And so , it 's just kind of strange , you know ,"
26771,sw2064,sv,certainly not .
150461,sw2078,sv,but they try every year
50839,sw4735,sv,"Uh , I think they should have more programs like that ."
69142,sw2617,sv,"Um , looking back , like maybe some of the things that I know now , I , I 'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives ."
116304,sw2287,sv,"so they think , well , you know , why vote ."
205640,sw4908,sv,"I mean there , there 's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could , you could use for landfill . MUMBLEx ."
58190,sw2340,sv,"I think that , uh , hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it ,"
4797,sw2711,sv,Without a doubt .
63914,sw2177,sv,-- that looks really good too .
61632,sw2619,sv,"and , I think that 's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute , an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters ,"
165785,sw2634,sv,"in this sort of wild west scenario , you 're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature ."
185271,sw4628,sv,"So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that ."
90359,sw4071,sv,They have nice plans

58882,sw3121,sv,"you know , you do n't want to ,"
188443,sw4339,sv,"but , uh it 's real nice for carrying around our kids and others"
118890,sw2537,sv,"It 's , uh , you know , it , it 's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically"
42722,sw2839,sv,And we 're all going to have to do it .
192155,sw2789,sv,"I just need to , put the old nose to the grindstone ,"
96816,sw2299,sv,it 's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere .
115704,sw3030,sv,that 's true .
54044,sw2780,sv,"I guess like , like they 're nothing , I guess , nothing is as awful as abortion"
159730,sw2504,sv,and I think it does .
201434,sw4736,sv,it 's more they 're not enforcing the death penalty itself .
33160,sw3057,sv,"and that is sad , because , I think the health profession is one of the most critical ,"
153606,sw2669,sv,"At that time , anyway , that was still when things were ,"
165157,sw3720,sv,"And it 's , it 's very hard , because when you get used to two salaries , it 's very hard to , to cut back to one ."
42760,sw2839,sv,"If they do n't do , if they do n't , if they do n't pull it in and start doing something , I think they 're really going to have to I think ."
3333,sw2614,sv,"they , they were lucky enough to have some oil , what , ten years ago , an ,"
195942,sw3144,sv,"That 's not an easy part to play , I , I do n't think ."
50387,sw3151,sv,"it 's , it 's --"
38089,sw2426,sv,"Well , I do n't think there 's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they ,"
127851,sw4927,sv,". Well , that 's kind of scary ."
171452,sw2439,sv,You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in .
9902,sw2716,sv,"I mean they are the ones ,"
141396,sw2025,sv,"so , he , he would have a heck , or she would have a heck of a lot of power , you know , if used wrongly ."
208299,sw2290,sv,and then there are people who catch .
121915,sw2452,sv,and they both have holy sanctions .
104405,sw4723,sv,"there , there 's something about having a place to live ,"
68825,sw2645,sv,"actually , what the positions that they found outside of the company were much , much better than the ones that they currently had inside ."
203649,sw2837,sv,"And you know , they 're ,"
50752,sw4681,sv,"and , uh , you know , you 're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns --"
152250,sw2171,sv,"You have to ,"
191389,sw3075,sv,"Huh . Well , may , maybe now things are calming down again ."
187823,sw4353,sv,"Uh , it 's , it 's kind of , uh , you know , it 's kind of hard to explain ."
30699,sw2982,sv,"But you know , I would n't be surprised if thing 's like that did n't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones ."
122016,sw2181,sv,"but when it was , the real slapstick moments , him versus the criminals kind of thing , it just sort of lost the human element --"
117729,sw2514,sv,It is having a good moral background .
8466,sw2528,sv,I think it 's something completely new .
117505,sw3773,sv,"That empty nest syndrome is going to set in , I guess ."
41994,sw3454,sv,"and , and we wo n't see them back for another two or three years ."
131385,sw3063,sv,"and as we educate them individually what they can do , people become more aware of the things in industry too that , that are causing problems"
109743,sw2300,sv,"But we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years ,"
201403,sw3883,sv,"but I did n't think teachers should , you know ."
121377,sw2309,sv,"that serves a kind of if they 're , I guess , uh ,"
83829,sw4376,sv,"So if you terminate him , that 's a loss of value ."
74018,sw2502,sv,I think they 've made a lot more chances .
127569,sw2726,sv,"and then the , the houses are all , most of the houses are pretty nice ,"
116866,sw3096,sv,"And the only , uh , branch in the armed fo- , services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force ."
177211,sw3168,sv,"It 's , uh , it 's a scary thing to know that , uh , you just do n't know what people are doing --"
117879,sw3353,sv,"Well , that sounds like fun ."
163890,sw2653,sv,I guess we 've kind of covered it .
70118,sw2486,sv,"and you can go the opposite direction and , uh , over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you , which do n't belong in the , in , at least in my opinion , in the work place ,"
126451,sw3828,sv,your state 's a good example
34640,sw2293,sv,"it 's , it 's ,"
183839,sw4334,sv,"that 's more , even more commercialized for of --"
187000,sw4325,sv,I think it would be kind of stressful .
88052,sw3115,sv,"Well , I bet you 're , you 're , you may dress differently , then , for that ."
208064,sw2759,sv,"You know , secretaries are n't , are n't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something ."
71799,sw2858,sv,"But , uh , you know , then the kids kind of suffer ."
50194,sw2917,sv,"I think that 's a really good way to handle it , because that way , if you , if you paid off every month , you never have to worry about , well , how much do I have to pay these guys , you know , this month , you know ."
118989,sw2537,sv,"I guess the one that really got me too was that , uh ,"
199772,sw4123,sv,"if , if you do n't watch it there , then you 're going to hear somebody else 's canned , uh , report , somebody else 's view about it"
124358,sw3029,sv,"Innocent people could do that ,"
174108,sw3040,sv,"I think it 's like , uh , back east ."
211666,sw3925,sv,I think you can legislate
169800,sw2868,sv,"so some of the things are not as , quite as , uh , adaptable ."
174037,sw3040,sv,"But , uh , I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases ."
73520,sw3586,sv,"Well , they 're probably hardy , harder to take care of"
42676,sw2839,sv,"But there are , they need to put more limits on them ."
62790,sw2499,sv,it was so good .
147566,sw3784,sv,so we can do whatever the hell we want to do .
186016,sw2945,sv,"because I think yu- , you know , you grow closer ."
165727,sw2634,sv,"basically , the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway"
42685,sw2839,sv,"I , I , you know , I think that 's probably , un- , unless we can afford it ,"
205284,sw3476,sv,MUMBLEx just get one .
110791,sw3190,sv,"Uh , but , you know , other , other than that , with , with both my kids being under two , it 's real hard --"
142693,sw3646,sv,We would n't have thought of crossing a teacher when we --
108997,sw2893,sv,It 's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger 's sister just does n't get it .
194348,sw2451,sv,"I mean , that 's --"
115093,sw2887,sv,a lot better .
164024,sw2691,sv,"Uh , not as good as it would have been --"
199501,sw2628,sv,then you go to work
188717,sw4060,sv,"and it 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know ."
175610,sw2331,sv,"It , it , it really works that way ."
150290,sw2956,sv,"I mean ,"
49974,sw2862,sv,I mean they 're sleeping in different bed every night
126962,sw2952,sv,"But ,"
47041,sw2552,sv,but --
25992,sw2967,sv,At least --
120706,sw4675,sv,It 's so rare
26005,sw2967,sv,"It was just all legitimate kind of , uh , film ."
28012,sw2557,sv,"And I know people would be willing to do more , like saving their newspapers and that , if they had a place to take them ."
199498,sw2628,sv,"But I think it 's getting more and more like ,"
208646,sw4033,sv,I think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on .
199390,sw4137,sv,Once you get up --
63631,sw3523,sv,"Have more of an active role in taking care of children , more of an active role in taking care of the home ."
22106,sw2960,sv,He always got to change history is what it is .
24221,sw2471,sv,"about , uh , like you say , using them , yo- ,"
10905,sw3985,sv,"and , uh , that 's the type of goal I think most people ought to look for ,"
104299,sw4056,sv,"sometimes dental costs can be , um , just about as expensive , if not more ,"
171110,sw2790,sv,"it 's going back towards , you know ,"
61501,sw2279,sv,"and let 's see how we can get rid of the problem , you know ,"
69046,sw3377,sv,It 's a good game though .
182056,sw2554,sv,"But , uh , I really think it 's , it 's a U N issue ,"
204547,sw3174,sv,"But , you know , I think they can test all they want for drugs you know ,"
19450,sw2355,sv,or good that it ended as soon as it did .
183852,sw4334,sv,"It 's becoming not necessarily good music , just popular music , you know ."
186752,sw4321,sv,"Well , I mean , I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served ."
23403,sw2959,sv,"everybody that has , that has stood there ,"
139206,sw2630,sv,"That 's the thing to do ,"
145650,sw4565,sv,"That ki- , the kids maybe on the average get , uh , something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents ."
130268,sw3036,sv,"I mean , I think life is just music ,"
116471,sw2287,sv,and I do n't think they ever care to .
195947,sw3144,sv,"That 's at , that one wo n't your sides ."
42809,sw2839,sv,"And they , they really had done some good , some good work ."
168290,sw3068,sv,That 's that 's usually the basic criteria .
16875,sw3738,sv,I think it 's great .
73995,sw2502,sv,They 're not really sure of what they are . I do n't think .
19648,sw2355,sv,"because it really is exciting ,"
66870,sw3294,sv,"the , the market seems to just be growing , too ."
47898,sw3118,sv,"but then again , maybe they should be there"
6259,sw2684,sv,And a few people in the news that bring it to us --
106793,sw2450,sv,"but anyway , but I guess you 're right though it has been real hot ,"
26862,sw2821,sv,"It was n't that bad ,"
187034,sw4325,sv,That 's interesting .
206133,sw3411,sv,Just a nice comfortable ride .
14866,sw2709,sv,"but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent , uh , very wise in money matters and have ta- , have taken over a lot of businesses ,"
51863,sw3363,sv,they get pretty expensive .
164699,sw3334,sv,The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule --
103119,sw2197,sv,I mean people who do n't go to college become adults in other ways .
147058,sw3103,sv,"And they do not have any , uh , ego , uh , problems that they are fighting ."
214412,sw2611,sv,"you really do n't want to dress up unless you , you , uh , have a job"
170642,sw3344,sv,"but , uh , we 've got a budget deficit that just wo n't go away unless it gets seriously addressed ."
11100,sw4721,sv,I think it 's well worth it .
58845,sw3121,sv,"Mainly because , I , a lot of it has to do , I think with more women working --"
55425,sw2844,sv,"And it 's scary ,"
166246,sw2784,sv,"but I guess overall , because I guess I 'm not associated with what ghetto schools , and , and , uh , and , uh , rural school systems are like , I , I should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure ."
105245,sw3012,sv,"well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there ,"
132475,sw2663,sv,"And if it , if it had passed ,"
42674,sw2839,sv,"the other thing is , it 's , it 's all very well to give money to help people , other people ,"
66420,sw2521,sv,"and then they , uh , they were n't getting the draft picks"
115154,sw2887,sv,It 's not .
58199,sw2340,sv,That is very nice to see young people .
78811,sw4633,sv,"You know , one parent go one direction"
23015,sw2621,sv,"He 's such a , he 's about a half hot head anyway , such a temper ."
131350,sw3063,sv,"at least they 're starting , you know ."
213232,sw3142,sv,I do n't think so .
210801,sw3138,sv,"Well , I think we 've probably talked long enough"
191241,sw3075,sv,And that 's quite fun .
106435,sw3675,sv,But it 's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who 'll sign it and let you do it --
89499,sw3728,sv,"it 's , uh , it 's easy to keep up on current event- , you know --"
155713,sw2349,sv,"I 'm not sure they need to be , you know , paid , you know ,"
19826,sw3001,sv,Does n't quite feel as good .
57218,sw2237,sv,"but , you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that 's MUMBLEx been laying around ,"
111877,sw2476,sv,"Well , people they , in general , are just getting married a lot later ."
107785,sw2992,sv,"And that 's about the only way that I can , that I can do it ."
182269,sw2554,sv,I mean we 've got loads of foreign students --
98474,sw3088,sv,"Well , I , I feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately , that I think there are some occupations that they should , such as the health field , the transportation field , uh ,"
146074,sw2253,sv,"Which is about the developmental level that , you know , you need to be at to read those things ,"
64747,sw3443,sv,"E- , even in some families some people talk a little bit different ."
13717,sw2368,sv,"I mean , they , they , they think they 're getting ,"
47286,sw2830,sv,she 's not as good as she use to be
18074,sw2303,sv,-- I suspect their opinions would change very quickly .
30965,sw2794,sv,"Uh , a huge amount of what you hear on , about the seventy-five dollar hammers ,"
91138,sw2818,sv,"the stamina that you must , you know , draw from yourself to deal with it ."
29255,sw2292,sv,"Um , especially when they finish all the construction out here --"
202081,sw2477,sv,but I do n't think he 's really been a super star for them .
78339,sw3551,sv,-- or is how you end up .
15761,sw2953,sv,"And I think that is only right though , really ."
119562,sw2797,sv,"it is , um ,"
45498,sw3946,sv,I think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care --
721,sw2741,sv,"I think that the , we still have a long way to go ."
116175,sw2424,sv,but you will at least double that amount
164291,sw2436,sv,"But , that takes too much planning ."
131334,sw3063,sv,"and they 're , and they 're destroying us ,"
77141,sw2734,sv,"I , I believe it 's any capital crime related to drugs ."
82464,sw2131,sv,"you ca n't dance to it ,"
55651,sw3518,sv,I think that I should have a right to own a handgun .
106165,sw2806,sv,"It was a beautiful animal ,"
68909,sw3187,sv,but I think that at some times it can be the right thing to do .
86650,sw2657,sv,"but I 'm sure ,"
208041,sw2759,sv,and he 'll cover up for you
155840,sw2349,sv,It really is .
52252,sw3428,sv,if somebody does n't do something .
8961,sw2354,sv,"You know I bet that 's why we have some friends that eat only ,"
185782,sw4330,sv,I think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident .
81896,sw2441,sv,"I mean , there 's got to be a different way ."
101339,sw2073,sv,"and ,"
46666,sw3064,sv,"you 're going to pay twenty , twenty-five in interest charges ."
21947,sw3255,sv,the only problem that we have and that 's all over the whole world is ozone --
71747,sw2858,sv,"It 's , it 's really hard , hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that are different ."
111057,sw3453,sv,You know . Lincoln is still as big as it always has been
134331,sw3039,sv,"And , uh , there 's less , uh , friction involved in relationships when you add that skill --"
149560,sw2067,sv,The idea is to use their money .
96250,sw4138,sv,"but they 're running under the assump- ,"
157609,sw3021,sv,"but ,"
83761,sw4698,sv,It 's a little bit strange for me .
190393,sw4318,sv,"but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our , uh , car manufacturers have for a while ."
201552,sw3140,sv,"and they do n't have the , um , a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world ."
193841,sw4038,sv,so --
88226,sw3115,sv,But if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted
167940,sw2111,sv,They 're the exact same thing .
183034,sw4358,sv,"and , uh , they 're not , uh , too inclined to do something as aggressive as that ."
13473,sw2483,sv,"So , I think we find out what 's happening in the city , uh , on a fairly frequent basis , over a , over a gin and tonic sort of thing ."
67284,sw2260,sv,"but , you know , it seems like we pay the state ,"
28508,sw2924,sv,"because they , they know that you 're biased ."

139282,sw2630,sd,"and ,"
84626,sw2113,sd,"this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the , the living , more or less ,"
202011,sw2477,sd,"And , uh , I was very pleased with all three games , because Kansas , uh ,"

140990,sw2178,sd,"and , uh , well , the first week , I think , a lot more people were doing it ."
72749,sw4834,sd,not really .
88177,sw3115,sd,"They , they dress pretty good , I would say"
198752,sw2061,sd,It ca n't last seven years
81077,sw2229,sd,"But , uh , that gets old too in a very short order ,"
152431,sw2171,sd,and I have n't gotten a one of them yet when I 've called .
145593,sw3699,sd,He was a little surprised .
17457,sw3042,sd,"I hope that ,"
201063,sw4890,sd,I mean there are forty people --
48890,sw2149,sd,"I wish I could do something like that ,"
172995,sw2525,sd,"They said they can just about guarantee that there , that , that would happen if you did that ."
139196,sw2630,sd,so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is --
180865,sw2667,sd,But she loves it .
206696,sw3682,sd,"I liked your idea too , there ."
182709,sw3420,sd,We 're pretty excited .
190422,sw4318,sd,"I would buy something ,"
211709,sw3113,sd,"when I only do something one , two or three times I 'm hardly an expert on it ,"
115476,sw2085,sd,They could go visit them during the day .
126453,sw3828,sd,"As far as the murderers , and people that commit rape and things like that , I 'm not sure what 's right ,"
69484,sw3229,sd,"I just love ,"
71843,sw2858,sd,"it was , I guess I did n't realize what a luxury it was at the time ."
16031,sw3657,sd,"And these are the big mamas , i . e . sons , uh , Hewlett Packards , uh --"
147098,sw3103,sd,"those are the only , only issues we ever fight about ."
14784,sw2342,sd,"There are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night , which ,"
125576,sw2631,sd,because that 's where T I is .
156934,sw3052,sd,"And , and , uh , my father bought this , uh , my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care"
123888,sw3065,sd,That 's when I was in the elementary school years
131666,sw3535,sd,"Uh , on Rutherford ."
95178,sw2435,sd,"the supporting actor , he was good ,"
76530,sw2365,sd,-- and it was smooth
53125,sw2934,sd,and the wind and everything was incredible .
13419,sw2483,sd,"we , we wake up to television news and , uh , uh , shower and dress , and whatever to that ,"
5818,sw3228,sd,what I try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good --
110863,sw3805,sd,"Hey , listen , if I had my way , I would n't pay my taxes ."
41665,sw2942,sd,"so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something , that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this , or , um , one literature , you know , or a , a literature course or , just all sorts of different perspectives on it ,"
13346,sw2483,sd,"Uh , in general most of them , uh , people doing this are T I -ers ,"
23880,sw3769,sd,It had a fireplace .
190123,sw4166,sd,I 've heard the name
3598,sw2638,sd,"And , uh , it resulted in , in a few people leaving ,"
29216,sw2292,sd,"we 're at Aetna with an , uh , ex- ,"
157369,sw2407,sd,"and they 've quoted statistics that I just about , my throat just about fell into my toes ."
94912,sw2435,sd,"You know , it 's , uh , it looks good , you know --"
155204,sw3362,sd,"I do n't do a whole lot of it , um , at this exact point in my life , um , because I have two teenage boys ,"
193123,sw3580,sd,"but I do n't know whether , it , it , research will go on ."
114276,sw2431,sd,"and I went to see my mother ,"
203568,sw2837,sd,"-- and , you know , they have to be doing something constantly ."
34463,sw3647,sd,"You 're in Plano also , huh ?"
184458,sw4028,sd,so I --
41280,sw3383,sd,and it 's something I can do still .
140791,sw2178,sd,And I really liked both of them .
182637,sw3420,sd,"So , um , that 's something that I 'm probably going to be looking at --"
46512,sw3747,sd,The Christ United Methodist Church in Plano .
5108,sw3233,sd,"So , I , I , I like to read the , the children 's books ,"
89992,sw2756,sd,We 've done it a couple of times
200232,sw2729,sd,and he said I ca n't believe that you 're still getting such a kick out of that movie .
3091,sw2125,sd,but I enjoyed it .
68002,sw2032,sd,I went to their concert last year when they were here .
65361,sw2533,sd,but last year he made MUMBLEx
207220,sw3796,sd,and then they came back in the second half
36168,sw3686,sd,definitely .
50337,sw2917,sd,I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never --
157241,sw2571,sd,"uh , we were across from that big bus station ,"
200330,sw4019,sd,"and , while he showers , it 's so hilarious ."
48991,sw2446,sd,"there was , uh , several other companies ,"
16390,sw3059,sd,that 's pretty much what I do .
166555,sw2860,sd,"So , uh , they never played together or anything ."
11070,sw4721,sd,"not with the sense that it was , uh , uh , chore or something that I was having to do ,"
87258,sw3130,sd,"So that 's , that 's been their summer money"
193486,sw4356,sd,"I , I 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that ."
106984,sw3072,sd,"-- and it was , it 's really , it 's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are"
64705,sw3443,sd,"Well , my husband works at T I over on Central ."
61647,sw2619,sd,"you just say , well look read the miles per hour one ,"
15384,sw2707,sd,"Uh , MUMBLEx . It is very interesting , uh , subject ,"
34429,sw3463,sd,but my daughter and her husband were out of town
60329,sw2773,sd,"And , um , but it 's , it 's a very beautiful part , very interesting historically , of course , which was my interest MUMBLEx art history ."
382,sw2278,sd,"-- but there 's like two fellows from , uh , Brooklyn ,"
213113,sw2772,sd,I 'll have to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that .
50990,sw3014,sd,Nissan .
1268,sw4666,sd,"And that 's , Lord , that 's , uh , over five months worth ."
139275,sw2630,sd,and then Bucknell in mid-state Pennsylvania .
199617,sw2628,sd,"All my income goes for things like luxuries ,"
141530,sw2448,sd,"and frankly , I , I do n't understand why a state does n't have those records available anyway ."
106472,sw3675,sd,"-- and then , you know , we put I guess it 's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account ."
157876,sw2241,sd,"Well , uh , pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard ."
176823,sw2998,sd,"You know , uh , i- , I guess it talked about all types of pollution ."
84356,sw2382,sd,and they did n't have any coverage under my name
210325,sw3304,sd,"Oh , I generically have , you know , millions of hobbies ."
30360,sw3852,sd,"-- uh , no problem at all ."
108988,sw2893,sd,"I did n't build up muscle , though ,"
182620,sw3420,sd,"I have three children , um , two , two who are in regular school , uh , eleven year old , an eight year old ,"
18649,sw3379,sd,"But I , I , I , I have to say , yes , I 'm , you know , I 'm encouraged by the way it 's going . Uh ,"
108807,sw2515,sd,My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work .
136879,sw3050,sd,"I , we have three teenage daughters ."
133999,sw2999,sd,"and I do n't know what we pay for his card ,"
89109,sw2599,sd,"and , uh , I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals"
94504,sw2485,sd,"Some of the other people , the older people organized it ."
114813,sw4147,sd,I would estimate seventy pounds .
105320,sw3012,sd,"I got to say ,"
208677,sw4033,sd,"But a lot of the times , I , you know , I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper ,"
196962,sw3389,sd,"They just score just enough points ,"
37176,sw2562,sd,I do n't like to have to have to pull grass --
208381,sw2290,sd,Of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops --
129492,sw2926,sd,but we struggled
204606,sw3174,sd,"-- and I , you know , I do n't know why they both made him do that --"
154032,sw2154,sd,"Indeed , I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening ."
57882,sw3448,sd,"that 's , that 's where the speech program is . Uh ,"
56983,sw2237,sd,"Uh , I , I really enjoy it ,"
54749,sw2175,sd,"So all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports ,"
6237,sw2684,sd,"And I , I 'm a broadcast journalist ,"
202887,sw2429,sd,And you 're not supposed to eat those because they 're bad for you .
90448,sw2366,sd,"we , we 're very similarly aged ,"
31948,sw2205,sd,I do n't recall that they have any female anchors
143921,sw2492,sd,"It 's like , I 'm not standing in a mound , though ."
94043,sw2877,sd,"So , he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to ."
114278,sw2431,sd,"and it got better than , I think twenty-two , twenty-three miles a gallon ."
161966,sw3533,sd,I play in several symphony orchestras
28781,sw2924,sd,they did .
74196,sw2719,sd,"Well I , I used to lift weights an awful lot , and stuff like that ."
114248,sw2431,sd,"Well , as soon as I get my quarters in , I 'm ,"
73410,sw3586,sd,"I , I do some sewing , mostly out of necessity ."
70057,sw2486,sd,"for me I just , I just , cou , would n't want to do that ."
100654,sw2832,sd,"yo- , you 're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything ,"
191168,sw3075,sd,"but , uh , my favorite is the , the indulgent ones , where we go off and , and , uh , see places that have interested me since I was a kid ,"
69576,sw3569,sd,it is .
137923,sw3681,sd,but if everyone did we 'd probably have over a hundred
15229,sw2707,sd,"and they seem to come back year after year ,"
38704,sw2968,sd,"Uh , well , I read everything , uh , I guess , uh ,"
15593,sw3166,sd,"and then let it sit on the bottom ,"
89723,sw3081,sd,"and what you do to make it , you take the shell and you spread the beans on first ,"
104121,sw3049,sd,"I guess , I can wait another month"
180265,sw2627,sd,my husband did too .
42110,sw3716,sd,"Just like , uh , really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed"
194911,sw4129,sd,"Well , you know , somebody elected that recently ."
146499,sw3825,sd,"then he reminded me , but"
66732,sw4659,sd,We fax --
75736,sw2072,sd,but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while .
274,sw3530,sd,I have enough of that in my own life .
145426,sw2641,sd,"but I mean fall ,"
183089,sw4358,sd,"matter of fact , that , that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa- ,"
138264,sw2248,sd,"But every Friday night they 'll go home , you know , straight from work"
54304,sw2780,sd,"I do n't know anybody that actually supports abortion ,"
191995,sw2789,sd,But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant .
21783,sw2437,sd,and then they start a drug problem .
47570,sw2774,sd,and he helped me
80708,sw3756,sd,"I think we are going to do , uh , another bathroom ,"
34070,sw2190,sd,"And it 's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars ,"
39508,sw2693,sd,We 've got a good Chinese restaurant in town .
169044,sw2316,sd,"and some of the , the better parts of the Metroplex , the , the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools ."
7838,sw2232,sd,"You just could n't believe that they would , that they would be mean , and , and , and , and drop bombs and kill people ,"
105093,sw2938,sd,"My husband was in the service ,"
53367,sw3046,sd,"You know , that 's one meal ,"
108604,sw3359,sd,"You talk about spicy ,"
29979,sw2524,sd,"you know keeping busy with everything else going on ,"
140761,sw2178,sd,but I 've heard that it 's real good .
72082,sw3576,sd,and we do miss that .
206323,sw3152,sd,and I never would want to work for him .
136512,sw3000,sd,"You know , it 's , it 's sort of like Hollywood in a way because there 's , there 's favorite haunts for Southerners and things like that ."
121616,sw2027,sd,"because , there 's one that always wears a suit ."
118780,sw2900,sd,"I have a solution , you see ."
8981,sw2354,sd,"and so they have a ,"
179756,sw4801,sd,the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what --
97550,sw3503,sd,this guy is up for the death penalty .
145568,sw3699,sd,"it 's quite different than it was before ,"
91384,sw4159,sd,"If they are losing money , then they 're going to raise rates ."
86376,sw2479,sd,it 's Bright Steps in Lewisville .
97769,sw2648,sd,"but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it 's not , it 's not"
32547,sw2884,sd,"So I say if she wants to go out and buy something , I never argue with her , because she 's real good at , you know , sort of MUMBLEx ."
209933,sw3251,sd,"and about this time of year there is , it starts getting a little old ,"
191314,sw3075,sd,I like shopping .
210094,sw2370,sd,might have been better .
74246,sw2719,sd,"we are just south of that little bridge , back-up on the hill in the trees there ,"
145045,sw2372,sd,If it was a customer presentation then that would be different .
166983,sw3041,sd,Before we found the shopping malls that 's what we did .
170165,sw3655,sd,just a baby-sitter in a home .
97388,sw3403,sd,"you know when he quits at being active , he will go into , you know --"
179323,sw2568,sd,but I just have never been a Stallone fan .
166765,sw2866,sd,"I do n't ,"
71746,sw2858,sd,"I can , I can , I know what you mean ."
180244,sw2627,sd,"and that kind of interrupted the game ,"
107002,sw3072,sd,"I keep wanting to get up to ,"
81977,sw2441,sd,"And , uh , it helped me out because I learned --"
12399,sw2594,sd,"Um , at T I they 're doing recycling ."
197504,sw3467,sd,"you know , occasionally , some ice skating will come on , on a Sunday or during the Olympics --"
161763,sw2820,sd,"I mean , there must be some , some , something ,"
189231,sw3902,sd,but she has adjusted beautifully .
6414,sw2308,sd,and she tries to make me feel really guilty .
27330,sw3271,sd,"and , uh , he 's really getting too old to take care of it ."
214074,sw3188,sd,"well , the first time it 'd probably would have taken me forever ,"
143713,sw2157,sd,I 'm --
81602,sw2434,sd,"Well , that 's what my husband ,"
91779,sw3148,sd,"it was actually , it was put on by the power companies and , about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was ,"
69161,sw2617,sd,"i- , it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have , from the people or the administration , either one ."
118292,sw3056,sd,"but , uh , I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time ."
102699,sw2102,sd,"But , for the most part , I try , I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they 're up ."
211821,sw2107,sd,"He jumped off the balcony actually , of a second story apartment ."
120500,sw3143,sd,but they spread out to cover more area
13540,sw2483,sd,"and we , we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one ."
176042,sw3246,sd,"That was our last tour , in Michigan ."
4565,sw2168,sd,"I have children even ,"
70458,sw2792,sd,"well , part of eighty-four to eighty-six I should say ."
163915,sw2691,sd,"-- and then , uh , the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway ."
115666,sw3030,sd,"It 's like , you know , if we can do it once every six months , we 're doing well ."
76348,sw3124,sd,I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes .
165373,sw3296,sd,And then I have a sister that lives in Austin .
79132,sw2835,sd,"and they were really just going on epidemiological , uh ,"
209944,sw3251,sd,and now it 's really growing
192177,sw2789,sd,"when I was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired , you know ."
211278,sw2060,sd,"The topic is to discuss the , uh , sources where I receive news ."
195269,sw4378,sd,"and they 'd lived in this , this old ,"
7906,sw2232,sd,and I know people that have done that .
105227,sw3012,sd,I just started doing this
96988,sw2314,sd,and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime
192601,sw4168,sd,and --
35830,sw2679,sd,"And they started doing this , like in the early , or in about the middle seventies ."
157912,sw2241,sd,"and then when it gets wet , you know , you do n't even want to get out in the yard ,"
202776,sw4928,sd,I got too much weight on right now .
186304,sw4153,sd,he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up .
75182,sw3155,sd,"That was kind of a funny movie with , uh , Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray ."
124318,sw3029,sd,I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all .
114364,sw2431,sd,"And then , uh , he talked about a van ,"
21765,sw2437,sd,and then they sell it to them .
19034,sw2543,sd,"and so now that I do have one , I just do n't automatically turn it on --"
16057,sw3657,sd,"so , I 've got a P C and a work station at work"
205995,sw3108,sd,"-- and he 's trying to find it ,"
25853,sw2898,sd,"I never heard MUMBLEx ,"
139735,sw2376,sd,"the city is going to leave , uh , receptacles at people 's home ."
163096,sw2874,sd,"its , its mouth was full of hooks ."
6581,sw3189,sd,"and so , they 're all kind of local and close ,"
31277,sw3203,sd,I know .
35065,sw2957,sd,"actually another one that I , a question I would have is ,"
39204,sw2693,sd,And you --
133837,sw2999,sd,"We have , well , we like a lot of gasoline credit cards ,"
185831,sw2945,sd,"Well , um , w- , we do a lot of things with them , you know ,"
1729,sw2325,sd,and they let you know
107882,sw3196,sd,"And they said , sure that 's no problem , but , you know , why do n't we consolidate your bills ,"
19646,sw2355,sd,"I just miss that ,"
105601,sw2962,sd,"I guess we always focus on criminal trials with th- , with the jury ."
152452,sw2171,sd,and I could n't think of anything at all .
209951,sw3251,sd,"-- but we 're still fighting bugs , and ready to change some of the , the summer flowers out --"
184819,sw3830,sd,"they come in there ,"
148464,sw3300,sd,"and , it , it had real good tips"
146519,sw3825,sd,"and the people who are down there , like , they 'll assign one person in the Utah area , one person in the Washington area"
146917,sw2259,sd,"Well , you know , there 's another aspect of this , too ."
163232,sw2842,sd,and I read her stories .
168654,sw2650,sd,"Uh , Australian shepherd ."
149885,sw2587,sd,"Uh , and they stayed active was the , uh , the military there . Taking supplies out to them in the desert ."
58271,sw2340,sd,"and I guess she , she had her own separate room ."
51362,sw2610,sd,"Uh , I work in metal fab"
152596,sw3524,sd,"I mean , I 've got a daughter that 's a sophomore at U T"
145324,sw2641,sd,"I had a pet rat , , for a while ,"
131056,sw3018,sd,"I , uh , I have enjoyed , uh , THIRTYSOMETHING --"
70541,sw2460,sd,"see I have , I have a tendency to , a , adopt teams when I wen , go to a tea- , uh , go to a town ."

55708,sw2983,sd,and I ca n't even hit the ball .
146076,sw2253,sd,whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller .
95514,sw2819,sd,"see I 'm what , I 'm about , uh , twenty-eight now"
7567,sw3424,sd,"And then , sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group , you know ."
111530,sw3097,sd,"So , in , in that , in that respect I am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit ."
188484,sw3917,sd,"So , I , you know , you pick up some traits from her and stuff ."
35891,sw2679,sd,"You get like , uh , a bite at , at the m , most ."
184876,sw4364,sd,"-- and , in fact , uh , it is actually prohibited"
91829,sw3148,sd,"That surprised me because I think ,"
119411,sw2797,sd,"than I was , uh , paying the , uh , property tax down there ."
109685,sw2300,sd,"but we just , we do n't have the income at this time really to have any , because we have three debts that we 're trying to pay off from both of our student loans ."
83952,sw2465,sd,I did n't even know they had anything like that .
133890,sw2999,sd,or this last month I mailed a check to them on the twenty-second
36462,sw2457,sd,And we have a lot of trees in our yard
91542,sw2285,sd,"And they said , no ,"
54709,sw2175,sd,"And plus , we like , we both like to cook ,"
103519,sw3666,sd,it 's forty a month .
74317,sw2719,sd,we got into the fitness center at Methodist
56881,sw3076,sd,but there were people who believed he could make a difference .
172035,sw3325,sd,I 'm not either
169779,sw2868,sd,"and then we were n't too for from the Appalachian Trail ,"
125333,sw2631,sd,so I guess she took off three all together
19698,sw2355,sd,"and I could n't , and I just could n't belie , you know ,"
52618,sw3361,sd,"You know , if I , uh --"
51063,sw3014,sd,I think I would opt to go with a bronze .
115605,sw2085,sd,"and it really carry some weight ,"
123145,sw3402,sd,"but I basically do n't do it every day ,"
136061,sw3802,sd,We spent a week with them .
118834,sw2537,sd,but I can understand why people would object .
68046,sw2032,sd,but other bands consider it like really hard rock .
165822,sw2634,sd,all of a sudden my combat in me goes up
133332,sw2387,sd,and he likes to do special music and stuff at church .
104328,sw4056,sd,"Uh , for the operating staff it 's on a seniority , it 's , you know , based on how long they 've worked there ."
11726,sw3554,sd,"Well , um , I have a , a , a former exercise program ."
20055,sw3054,sd,but it was there before they built the dam .
60649,sw2433,sd,"actually I was up on a ladder , and , uh , fell off ."
209627,sw2305,sd,"there was a woman ,"
67675,sw2383,sd,"I 'm in Texas too ,"
70796,sw4114,sd,"Y- , you know , you go even a few wi- , miles out and you got , uh , farms and everything"
16985,sw4709,sd,"after the merger , uh , you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road ."
156811,sw2678,sd,"I never really thought about that much ,"
13521,sw2483,sd,I do n't have C N N at home .
60579,sw2433,sd,"Well , what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas ,"
176736,sw2510,sd,"and I was n't really involved in the , the paper training ,"
107458,sw3596,sd,I 'll tell you that .
2647,sw2289,sd,they get a penny a can they handle .
198725,sw2061,sd,Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy .
65429,sw2533,sd,"but anyway , so they could really only have four members on the team ."
210950,sw4099,sd,-- and they ski .
154482,sw2603,sd,it will bother me .
167459,sw2469,sd,So we have n't reached a real agreement on that yet .
11240,sw3055,sd,"But she also had made , uh , flan , which is actually Spanish , I think ."
44146,sw2955,sd,like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome .
34940,sw2373,sd,"I mean , there 's just no one around ."
129452,sw2926,sd,"they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood ,"
163955,sw2691,sd,"Uh , our , our last house was n't too bad ,"
154333,sw2603,sd,"If , I like to have the T V on , because that usually keeps me , um , more occupied ."
189373,sw2395,sd,So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch .
95531,sw2819,sd,"You know , I used to live up north ."
17298,sw2191,sd,and it 's fun .
90714,sw4548,sd,"if it ever touched my fam- ,"
212252,sw3266,sd,"-- you have to be real careful all the , everything is baby proof ."
77409,sw3074,sd,"Although , they do the same thing ."
212583,sw4868,sd,"and you know , if , if something goes on sale and I do n't have the money , I still do n't buy it ."
97757,sw2648,sd,"you know , they 've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they do n't th- , th- ,"
127388,sw2726,sd,"But , uh , it 's , it 's nice"
214009,sw3188,sd,and it was like paint thinner .
83896,sw2465,sd,"Um , I do , um , television ratings"
4849,sw2711,sd,and I have n't really seen much .
86469,sw2479,sd,Galen just does n't go there three mornings a week .
64924,sw2782,sd,"now , I forget which way we do it ."
130328,sw2265,sd,"but I usually try to catch the ten o'clock or , um ,"
161071,sw3451,sd,"and it was a excellent ,"
87783,sw3565,sd,"Well , that 's the thing that surprised me , because once I got into the plumbing --"
54965,sw2175,sd,"So if , you know , if we want to drive , we pay our own insurance ,"
109045,sw2893,sd,"and last semester I had stopped working out 'cause I hurt myself and started smoking a lot ,"
79346,sw3342,sd,I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it .
185068,sw4312,sd,"Uh , uh , I like Tchaikovsky ."
43266,sw2767,sd,"I , but I do n't know that many men that have majored in engineering ,"
180917,sw2667,sd,"and of course while I 'm doing it I feel pretty good ,"
119821,sw2283,sd,"there 's even , there 's bad chemicals in those too ."
141875,sw2393,sd,"There are some oaks , magnolias , and like plum trees , peach trees ,"
196765,sw4688,sd,And that 's about it .
17097,sw3319,sd,"I , uh , watch them on T V a lot ."
72738,sw3691,sd,And I 'm a substitute teacher
184223,sw3073,sd,"That 's why I 'm surprised I like those two shows , because usually I like , you know , stuff that just ends sort of , that you just , you do n't have to ,"
46706,sw3064,sd,And so I 'm really looking forward to that .
197210,sw4877,sd,"I mean , first of all , uh , her children were sick all the time ."
122976,sw2647,sd,"and so maybe to me the key would be wh- , what is a chi- , the , the students needs ,"
131510,sw3003,sd,but .
85693,sw2472,sd,it just takes the time to cut everything up .
157000,sw3052,sd,and the wife said `` these are not his slacks ''
145833,sw4642,sd,And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars
161134,sw3332,sd,I have a couple of credit cards --
108976,sw2893,sd,"and you know , she would n't take no for an answer ."
195651,sw4320,sd,"but , every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides ,"
188320,sw2184,sd,"That reminds me of , uh ,"
140214,sw2570,sd,"If , if somebody would lay it out for me , then I did n't mind cutting it out and sewing it ."
150433,sw2078,sd,I like just looking at the billboards .
1544,sw2325,sd,That they would would be safe --
90436,sw2366,sd,"and it seems like almost a opposite ,"
6416,sw2308,sd,"I mean , if that was my mother , I would really feel a lot more responsible ."
194814,sw4129,sd,"Uh , I 'm a research engineer ,"
92375,sw2676,sd,"It is so cool , you wear a jacket , you know ."
7978,sw2770,sd,"they 'd take anything I think ,"
193062,sw3580,sd,"Well , you know , I had a car , uh , uh , a tire come off of a car ,"
16509,sw3136,sd,and it killed those too .
39733,sw3250,sd,"And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally , especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and --"
134704,sw2875,sd,"I think they are , I do n't know , a classic"
52865,sw2339,sd,And then one night we were camping
120975,sw2187,sd,and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham
15408,sw2707,sd,"azaleas grow all over ,"
123610,sw3092,sd,"Like in may case , I have three children --"
77207,sw2734,sd,but he has n't .
123178,sw3402,sd,"and , and like you said , the , the news shows that are , that are happening ,"
74583,sw2445,sd,"and some of them are n't ,"
135971,sw3802,sd,I own a sailboat that I --
98935,sw2137,sd,and I think they 've gotten a lot out of it .
337,sw2278,sd,"Um , I think they 're okay ,"
24462,sw3231,sd,"-- and , uh , I was really disappointed in it ,"
136894,sw3050,sd,"Miniature golf , there 's my game . Uh ."
149573,sw2067,sd,"It 's like ,"
183310,sw4133,sd,"Tsongas is also saying , you know , capital , make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer ."
50025,sw2862,sd,and it went right up over my head
113188,sw3421,sd,"I , I guess I have similarly broad tastes ."
111629,sw3097,sd,And I guarded my children 's rights for that
126881,sw2952,sd,We --
64275,sw3525,sd,"And we just have a ball ,"
154802,sw2584,sd,"As a matter of fact , my , my , you know , the majority of the amount of camping I 've done has been really roughing it ."
7603,sw3424,sd,MUMBLEx enthused and with it
8277,sw2534,sd,"Um , now the Himie , we 'll probably breed her a couple of times"
139515,sw3087,sd,"So I asked him if I could play the bass clarinet ,"
32123,sw2432,sd,Kind of like K Mart --
18491,sw4814,sd,"I mean , here 's , here 's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward , you know , getting the party nomination and , and preparing himself for the presidency"
139284,sw2630,sd,"and one of the things that he said is , he went to Pennsylvania this weekend"
152465,sw2171,sd,I do n't have too much of a green thumb either .
71283,sw2041,sd,"It says ever- , all sorts of factors go into health and there 's no reason to talk about one rather than another , so that they , they combined them all together ."
182877,sw2761,sd,"but , uh , I have a friend who , uh , is working on this project ."
42161,sw3716,sd,MUMBLEx I love barbecue .
100017,sw3093,sd,"We will head for , we will head for Florida , maybe in somewhat of an off season , instead of summer ."
140369,sw4821,sd,"But , uh , I like a little more indepth coverage"
85484,sw2472,sd,"and then I mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi- , and some cool whip ,"
183969,sw4366,sd,"And my , a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him ."
11877,sw3554,sd,"Fish is pretty good for you ,"
129690,sw2926,sd,"and something you have to consider , too , um , because I know a- , as a , as a ,"
175374,sw2331,sd,and we bought a house .
173997,sw3331,sd,"I have heard stories , uh , from other parents that I know of , their children are in high school --"
139204,sw2630,sd,"-- but he did go on college visits ,"
80374,sw2461,sd,"And we 're paying basketball people , you know , millions of dollars a year for , for what , you know ."
139324,sw2630,sd,And you 're going to get a little bit more input than --
54083,sw2780,sd,I have two sons living down there
182443,sw4682,sd,"And I said my goodness ,"
151859,sw2012,sd,and it was sort of exciting
106186,sw2806,sd,"well , the thing about them is that they hold so still you do n't notice that they 're there"
197740,sw4831,sd,"but his company is , is , uh , is , uh , closing up ."
60431,sw3260,sd,"So if they want to play , they have to play with mom and dad ."
116651,sw3131,sd,"they do n't get to see their children ,"
88709,sw2336,sd,"see , at the moment I 'm single ,"
84518,sw3223,sd,"Um , I , I enjoy those also , almost as , as much to a certain extent ."
95316,sw2785,sd,we 've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma .
165263,sw3296,sd,I 'm already home for the day .
118322,sw3056,sd,"and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY , uh ,"
54098,sw2780,sd,But
161366,sw3693,sd,"Well , I would , too , because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside , we 're finding out now that it 's not always on the inside --"
176947,sw2998,sd,"and the other will be going in September ,"
135507,sw2586,sd,"If we 're doing good , we catch a catfish or two once in a while ."
40641,sw3847,sd,"so I just bought that yesterday ,"
108373,sw3225,sd,So that 's a real easy thing for me .
10033,sw2716,sd,"and so no matter what happens to me , if I get in a car accident this afternoon , I have no way of , you know , no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical costs ,"
71977,sw3680,sd,"Well , the French went in and tried their old style warfare , and , uh , got soundly thrashed ."
159605,sw2466,sd,"Uh , He , he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE ."
190318,sw4341,sd,"And I know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , I would feel that I had the right to , to get revenge on them"

182413,sw4682,sd,"My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that 's guaranteed . Uh , James Avery ."
67809,sw3458,sd,"if I read three articles in , in , you know , one of the JOURNALs , I figure , you know , I did really well ."
178501,sw2547,sd,there has been a lot of speculative building .
175118,sw2970,sd,especially since a lot of us are engineers where I work .
92939,sw2598,sd,"I like the director a lot , um , a guy named Tim Burton ."
83969,sw2465,sd,but then he switched jobs .
141953,sw3002,sd,"you can get an idea of what 's going on ,"
25175,sw2889,sd,"And , uh , it spreads real evenly"
154532,sw2603,sd,"I just went and took the , because they were offering it as an opening benefit ,"
124780,sw2793,sd,"that just might not be something that everybody wants to do ,"
58788,sw3121,sd,"South Alabama ,"
25569,sw2991,sd,They usually have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word .
195267,sw4378,sd,"Well , it was , uh , for my friend 's parents ."
98031,sw2362,sd,"they go by a complete rote system ,"
125251,sw2631,sd,"and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school ,"
26351,sw3013,sd,"like , uh , for Memorial Day we had some friends over"
154637,sw3345,sd,"Well , I just , pretty , uh , little , you know , about everything ."
130668,sw2751,sd,Of course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore .
213922,sw3134,sd,"-- they left this morning for , uh , England ."
115772,sw3030,sd,"so ,"
133954,sw2999,sd,and they 're supposed to modify it .
214206,sw3324,sd,"And , course , when they got bigger , uh , they were both quite into sports"

189201,sw3902,sd,"This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker ,"
32159,sw2432,sd,"and you just feed your cans slowly into the slot ,"
12310,sw2594,sd,and we let the kids get the money for that .
17858,sw3282,sd,"I think , um , I think I was worn o- , worn out from Middle East after the war ."
83104,sw2703,sd,"but I 'm , uh , I 'm mostly a baseball fan ."
11869,sw3554,sd,"Well , there 's a lot of fat in meat ."
211340,sw2060,sd,I 'm from Dallas

116797,sw3096,sd,"And , uh ,"
4741,sw2711,sd,really did .
138118,sw2248,sd,It 's a lot easier then .

49494,sw3028,sd,"Well , I had the ,"
118688,sw2766,sd,I do n't know the answers to those questions .
132226,sw2185,sd,you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere .
172142,sw2330,sd,and then the rest will be without rain .
31569,sw3527,sd,"that 's what we did when we first moved in , too ."
141165,sw2221,sd,"But ,"
7584,sw3424,sd,We 'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred .

50034,sw2862,sd,"and it was , uh , it was funny , I tell you ."
197758,sw2145,sd,"the equality of , uh , the roles now between the sexes , I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war , especially compared with , uh , the Vietnam war"
156582,sw3360,sd,we got a sales tax .
148334,sw3300,sd,"I read , uh , a lot of Steven King , Dean R Koontz , uh --"
77149,sw2734,sd,I do believe that 's in .

12201,sw2827,sd,"actually it was a private course ,"
92687,sw4072,sd,-- so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really is n't --
36206,sw2389,sd,"So I think that we did come a long way in the sense that we are allowed to vote in , you know , like you say , we 're out in the labor force , but I think we 've lost something too ."

157799,sw2442,sd,"You know , I usually do it because I want to , because I know it 's good for me , not because , I do n't feel obligated to do it ."
13609,sw2368,sd,I have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house --
61007,sw2423,sd,"It 's , I 've never heard of it ,"

10355,sw2768,sd,"They 're making straight A 's ,"
195042,sw4181,sd,so they --

154543,sw2603,sd,"Like I said , I like it ."
58500,sw2467,sd,"and so it 's a cheaper place to live , as far as the insurance company 's concerned ,"

22935,sw2621,sd,I thought he was kind of cocky or something .
177807,sw4608,sd,And then I left right in the middle of it .
191673,sw4104,sd,so --
126428,sw3828,sd,"I mean , what he does , the chief said is he just merely goes back to his , his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate"
156296,sw2932,sd,and I just lucked out and walked into this one
75240,sw3425,sd,"he gets up about five and , and --"
101186,sw2073,sd,"but , um ,"
7495,sw3921,sd,I do n't put that corn meal on them .
212478,sw3080,sd,"It 's , I guess , pretty , pretty healthy ,"
144573,sw3082,sd,"But , um , they have various organized ,"

35383,sw3257,sd,"They , they rotate those around ,"
48553,sw3734,sd,"I 'm five four ,"
214344,sw3887,sd,"But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together , the worse it gets ."
83566,sw2672,sd,But I did n't realize that was the biggest waste of water .
37560,sw3352,sd,"and I try to ,"

146058,sw2253,sd,"Well , I 've gone to the point where my husband , my husband travels , I get out like , you know , two or three books ."
74988,sw2160,sd,"and I go , oh you did , MUMBLEx you make very good money up here ."
210634,sw3138,sd,and I 'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother .
204206,sw2406,sd,"I thought the book was better than the movie ,"
90686,sw4548,sd,"the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I do n't really think it , uh , I do n't really think it 's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else ."
165870,sw3206,sd,but it slipped my mind .
185417,sw4108,sd,"and then , so if she ever does become ill , uh , it will be like family around her ."
63231,sw2545,sd,it was a big change .
152358,sw2171,sd,"Everybody I know has been ,"
22447,sw3788,sd,I know I 'm heavily involved in other things --

104454,sw4723,sd,"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to ,"
9431,sw2871,sd,"I really need to go see the original one ,"
22805,sw2621,sd,"As a matter of fact , there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job ."
5065,sw3233,sd,"and , uh , I 'm trying , um , to , to , uh , furnish a home --"
81200,sw2229,sd,I ca n't remember what time .
25018,sw3162,sd,and it 's not highly publicized .
34998,sw2957,sd,"and right now I 'm kind of stuck because I 'd like to have children ,"
13982,sw3326,sd,"And I , I do n't even know what they 're talking about ."
176051,sw3246,sd,but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes --
127171,sw2952,sd,and I bought one of those latch hook rug kits .
60769,sw2433,sd,"but , you know , sometime when I ask , I just feel like , boy , am I stupid or what ."
129774,sw2736,sd,"and we 're , we 're thinking about buying another sedan , uh , probably next year ."
165629,sw2634,sd,"Well , me being from Texas ,"

157929,sw2241,sd,"we 've , we 've got mayb- , maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil ,"
57024,sw2237,sd,"-- and I put that down ,"
97261,sw2743,sd,and it was an expensive dress .
133413,sw2387,sd,"But , uh , then I must say they all kind of like a variety of music , which is nice ,"
32437,sw2884,sd,"but ,"
57144,sw2237,sd,"I just pretend they 're not there ,"
84140,sw2465,sd,and I 've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise .
188433,sw4339,sd,"and , this is a rear wheel drive model ."
84105,sw2465,sd,"I worked for this company before I had my first daughter ,"

63997,sw4363,sd,"To be honest with you , I , I probably watch , uh , college a little bit more than I do pro ."
137365,sw3591,sd,"One was that I take care of my mother ,"

208703,sw4033,sd,it 's like sixteen hundred days or something .

140585,sw2690,sd,"it 's like if I pay for a movie channel , then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them ."
54413,sw2879,sd,and Texas is having a problem right now
15431,sw2707,sd,"-- uh , they do have some pine forest areas in wes- , in wes , in east Texas --"
11578,sw3760,sd,So we learn different crafts like that --
76430,sw3124,sd,and the kids when they were young would just go nuts .

91850,sw3148,sd,It 's just we ca n't control it .
127545,sw2726,sd,"but now they 've got one in Killeen ,"
83263,sw2703,sd,"And , and that was their main , main money making , you know ,"
37969,sw2426,sd,"And it was really , what I felt was kind of cynical"

143883,sw2157,sd,"and they , um , if they 're not going to use them they 'll give them to somebody else ."
131918,sw2984,sd,"and , you know ,"
174495,sw2910,sd,"which sort of gives you a different slant , than ,"
179665,sw4801,sd,"So they 're pretty hip on it too , I guess ."
142186,sw3020,sd,"and so , hopefully , we 'll get to travel a little bit too ."
28218,sw2101,sd,"He 's the husband of ,"

211906,sw2107,sd,and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery
212171,sw3266,sd,and one of my daughters has one
63135,sw2545,sd,she just finished up her Bachelor 's degree --
91285,sw2540,sd,"um , and I do n't think I probably ever would , um , although I would like to know how to handle one ,"
62432,sw2051,sd,-- and these kids were more foulmouthed than I 've ever been .
180078,sw4792,sd,I was just thinking
111009,sw3453,sd,so I like a little heavier car
142999,sw2405,sd,"and it printed out like ten checks ,"
7260,sw3676,sd,"it was n't , you know , blood and guts and violence and , and car chases type thing ."
66614,sw2521,sd,"But ,"
214038,sw3188,sd,"and there was wall paper ,"
77677,sw4733,sd,"My son said that , came home"
134945,sw2875,sd,"and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything ,"
53814,sw2155,sd,"and it 's just for elderly people , you know ,"
63506,sw3051,sd,"I just do n't see the designer 's ,"
43833,sw2995,sd,and I do n't understand what their need to know is .
104128,sw3049,sd,"Well , you know , I think I read about that too ."
157662,sw3021,sd,and now the young boy wants to know
10735,sw2090,sd,"And um , I made , uh , like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that ,"
108699,sw2515,sd,"It , and it goes toward different things ,"
145122,sw2641,sd,I like them .
123480,sw2482,sd,she 's just like him .
145374,sw2641,sd,it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage
189299,sw3902,sd,"And I guess , uh , I do n't know how old you are ."
9086,sw3956,sd,probably so .
62523,sw2499,sd,"Uh , --"
93603,sw3195,sd,"Um , several years we did n't ,"
140221,sw2570,sd,and she paid me I think like two dollars a pair to make her some pants .
199017,sw2539,sd,we used to play ball a lot
61025,sw2423,sd,"but I do n't , I , I 'm so , uh , timid when it comes to starting a business ."
4598,sw2168,sd,it beeps in at ten minutes .
33853,sw2386,sd,MUMBLEx I have n't quite figured that out .
199793,sw2399,sd,"And , uh , I 'm not I 'm not terribly in favor of them ."
171509,sw2439,sd,So it was that same car .
89786,sw3081,sd,I thought maybe that was the trick .
94541,sw2485,sd,and it just kept coming on up through the generations .
58221,sw2340,sd,"So I do , love to see young kids go and , and men take the pets and everything ."
110840,sw3190,sd,"we do ,"
108486,sw3359,sd,"I was going to ,"
99463,sw3850,sd,"He was a movie director ,"
100372,sw2397,sd,"and so , you know , those do n't take much time at all ."
158727,sw3517,sd,"Now they 've gotten larger and larger as , as they have developed the land ."
72707,sw3691,sd,"Have n't had any parakeets for quite a while ,"
8792,sw2354,sd,"-- and , so I have a real , you know , heart for them ,"
107507,sw3596,sd,"Lights up the whole sky and even on a , on a ,"
26773,sw2064,sd,we have been really fortunate
161638,sw3004,sd,"and then we 'd sit down ,"
130457,sw3371,sd,I 've heard the construction is pretty good on Fox and Jacobs .
160291,sw2427,sd,"I do n't ,"
106800,sw2450,sd,"like tornado weather and tornado warnings ,"
145767,sw4642,sd,"Actually , uh , that is really a sore spot with me ."
10097,sw2716,sd,"So on top of the federal tax on gasoline ,"
29421,sw3764,sd,"-- I will always remember ,"
206258,sw3152,sd,"and that 's , those are , that 's my favorite type ."
88298,sw4859,sd,"and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the , uh , various , uh , of the articles and the front section"
100216,sw2397,sd,"I suspect you ,"
100902,sw2832,sd,We 've been doing a lot of remodeling .
142608,sw3397,sd,They 've got the U T Health Science Center out there also .
59444,sw3723,sd,"and , uh , I went , uh , for a little while , uh ."
140091,sw2570,sd,"and I crocheted a blanket for my sister 's baby ,"
22071,sw2960,sd,and I will let him watch that every once in a while .
34164,sw2190,sd,"but , you know , there 's some argument that in , in , in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that that 's the , uh , the pine trees giving off pollution"
106890,sw3072,sd,"Um , usually when we go , we go to Colorado , to Estes Park area ."
135683,sw2586,sd,We did not know what to do about it .
17605,sw3158,sd,"I do n't know if it 's looking at the little th- , things every time ."
126368,sw2927,sd,"and col- , uh , it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado ."
59200,sw3107,sd,"but , uh ,"
152410,sw2171,sd,"And I talked to this person who I gathered from speaking to her , that , that she and her family just did n't have much ,"
117631,sw2514,sd,"and they , they live there"
214036,sw3188,sd,"I went around the trim ,"
116636,sw3131,sd,it 's walls
42438,sw3521,sd,"Uh , I , I subscribe to three newspapers ."
186542,sw4617,sd,I got called
91349,sw2540,sd,"and then you come here in , in the Dallas area , um ,"
145067,sw2372,sd,"I worked at the , uh ,"
208943,sw3508,sd,I do find that I do n't have as much to throw away --
73394,sw3586,sd,"Oh , little bit of embroidery work , once in a while ."
50727,sw4681,sd,"so , I do n't know where the answer is"
16712,sw2379,sd,"I had the impression ,"
189942,sw3086,sd,I 'm at home .
43911,sw2995,sd,"Like the product I sell , uh , I sell mostly to older people which ca n't get it in a normal public situation ."
92537,sw2676,sd,"Uh , I , I would cheerfully live there ."
92694,sw4072,sd,The radio does n't really have much news sometimes .
144855,sw3584,sd,"And the side that 's on the , uh , the other side is about six feet high ."
205801,sw3781,sd,"And I think the service charge is pretty low , too ,"
203448,sw2837,sd,"And , uh ,"
189258,sw3902,sd,and doctors are available if they need them .
195234,sw4378,sd,and it really did n't give a very good finish
54730,sw2175,sd,exactly .
83448,sw4725,sd,"I 'm , I 'm five or six MUMBLEx years before I 'm eligible to retire"
6557,sw3189,sd,"Well , we do n't really get together ,"
87585,sw2020,sd,Jimi Hendrix was the original .
169813,sw2868,sd,"I think the , the minimum age for diving is ,"
70310,sw2792,sd,"That was one of the books I read this year ,"
94785,sw2485,sd,"But , it turned out so much better like that ."
3963,sw2506,sd,"but if I did it , it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes ."
76448,sw3124,sd,"And I remember getting up and somebody telling me , hey , better wait to go to work because the roads are all , you know , snow ."
104852,sw2938,sd,"Now of course , there 's , you know , T I is here , Oscar Mayer --"
83344,sw2703,sd,"Uh , I was listening to something on the radio --"
172906,sw2525,sd,"And while he was gone , he had looked , went looking for a job and stopped at the store ,"
172165,sw2330,sd,"I mean , any other time of year , that 's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold ."
56215,sw3185,sd,"so , I , I like ,"
14324,sw2930,sd,"I grew up in Louisville , Kentucky"
184276,sw3073,sd,"the first one we saw , um , they were , it , it involved a tradition of when a per- , person reaches seventy-five ,"
135796,sw2586,sd,"It seems like the success ratio , the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there ."
29171,sw2292,sd,I do n't ever want to have to worry about that .
181846,sw3633,sd,"That 's one nice thing , is they 're real good about replacing it ."
148372,sw3300,sd,I 've never read anything by him .
146377,sw2965,sd,so I really ca n't complain about this one .
118974,sw2537,sd,"but the , the prescription has run out you still had some left"
158625,sw2608,sd,"And , uh , they were cooking the stuff , you know , while we were , we went on this boat ride ."
177176,sw4886,sd,"I used to live in Dallas . In Arlington , actually ."
62475,sw2051,sd,"And the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people ."
18658,sw4703,sd,and I know that companies do .
40530,sw2954,sd,"But I have never seen them ,"
159211,sw2526,sd,"Wow , I have n't seen those ."
140816,sw2178,sd,Bad .
152130,sw3993,sd,"That 's why I brought , bought the sprayer --"
25234,sw3230,sd,"the old , old stuff that came out , I think it was , was it , oh , jeez , came out with some of that , Hank Williams ,"
181845,sw3633,sd,But they were real good about replacing it .
120252,sw3090,sd,"and I 'm ,"
139979,sw2376,sd,"I ca n't either ,"
110679,sw3190,sd,my husband 's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maize land .
185299,sw4628,sd,I 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that .
138868,sw2086,sd,and --
57019,sw2237,sd,"-- and then I put , uh , like , a black plastic ,"
77790,sw2501,sd,"Oh , there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he 's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap"
190597,sw4148,sd,"and , uh , and he held on"
198862,sw4090,sd,"-- and he works , and my husband works full times days"
80048,sw2015,sd,"I do n't know how much clearer it can be ,"
63906,sw2177,sd,we did go see DANCES WITH WOLVES
122776,sw3659,sd,"You know , it would still be more convenient than what we have now ."
126309,sw2927,sd,"Actually , though , it was a lot rainier here in the winter , uh , we came back last August ."
46185,sw3104,sd,and they build and rebuild non jet engines .
69169,sw2617,sd,and those guys were there doing their duty .
135061,sw3105,sd,"I had a friend who was a police officer , who was killed in the line of duty ."
204383,sw2093,sd,"Usually single crochet would , is , is always starts it off ."
70433,sw2792,sd,"So , I 've only been in Texas three years ."
113397,sw2969,sd,"And , we- , everybody down here calls these flags . Uh , the irises I guess , uh ,"
34499,sw3647,sd,and I 'm Brian .
149685,sw4812,sd,"So , uh , it was one of those things where you go through the , the general battery of all their tests"
161562,sw3004,sd,"and so she called and said things were okay , settled down and was all right ."
170745,sw4055,sd,and they do a lot of camping with the scouts --
7993,sw2770,sd,"when I had a Cocker Spaniel it , it was an outdoor dog"
80433,sw2461,sd,"but , uh , I can definitely , uh , see on down the road , you know , where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that 's going to be a definite concern ."
195812,sw3144,sd,"They had a free showing at the Berkeley , um , United Artist ."
195190,sw4378,sd,I still am really .
181432,sw4092,sd,"Not really ,"
196578,sw3133,sd,"-- and , and I agree with what you said that it 's , uh ,"
185875,sw2945,sd,"But my , my wife was , uh ,"
90331,sw4071,sd,but it 's not much .
124150,sw3777,sd,"I , I , I rather enjoy the COSBY SHOW ."
164307,sw2436,sd,-- so I 'm kind of out of it .
195382,sw2546,sd,"and the prison system are just , you know ,"
141135,sw2221,sd,"they can go to their regular job ,"
128406,sw3911,sd,"when I was growing up my mom worked too ,"
148152,sw4077,sd,"that , that really does scare me . People , you know , that have guns"
8749,sw2354,sd,"Um , I 've got a , uh , small distributorship , uh ."
191698,sw4104,sd,and then we come back for a year .
109210,sw2893,sd,I 've thought about it several times
139034,sw3234,sd,My mother did not like cats .
9584,sw3903,sd,"Uh , I do enjoy , uh , sewing ,"
21301,sw4078,sd,That 's just what we called them .
200156,sw2729,sd,He loved it .
12151,sw2827,sd,"and I 've made some of it before as well ,"
84903,sw2527,sd,"but it 's , it 's quite bearable"
1559,sw2325,sd,"Uh , I mean , she loved the kids"
182970,sw3205,sd,I mean we 've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything
125091,sw2019,sd,"So , she 's a genuine Chowperd ."
62575,sw2499,sd,"There was a couple of others that are out ,"
112996,sw2579,sd,"and , uh , but , uh , northern Indiana , has many tornadoes come roaring across ."
213152,sw3142,sd,"or it 's , it 's a good change and , a good change from cooking and eating at home"
213116,sw2772,sd,and I guess I 'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it 's like .
49359,sw3028,sd,"and it , it was just fabulous ."
161354,sw3693,sd,"I 'm , I 'm glad too ."
69337,sw2617,sd,Giving a soapbox to stand on .
101770,sw3254,sd,I 'm in Texas .
41031,sw3570,sd,"It 's , it 's well worth the time and effort ."
119598,sw2797,sd,"They actually had to g , take a driving test on the tractor ,"
119589,sw2797,sd,"they had an ag course , uh ,"
5979,sw3265,sd,"Uh , at that time was the same car"
143599,sw3286,sd,"So , when you were giving your answer I was thinking , is this a Texan I 'm talking to ? ."
139292,sw2630,sd,I think it backfired .
128356,sw2122,sd,"Because of , of their , you know ,"
136522,sw3000,sd,"And , uh , most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason ."
44089,sw2955,sd,"That the people that I know that it did ,"
180767,sw2667,sd,and I kind of use that as an excuse .
58290,sw2340,sd,"He , he had him late in life ,"
1929,sw2788,sd,and he was going to school at five .
46205,sw3104,sd,"they kind of had that ,"
122070,sw2181,sd,it was all bloodless --
17828,sw3908,sd,"and it , it really still bothers me ."
143186,sw2405,sd,"Well , you know , we , my parents were divorced"
35529,sw3272,sd,I have a daughter that 's frustrated .
162634,sw2921,sd,"I hear the ,"
157073,sw3052,sd,she really was not aware of what she was doing .
59385,sw3692,sd,"He , uh --"
204414,sw2093,sd,"but I , I 've got , s- , I 've put them , I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because I , there is no way that I can eat all of those"
87043,sw3200,sd,One time we tried something that really worked
82866,sw2503,sd,Alfie did .
48158,sw2744,sd,and you were saying that you do n't appreciate education until you get out
54115,sw2780,sd,Well
198118,sw2028,sd,"and so , I had , uh , I had thought a little bit about it , um ,"
26352,sw3013,sd,"and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph 's meat marinate ,"
60568,sw2433,sd,I do n't use the free weights
163610,sw2909,sd,"so he had to ,"
29288,sw2292,sd,I mean they 're going through some tough times --
31656,sw3293,sd,"And , uh , that got kind of rough sometimes ."
8923,sw2354,sd,"so sometimes I get bogged down in the , you know , in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking ,"
130660,sw2751,sd,"But the Explorer , I mean , you 're sitting up on top of everything"
27034,sw2821,sd,They are good .
38667,sw3496,sd,Very clean .
189334,sw3902,sd,"My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety , ninety-one ."
81720,sw2434,sd,we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER .
47508,sw2830,sd,we do n't
181308,sw3067,sd,"And now when they come together it 's , it 's generally , you know ,"
19442,sw2355,sd,"We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a , just had a new baby ,"
199297,sw4137,sd,"Tight turns , hard acceleration ."
194211,sw4379,sd,But that 's completely up to me how I do that .
211110,sw3821,sd,"and finally they realized that they were , they were abusing them and were n't going to get out of the hole"
154580,sw2603,sd,"Um , I get bored very easily ."
153363,sw3688,sd,"Um , our last , we 've , we 've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus ."
74118,sw2719,sd,I could do it in twenty-eight minutes .
175410,sw2331,sd,"I , uh , I 've got my wife motivated about it , um --"
93226,sw2828,sd,"instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the , uh , the teacher 's in the middle ."
9405,sw2871,sd,a friend of mine saw it
19699,sw2355,sd,"I was from New York and so , you know , we road the bus ."
39929,sw2511,sd,"But then when he 's finished he 's , he always says , well , now you owe me three hundred dollars ."
77239,sw2734,sd,"Well , the ,"
156935,sw3052,sd,and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home .
160641,sw3419,sd,"They , they , they 're just spoiled rotten ,"
124197,sw3777,sd,"I always like ,"
144653,sw3082,sd,and this year they 're all excited .
23282,sw2959,sd,"Uh , and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there ."
88667,sw2336,sd,"if it 's Chevrolet , I just will not touch it ."
25137,sw2889,sd,"But outside of , outside of art class in , in school , I , I stopped doing most of that , unless I , I mean , like he has a computer ,"
211305,sw2060,sd,and like you I listened to radio on my job at work .
52073,sw3709,sd,"it is like an exercise in itself ,"
15643,sw3166,sd,they almost look neon .
48891,sw2149,sd,"but I ca n't ,"
164969,sw3727,sd,like we do n't really ski .
135575,sw2586,sd,You fish upstream .
98882,sw2275,sd,I 'm not into rock stars --

83783,sw4698,sd,"Uh , so I let my son do it"
13650,sw2368,sd,"we , uh , we lived out of state for a while and came back"
82495,sw2131,sd,"I ca n't remember how far in advance we reserved ,"
97595,sw3503,sd,It was like last like year they had forty-nine
154627,sw3345,sd,We 're supposed to talk about current events .
118777,sw2900,sd,"Well I ,"

116019,sw2620,sd,Well I live in mine .

11051,sw4721,sd,"But still there are , there are other people there doing the , doing the same thing ."
58542,sw2467,sd,Moved down there in eighty-seven

13088,sw4630,sd,Two newspapers in the morning .

16838,sw3738,sd,it 's kind of an interesting topic
10432,sw2768,sd,It would be a last resort .
117874,sw3353,sd,"Oh , we take little nature hikes"
202740,sw4928,sd,By the time I get back from classes it 's late at night
94178,sw2602,sd,"In Granada , in October , twenty-fifth , eighty-three , we invaded the place ."
177208,sw3168,sd,and they do have that at his place of employment
102020,sw3245,sd,but I sure never wear them .
158906,sw3663,sd,"for a good three , four weeks we have over a hundred degrees ."
73341,sw3750,sd,"You know , she 's got one of these huge Winnebago 's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning , color T V , microwave oven --"
104888,sw2938,sd,I did n't know that .
120657,sw4675,sd,"and I would know okay , you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it ."
146758,sw3303,sd,"Uh , well , where I 'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference"
30250,sw3852,sd,"but we , they did n't run it ."

138904,sw2086,sd,"I did n't like her desserts very well ,"
84543,sw3223,sd,"I live in Garland ,"
72655,sw3691,sd,"I said , otherwise I 'm going to give it to this other man ."

158246,sw2022,sd,"to , put it , we 're putting it in C D 's right now ,"
175466,sw2331,sd,We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not .
192467,sw4168,sd,"Uh , I , I like all kinds ."
122841,sw3659,sd,That would be easy .
87823,sw3565,sd,it was flat --
4126,sw2506,sd,"I 'm a real , um , scaredy when it comes to heights"
11627,sw3760,sd,"and I stopped because it was so ,"
120898,sw4726,sd,"like , I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old ."
150609,sw2078,sd,"And , everybody else that I 've talked to has been right around here ."
127418,sw2726,sd,and Steve said we 'll I 'll buy a bigger house

94054,sw2877,sd,"Well he just can ,"
77914,sw3988,sd,I play guitar --

96786,sw2299,sd,"they 're now starting to make them , you know , the packages out of recycled paper ,"
157800,sw2442,sd,I enjoy it .
95148,sw2435,sd,But I 'm glad I did n't .
120180,sw3090,sd,and our daughter graduated this year
202420,sw4150,sd,So this is the big issue with us . Although I do n't recall marking it on my little things to talk about
162195,sw2897,sd,So apparently it costs less that way .
212880,sw2772,sd,"So I was used to the heat , out here right now ,"
214093,sw3188,sd,"So , there 's a whole bunch of people ."
142663,sw3646,sd,"and just , he was just ahead at an early age"
40414,sw2954,sd,I think my dad put some .
54644,sw2879,sd,"and you 're thinking , oh , you would not only would you not want to be a victim"
168887,sw2650,sd,"The backyard , it 's really big , too , for him to run in and stuff ."
85452,sw2472,sd,"Oh , so it kind of browns"
179438,sw2568,sd,I hear that 's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video .
180278,sw2627,sd,My dad would n't know what to do .
15319,sw2707,sd,"I guess , that I have n't been able to actually participate ."
145429,sw2641,sd,"I mean , it w- , it was in the , yeah , it was almost like October of eighty-five ,"
74667,sw2445,sd,"and , um , up here we have , uh , we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime ."
26113,sw2967,sd,And I wondered who it was too .
107546,sw3596,sd,I 've driven through it several times .
184339,sw3073,sd,"it , it , they , they 're trying to liken the , the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW ."
44258,sw3703,sd,"It 's a , um , it 's a Mexican restaurant off of Central ."
146329,sw2965,sd,"Anyway , ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer"
203994,sw3495,sd,"and this lady was going to work ,"
136930,sw3050,sd,"but , they say the course is very , is , is , is pretty tough , pretty challenging ."
148199,sw3268,sd,"And , uh , uh , the , the waves were huge ."
186256,sw4082,sd,"So , if at a particular time , you wanted to get the latest and greatest news --"
16125,sw4758,sd,"Uh , I also take BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS ."
137414,sw3591,sd,I agree there 's a lot of options .
96466,sw2851,sd,"They would n't accept my , uh , T I N number ,"
197930,sw2028,sd,"no rain in the last month , I do n't think ."
119416,sw2797,sd,"And , uh , the tax was administered by , uh , the , uh , rental company that actually was managing the apartments"
93571,sw3513,sd,but --
131524,sw3003,sd,We have definitely put a lot of use in on ours
27022,sw2821,sd,"there 's a lot of nice barbecue places here ,"
210845,sw4099,sd,and then you just go in whenever you can .
47351,sw2830,sd,"and she , I should n't talk about this but she was , pretend she was a television show ,"
99436,sw3850,sd,"Well , it seems like they always --"
39924,sw2511,sd,I know I do n't .
205078,sw2708,sd,I had n't heard that .
19370,sw3774,sd,"-- and so it 's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools do n't have fences at all ,"
1407,sw2325,sd,I have a two year old and a three and a half year old .
156264,sw2932,sd,"It started out life as a three bedroom house , and now has no two car garage and has , uh , the two extra rooms enclosed ."
110685,sw3190,sd,"Oh , we 've been there ."
48372,sw3735,sd,"but when I sewed it up , the face of it looked like a mouse ."
62995,sw2455,sd,"But , uh , I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things ."
167985,sw2111,sd,like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk .
150922,sw3313,sd,but I really do n't know what they can do .
211649,sw3925,sd,I like it .
6876,sw3019,sd,and I like it just for the noise .
203190,sw3120,sd,"I have two daughters ,"
195857,sw3144,sd,and I went
35745,sw2679,sd,"If , if you ever get a chance to buy one of those , I think it was , uh , twenty dollars , for , uh , I do n't remember how many pounds it was ."
192914,sw3435,sd,"I 'm going to do it right , and see if I can actually play this game or not ."
23743,sw3214,sd,"And I thought , Why buy this ?"
167148,sw3041,sd,I 'm just out of school
10215,sw2768,sd,Our group does a church service once a month .
159798,sw2504,sd,"but it , it 's really bad here ."
34156,sw2190,sd,they did some tracers
130883,sw3340,sd,"Another thing that we saw here recently . One of , some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a , a train track ran through --"
7847,sw2232,sd,"-- now , it was , it was in general , bad ,"
119001,sw2537,sd,"certain medicines were , were legal now"
94346,sw2876,sd,it was n't very well advertised --
65587,sw2010,sd,"I thought , no , it 's really funny ."
166994,sw3041,sd,"it was kind of ,"
197105,sw3389,sd,I 'd like to see some more teams get in .
60589,sw2433,sd,"and it was about four inches deep and then about , oh a seventy degree angle ."
131872,sw2984,sd,"and I 've got some problems with , uh , two trees in my front yard ,"
159022,sw2526,sd,"I , uh , I 've had no problems with my Subaru ,"
63591,sw3051,sd,"and everything that I have been saying ,"
70899,sw4114,sd,"Denver 's that , that real good e- , that real good , uh , example of sitting in a valley , kind of like Mexico City does , I guess ."
214228,sw3324,sd,"But , uh , we , we still , uh , oh , like to pack up , you know , just go someplace for the day --"
75136,sw3155,sd,"I think I heard that was just one , was just out ."
94540,sw2485,sd,"and , um , it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had"
197159,sw4877,sd,She has a private baby-sitter .
82150,sw2724,sd,"and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it ,"
130708,sw2751,sd,"and I 've told them that , matter of fact I got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division , their still concerned about my attitude"
109802,sw2300,sd,"I can have ,"
63796,sw2177,sd,"And when they were trying to film that , the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young 's buffalo ."
71859,sw2858,sd,"I work part-time also ,"
138598,sw4940,sd,I 've seen that .
44320,sw3703,sd,"and we 've , we 've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it ."
33949,sw2386,sd,So my husband 's just discouraged me on those things .
97837,sw2648,sd,"and then , and , channel thirteen they 're really , um , emphasizing the problem with acid rain , you know ,"
189434,sw2395,sd,"-- and it was hosted by Peter Jennings ,"
3899,sw2506,sd,"And , uh , seems like we 're always working on it , as I 'm sure ,"
177325,sw3168,sd,"That look like , it looks like a sticker"
199616,sw2628,sd,"just like now , you know , there 's , there 's so much more now ."
154068,sw2154,sd,"so , we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like GLAMOUR or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED ."
61651,sw2619,sd,I mean even Britain has converted over
89923,sw2756,sd,"It 's this house built on , on a waterfall"
202735,sw4928,sd,"I should , I know"
20131,sw2478,sd,"I ca n't remember who it was ,"
28077,sw3665,sd,"And , uh , on Sunday , used to be on Sunday nights , now I ca n't figure out where they 've moved it ."
83821,sw4376,sd,and so I really would n't know .
19912,sw3001,sd,"and , um , he seems to be very happy , you know ."
131129,sw3018,sd,"But , it 's , uh , it 's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house"
125908,sw3791,sd,"We , we either crock pot deer"
140530,sw2690,sd,"But , even I 've said , hey look , you 're fascinated with this , you sit and listen to the Cowboys ."
27591,sw2723,sd,I have the regular .
95328,sw2785,sd,"they 're , they 're women ."
80467,sw2461,sd,"we did n't , we did n't even think about it , you know ."
74631,sw2445,sd,"and I fluff out in it , in the backyard and stuff ,"
71489,sw2220,sd,"and not many things you can play that 'll , you know , people will sit there and sing along to"
8276,sw2534,sd,and they 're very inquisitive .
148444,sw3300,sd,Some of it really --
163402,sw2909,sd,"And if , if they have jobs , you know , I hear the story that they 're taking away American jobs ."
116872,sw3096,sd,And so . But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job .
44485,sw2950,sd,"Well , they are not allowed to water ,"
4392,sw2168,sd,And I have some real hang-ups .
135298,sw2661,sd,and seven courses is n't what I usually look for .
20741,sw2812,sd,but it 's depressing too .
134667,sw2875,sd,"and , uh , she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was ,"
142658,sw3646,sd,and --
213054,sw2772,sd,"but it 's nothing like , I guess , San Antonio Summers ,"
103347,sw4149,sd,because --
7948,sw2770,sd,I 've had several cats .
129382,sw2926,sd,"especially in those areas , it 's , um , I kn , it 's , it 's almost fifty per cent foreign , like forty-eight per cent ,"
191174,sw3075,sd,"They , uh , they 've been in San Diego for the last few years ,"
68942,sw3187,sd,and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility .
103059,sw2197,sd,so I 'm actually managing to do this with zero debt .
194051,sw3707,sd,"-- and we took ,"
16337,sw3059,sd,"Meanwhile , I sat through the movie and said well , when are you , when are you supposed to start crying , you know ."
145638,sw3699,sd,"and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled , uh , codes and , and , and stuff ,"
132888,sw4443,sd,You hear about Japan .
74103,sw2719,sd,"You name it , all kinds of stuff , flower beds ."
95315,sw2785,sd,"what I would like ,"
149913,sw2587,sd,we 're getting some flooding .
129411,sw2926,sd,"I d , I do , I do know a few people and have been ,"
66790,sw4659,sd,"I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it were n't for the fact that we ,"
181842,sw3633,sd,"and so I finally got her a Ken doll ,"
94618,sw2485,sd,It had gotten so big that they had it at the church .
17754,sw3908,sd,"Uh , the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know , in their , the society we live in ."
169354,sw3099,sd,my husband 's parents are in France .
89338,sw4728,sd,Did n't do any damage to it .
130885,sw3340,sd,-- and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train .
96049,sw4876,sd,I 'm with the university actually --
104800,sw2938,sd,"so , I mean Amarillo ."
16243,sw3059,sd,FLATLINERS .
212534,sw4868,sd,"and , you know , and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them . You see ,"
24302,sw3247,sd,Capital punishment .
13802,sw2368,sd,"we have a dog ,"
93629,sw3195,sd,"but for the most part , our mortgage and our utilities at this point , we 're in a new home , and , uh , they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to --"
135655,sw2586,sd,Every once in a while we 'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day .
186011,sw2945,sd,"just the time that they were spending together ,"
101611,sw3526,sd,"and I 've got a , uh , generic three eighty , or four eighty-six machine ."
11756,sw3554,sd,"Well , I do , uh , little aerobics , oh , three or four times a week ,"
12483,sw2594,sd,"They 'll ,"
99782,sw2226,sd,"Ooh , I wish I could do that ."
125641,sw3071,sd,"and I 'm wondering if you , if you have ever done anything like that ,"
82467,sw2131,sd,"But ,"
111854,sw2476,sd,"Now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby ,"
138765,sw2086,sd,"That 's um , I , uh , I 'm , I 'm not that great a cook"
129020,sw3429,sd,"their math is just ,"
184206,sw3073,sd,I 'm not sure I like the new ones too much .
202546,sw4150,sd,I hate to put it quite that way .
138873,sw2086,sd,"I 'm trying to learn how to cook , um , deserts without , without all of the sweets , you know , maybe use honey or something ."
99919,sw3093,sd,"enough , enough to make it ."
51313,sw2576,sd,"-- and if it was up to her , we would n't have one ."
419,sw2278,sd,"It only holds about ,"
149281,sw4936,sd,"Uh , I have a , I 'd guess you 'd call a medium quality Craftsman router"
93230,sw2828,sd,"Well , I 've done about all I can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people ."
135456,sw2661,sd,but we do n't anymore .
208869,sw3508,sd,"Well , we have saved our newspapers for years and years --"
175960,sw3246,sd,and I taught for fourteen years --
98956,sw2137,sd,"There are , uh , some groups that have their children , you know , go away for a year ."
167295,sw2469,sd,"The first project I started out one was a big one ,"
34318,sw2190,sd,"and now that they , the inspection systems are analyzing that , uh ,"
60750,sw2433,sd,"because I was saying to him , I said , I 'm not that heavy ,"
201409,sw3883,sd,"but I 've seen . A lot of things I 'm not used to yet , um ,"
209195,sw2548,sd,"The oth , the two ,"
130716,sw2751,sd,"they , they had a problem with they , uh , took their Camaro in to get it traded and they , they had n't signed any papers"
153612,sw2669,sd,and some are in kilometers .
115569,sw2085,sd,In some places they do n't .
195483,sw4109,sd,we can start off there .
81888,sw2441,sd,"Well , you need X number dollars for the recipients"
98961,sw2137,sd,"And the parents fund them for the whole year , year and a half that they 're gone ."
77863,sw3988,sd,"Oh , I , I 'm very , uh , I 'm very varied as well ."
173191,sw3417,sd,"Oh , I did n't realize that ."
13601,sw2368,sd,"you know , it drops , um ,"
130488,sw3371,sd,"I mean you could n't , you really could n't use it for a room ."
138327,sw2713,sd,"So , I got a good one ."
108534,sw3359,sd,"I 'm not into the , the , do n't do the , the raw , raw fish like that ,"
207799,sw3146,sd,It was beautiful .
188568,sw3917,sd,But I 'm not big on subserving as far as --
12875,sw2776,sd,"And , it 's amazing , that , uh , you know , prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks ."
204202,sw2406,sd,I read the book before
62317,sw2051,sd,"Well , I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , I guess ."
2750,sw2038,sd,"if you look at the region in , in , uh ,"
107013,sw3072,sd,"Then I , I 'd love to go somewhere in Asia ,"
135717,sw2586,sd,"and ,"
101980,sw3245,sd,"when I was , I was pregnant through the summer this time --"
8164,sw2534,sd,"because they , they like to get in and fertilize things too ."
53788,sw2155,sd,"But , um , I like the choices you have now , where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some , basically have a independent life-style , but assisted care ."
50287,sw2917,sd,"I would , that 's ideally the where , where I would like to be ."
32420,sw2884,sd,"My wife apparently is not a ,"
192999,sw3435,sd,That 's my friends .
61887,sw3746,sd,"and the pansies looked terrible , but they came back later ."
7750,sw2232,sd,"So , in a way , in a sense I 'm a pacifist ,"
9469,sw2871,sd,"you , know , I do n't keep up with it ,"
194704,sw3154,sd,"Do you know , I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday , I saw the return to the , uh , the small Coke bottles ."
166644,sw2860,sd,"and , uh , it 's that grandmother figure , not only raising her own children , but raising , um , children from the streets , too , frequently ."
71682,sw2220,sd,"And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been , uh , getting cocaine from his client and then selling it ,"
41452,sw3204,sd,They 're in Missouri
188330,sw2184,sd,Let me move as far away as possible .
169852,sw2868,sd,"Uh , we have enough friends here and there ,"
67054,sw4022,sd,"Well , I 'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go ,"
33937,sw2386,sd,and they transferred it to another one that was really far away .
201224,sw4074,sd,They 're --
65754,sw3768,sd,"but there 's , you know , there 's a lot to see here --"
110692,sw3190,sd,as of you ca n't even ski there anymore .
157303,sw2407,sd,So --
71058,sw4184,sd,After --
42305,sw3751,sd,they do .
121930,sw2181,sd,"I , I , I , I feel that way when movies are like blown up , out of proportion , you know --"
117300,sw2642,sd,"Oh , you get that stuff in the mail all the time ."
72328,sw2840,sd,and basically --
203276,sw3120,sd,"and , uh , I do feel like there are a lot of options ."
42049,sw3716,sd,"so , uh , I am kind of interested in cakes and , uh , muffins and stuff like that ,"

117638,sw2514,sd,but the bats eat the bad spiders
7497,sw3921,sd,"You know , uh , that 's the way my mother taught me to fry them"
138724,sw4940,sd,Cause I have n't been there probably ...

2278,sw2788,sd,"That 's probably what I 'll try and look for whenever I do have my children ,"
54002,sw2155,sd,"And it 's really nice because that keeps them going , too , rather than just sitting around ."
118059,sw2575,sd,"I , my parents wanted me to go straight to college"
143070,sw2405,sd,and I could n't imagine not having that thing on a disk --
212075,sw2107,sd,well in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also .

97513,sw3503,sd,"I guess I could convict him ,"
26259,sw3711,sd,"Finally , we saw a policeman ."
66501,sw2521,sd,but really we did n't have a quarterback .

56208,sw3185,sd,"Well , I have a friend who 's the same way ,"
15946,sw2953,sd,"and it was costing too much at home , than , more at home than I was bringing in ."
50912,sw3014,sd,however the need for that --
48431,sw3734,sd,"and I wo n't know what I 'm doing ,"

146460,sw2965,sd,It was starting to burn some oil .
72785,sw4834,sd,"And the lo , local , local papers MUMBLEx ask them to remove your na- , number from their list"
76322,sw3124,sd,"So , I 'm home with , home with two children ,"

148530,sw4154,sd,"I mean I 'm not , not saying at all that Hussein was n't quite willing to ge- , enter that fight ."
198643,sw2061,sd,"I mean , it 's like , it 's like the people that actually do the work there --"
195958,sw2775,sd,"Well , it 's an older home ."

113123,sw2579,sd,I lived there for ten years .
141056,sw2221,sd,and that 's mostly to decide whether or not the person 's actually going to stand trial .
181383,sw3067,sd,and then that 's the way it 's kept in order .
183611,sw4158,sd,Though --
208014,sw2759,sd,I do n't do drugs anyway .
99375,sw3850,sd,"I like , uh , I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and , uh , HOME IMPROVEMENT ."

91798,sw3148,sd,"some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid it could become , uh , bomb quality ."

136542,sw3000,sd,"You know ,"
81976,sw2441,sd,"That was a lot , that 's probably the most fun I had ."

184846,sw3830,sd,that 's already --

6927,sw3019,sd,I do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor .
25163,sw2889,sd,"I had my parents buy everything ,"
100955,sw3364,sd,I did n't .
177414,sw2062,sd,"And then one of the things that we talked about with her was , you know , the need to save for our son 's education ."
188596,sw3917,sd,If he --
92183,sw2566,sd,There 's a difference .
180786,sw2667,sd,"and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the , uh , aerobics classes there ."
78843,sw4633,sd,"Uh , but I do n't know how my father did it ."
196767,sw4688,sd,"And then anything extra is , you know , more or less split up between all of us ."
125663,sw3071,sd,"and , um , so ,"
79004,sw3450,sd,"it , it started about yesterday , I believe ."
187042,sw4325,sd,and I 'm not a certified teacher .
162155,sw2897,sd,"but you know , to me vacation is , is an issue ,"

186341,sw4153,sd,"But , um , every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and , um , you know , would make me a nervous wreck ,"
80615,sw3756,sd,We have one of those ladders .
87333,sw3130,sd,"and that , that has cut down a lot in what we throw out ."
202824,sw4928,sd,"I think , uh , I 'm young ,"
101106,sw3202,sd,I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama .
119603,sw2797,sd,"I mean they really enjoyed the courses , um ,"
183905,sw4334,sd,I either like the song
120090,sw3090,sd,And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now .
94960,sw2435,sd,and I liked that .
73196,sw3639,sd,"I was driving a Lincoln , a Mark Seven --"
204097,sw2406,sd,"This is supposed to be the , the guy that 's , uh , replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or ,"

203260,sw3120,sd,"Uh , I mean , it is a different feeling ."
64317,sw3525,sd,"Uh , I had a lot more control on it , uh ,"
104811,sw2938,sd,I almost forgot my age .
29807,sw2854,sd,"But , and they , they take care of another child"
58992,sw3121,sd,"So , uh , but the others I 'm too far away to help them out at all ."
145595,sw3699,sd,"you say that , because we do have , we have those architectural codes here --"
174246,sw2304,sd,"and then that 's , that 's to start out with ."
145024,sw2372,sd,-- but the quality is almost laser quality .
132638,sw3587,sd,"but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and , and just going out and seeing what there was to see , uh , in the area ."
100097,sw3182,sd,"and I 'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown Cleveland , something like that ."

64872,sw2782,sd,"we , we 've tried different times ,"
197294,sw3467,sd,and I tape because I 'm not home .

108792,sw2515,sd,"and you go ,"
52041,sw3709,sd,but then I would wear myself out .
168401,sw2826,sd,and it reminded me of that .
112167,sw2519,sd,"I 've never really gotten into it ,"
130678,sw2751,sd,"and he 's never had any problem with it either ,"
202781,sw4928,sd,"But , uh , you know , it 's , it 's just , uh , I 'm busy ."
100383,sw2397,sd,and then I just use whatever colors I want to .
1201,sw4666,sd,"and they , they won that one seven to one ,"
67629,sw2383,sd,"Ha- , they do n't even , a lot of the school systems do n't even , uh , the kids nowadays do n't even know what , what the president 's fitness education program is all about ,"
195565,sw4109,sd,and I 've just been doing that for a few years now
34297,sw2190,sd,an article .
661,sw2741,sd,Because I 'm a teacher
213156,sw3142,sd,"and sometimes it 's , I enjoy it 's , I enjoy going out having a formal meal ."
90692,sw4548,sd,"Like I said , some years ago , I think I would have said there 's no place for capital punishment in the ,"
73212,sw3639,sd,and it 's got a lumbar support in the seats .
47208,sw2830,sd,"And then , uh , I like watching a lot of like college basketball and ,"
203108,sw2429,sd,so he 's going to be
94006,sw2877,sd,I 've never heard anything about it either .
30351,sw3852,sd,"So I 'll probably go back and buy one ,"
148911,sw3338,sd,"Have n't been there ,"
17727,sw3158,sd,"-- and that 's nice and everything ,"
94107,sw2877,sd,"but it 's been so much fun too , uh , talk ."
159519,sw2466,sd,"Uh , THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites ."
131582,sw3003,sd,"it 's the only , uh , minivan they make that 's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it does n't ,"
73758,sw2092,sd,"and I , I knew he needed an alarm clock ."
128674,sw2622,sd,"So , she works with in , in , in sales ."
125019,sw2996,sd,"I used to smoke , you know --"
131812,sw2984,sd,we 're neighbors .
79322,sw3342,sd,"We , uh , saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws ' place last year ."
162784,sw2921,sd,"We , we do n't want to do too much more ."
50039,sw2862,sd,"and , uh , he was just skin and bones , you know ,"
107303,sw3473,sd,"It , it , it 's just an exercise mat that rolls up"
36238,sw2389,sd,"and also like my mom , my mom thinks ,"
2584,sw2289,sd,"Well , we took one load over there ,"
139059,sw3234,sd,"The older kids had wanted one , though ,"
171126,sw2790,sd,"we 're looking at that now ,"
24683,sw2623,sd,"And so , every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that 's how often they change the ,"
116467,sw2287,sd,"or they , I agree with the freedom of the press , you know , and all the amendments ,"
82207,sw2724,sd,Because I lived in Indiana all my life
174289,sw2304,sd,This was around the turn of the century .
183920,sw4334,sd,I do n't really switch around to new things very often .
150772,sw3207,sd,But she goes in the senior citizen center .
142378,sw4050,sd,"And , uh , each one of the , everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for , for like soft drinks"
13920,sw2368,sd,"it 's gone up , you now , maybe like five percent --"
89326,sw4728,sd,"And , uh , it 's real reliable ,"
87857,sw3565,sd,and --
64285,sw3525,sd,"I , well , I 've also found , too , I , I try to work out regularly"
92440,sw2676,sd,"you pick them up , you know ,"
69935,sw3539,sd,That is out for me .
186364,sw4153,sd,"he would , you know , laugh with the kids and play with the kids"
206826,sw4519,sd,"and , uh , the cost of living here in California is , uh , I would say rather pathological ."
128088,sw3556,sd,"-- I will have finished , be finished --"
7477,sw3921,sd,I mean I like to fish for trout
87793,sw3565,sd,so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over .
197632,sw3038,sd,but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was .
38686,sw3496,sd,"We lived in Chattanooga , Tennessee for two years ."
211208,sw3821,sd,"and , and my wife recently , uh , decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off"
78691,sw2053,sd,"and the lady said she could n't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery"
136449,sw3000,sd,"but being from Dallas , um , I think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every we- , month"
32765,sw3016,sd,"And , you know , I do n't , I do n't like , I do n't g , ever get anything over the phone because I do n't want to give my social security number out ."
42309,sw3751,sd,I do .
110322,sw3449,sd,"the three , the three Baltic , uh , republics got out as quickly as they could ."
154723,sw3345,sd,-- I really do .
125909,sw3791,sd,"or we 'll , uh , you know , put it out on the grill so that , uh --"
209526,sw2305,sd,"University of Texas , Dallas ."
24003,sw3769,sd,So I went out a lot with her .
147022,sw3103,sd,"And I can , uh , relate to that , uh ,"
136801,sw3050,sd,I forget which one it was .
101350,sw2073,sd,We live right by the airport .
77826,sw2501,sd,"actually it had been , uh , it would have been , it had been a repaint job ."
151613,sw3398,sd,I do miss that .
4774,sw2711,sd,It 's very interesting .
198658,sw2061,sd,"and they can tell you where your package is anywhere , any time ."
55742,sw2983,sd,"I said , Whoa ."
8313,sw2534,sd,"Hope , hope the stud will find her attractive ."
91314,sw2540,sd,"Most of that 's done with rifles and such . Uh , though there 's , you know , probably I 'm sure some sector that does it with handguns ."
207469,sw3838,sd,"and then I went to school in Utah ,"
28552,sw2924,sd,"I know ,"
135826,sw2586,sd,"it was ,"
119145,sw3898,sd,and then we usually stick by it .
149421,sw3343,sd,"I , at first I thought of food , you know , because that 's what , mainly what I buy ,"
199119,sw2539,sd,"well , I , I was in physical education then"
104394,sw4723,sd,I mean they came in and up and out
19855,sw3001,sd,"But , um , I think they took the dental away now ."
46991,sw2552,sd,"Well , I see that we both share the same belief here that --"
129142,sw3007,sd,"and they bred it for companionship and , uh , uh , disposition and , and ability to hunt ."
10091,sw2716,sd,"we have , we have federal income tax ."
119825,sw2283,sd,"so I 'm not going to , no goi , I 'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there ."
54042,sw2780,sd,"I , uh , I , I guess I 've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues ,"
139785,sw2376,sd,"So we do that with , because we have milk cartons , you know , constantly ,"
10318,sw2768,sd,"And , um , he 's blind"

58103,sw2340,sd,just in case .
26953,sw2821,sd,I do n't know how you feel about that
153220,sw3688,sd,and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that .
20296,sw2478,sd,They told facilities they could not work .
143532,sw3239,sd,"Oh , that 's where I live , too ."
86858,sw3150,sd,But then I thought about it

209916,sw3251,sd,"We came from nine years in a condo , uh ,"

186844,sw4626,sd,I certainly have n't done that in sixteen years or whatever .
27249,sw3271,sd,That experience was awful .
14320,sw2930,sd,"Well , I 'm impressed ."

71433,sw2220,sd,"And the Moody Blues ,"

197292,sw3467,sd,"I have , uh , I have one favorite soap opera ."

191472,sw3445,sd,I like those movies that you watch time and time again .
172973,sw2525,sd,It was amazing
59520,sw3723,sd,"and it felt good ,"
28271,sw2101,sd,And so that 's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved .
9612,sw3903,sd,So we 're riding bicycles
196729,sw3133,sd,I guess that 's about all .
10331,sw2768,sd,But he ca n't say anything .

200773,sw3306,sd,"It was fun ,"

168835,sw2650,sd,They just really do not want other animals on their property .
102596,sw3279,sd,"But I just , I just sometimes feel like I 'm being used ."

125193,sw2019,sd,"She 's only been around one and , and sometimes two people at the most"

105381,sw3355,sd,I like just about any kind except country and western .

168248,sw3068,sd,"I teach at a public school , actually ,"
44045,sw2955,sd,"so in terms of when you were in school , I am sure that it was , you know , the majority of your high school and junior high years ."
82977,sw2703,sd,"But in the summer , I try to read a lot ."
103990,sw3049,sd,"The last two years , I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home ."
194445,sw4349,sd,"and what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand , I have almost one hundred and ten ,"

154414,sw2603,sd,I never would have thought of that .
204367,sw2093,sd,and it 's just that it does n't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that
52100,sw3709,sd,well a while back I was more into basketball --
133355,sw2387,sd,"and I know when my children were younger , um , we found a lot of really nice tapes that they , that they liked ."
107046,sw3072,sd,"and then no one knew English in there ,"
185862,sw2945,sd,"so it 's , it 's , it 's real easy to work out my schedule ,"
92513,sw2676,sd,it 's a fairly new area .
177355,sw2062,sd,"But , uh , you know , I was just , as a matter of fact , I just , uh , celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and , uh , kind of started looking through the , the book because of that , you know ,"

134280,sw3039,sd,and --
92914,sw2598,sd,"I think it 's like six bucks now in the theaters ,"
182472,sw4682,sd,"Uh , they 'll , they 'll actually do things like this ."
45984,sw2662,sd,but --
21773,sw2437,sd,That 's a real worry .

186747,sw4321,sd,"A , uh , fellow when he was much younger , uh , was tried and convicted and sentenced to death ."

188290,sw2184,sd,"like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water , you know , that kind of thing ."
56512,sw2227,sd,"Like , a house burned down in this little town ."

66601,sw2521,sd,So I missed a lot of Sundays during --
51368,sw2610,sd,"I , I have a Suzuki motorcycle"
93872,sw2877,sd,he 's the little boy Pomeranian .
172368,sw2139,sd,"And , uh , or I will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to , uh , to the office ."
174877,sw3320,sd,"Well , it 's got a back up system that does n't work supposedly . Tha- , uh , that if it 's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway . Supposedly ."
36656,sw2457,sd,And get some fresh air in the house
122600,sw4752,sd,"But like , uh , I lived in Oakland , uh , until just recently --"
133708,sw2235,sd,I ought to go looking through some of my old mail .
10077,sw2716,sd,"I , I do n't know maybe other people ,"
1462,sw2325,sd,And so I have n't been able to quit yet .
173289,sw3354,sd,They said that every yard has some --
161171,sw3332,sd,-- and they just pay the minimum required balance .
57977,sw3414,sd,"I happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the , that tub stuff ,"
110868,sw3805,sd,I did not .
83775,sw4698,sd,"I , I see the packages on it , uh , that are available"
158026,sw2241,sd,"Oh , I 've , I 've been trying , uh , uh , a mixture of , uh , the bermuda and the rye ,"
128402,sw3911,sd,and we went camping on vacations .
74199,sw2719,sd,"but once I got used to it , it was habit forming ."
70907,sw4114,sd,"I mean , it , it definitely it 's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver"
6458,sw2308,sd,"and here they are , they 're always used to these old fashioned foods ."
47669,sw3457,sd,and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a MUMBLEx job .
127098,sw2952,sd,I --
68412,sw3333,sd,"and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both ,"
35246,sw2993,sd,"but , or , you know , if you want to have open windows , to be able to op ,"
39749,sw3250,sd,"My children , our children are grown --"
82455,sw2131,sd,If I ca n't understand the words I do n't want to listen to it .
184617,sw4346,sd,"All these kids have these really supportive , really supportive parents , always up there for --"
84927,sw2527,sd,"It 's just amazing ,"
69006,sw3377,sd,"Uh , I guess I 've always kind of liked golf ."
33987,sw2386,sd,"Well , I 'm , um , going to be certified as an English teacher MUMBLEx teach English as a second language ."
65256,sw2533,sd,"then my father got us some tickets ,"
20133,sw2478,sd,"and he said that the banks were calling ,"
40527,sw2954,sd,"I have never seen catfish , you know , except in fi- , filleted on a plate , I think maybe ."
175044,sw2970,sd,"And I mean , that is one big thing down here ."
110165,sw2268,sd,"but , it was when I was a child ."
71664,sw2220,sd,and it was for a murder trial .
36463,sw2457,sd,"and I probably ,"
205549,sw3595,sd,And then make movies out of some of them .
1305,sw2296,sd,but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit .
54731,sw2175,sd,"But , um , now I 've noticed that like , while I 'm at college , and when I go home , my bro- , you know , my ,"
49384,sw3028,sd,"But it 's , uh , it 's just fabulous food ."
45991,sw2662,sd,I like it when they will do something and not get too silly .
181534,sw4092,sd,And I just thought that they done broke up and --
35778,sw2679,sd,-- and we tried it .
84765,sw2113,sd,and that 's all they 'd have to do .
110633,sw2849,sd,"And then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that , ho hum , whatever ,"
139960,sw2376,sd,"And there 's a ton of clothes always , you know left over"
13528,sw2483,sd,"Uh , we probably were listening to C N N fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began ."
8684,sw3405,sd,"and , uh , I would , uh , collect the corn very carefully , ear by ear ,"
86220,sw2479,sd,"We were what ,"
47408,sw2830,sd,"and they , you do n't know if it 's a man or a woman ."
52759,sw2339,sd,I think the longest we 've stayed out there is like five days .
20907,sw3102,sd,"there 's only so much I can do for them ,"
126695,sw3736,sd,You drive up
148222,sw3268,sd,that 's my biggest gripe about living here .
174748,sw2558,sd,"I 'm not so sure what kind of , uh , training that is for the future for those kids ."
13900,sw2368,sd,"-- You do n't run into that up here , I think , I think because there 's so many , uh , professional people , if you want to call them that --"
3858,sw2506,sd,"It 's a two story house ,"
87929,sw2163,sd,"and , and , uh , I 've done pretty good at it ."
141014,sw2178,sd,"and he 's at work ,"
287,sw3530,sd,"my wife talks with other people ,"
70256,sw2792,sd,I ca n't even really remember .
16367,sw3059,sd,I wanted to see that .
69905,sw3539,sd,"You know , there is motivation around there"
139269,sw2630,sd,and Williams is about seven .
158630,sw2608,sd,"Of course now , when you go down there , you know , I mean , they 've got just ,"
42259,sw3751,sd,I do n't try and pay them off .
80906,sw2121,sd,"The , uh , United States and Canada are I guess , is , is , going into , uh , some types of agreements to limit , uh , what 's being given out by power plants ,"
137293,sw3543,sd,"And I guess they got convicted , the four , of --"
139527,sw3087,sd,I really do n't go to very many concerts .
42462,sw3521,sd,"I do n't , I do n't like to , you know , I like to save the editorial information or the , the politically , uh , weighted information , you know , for the , for a different section ."
199221,sw2539,sd,He did n't even tell us .
142452,sw4050,sd,"and then my , my parents live in Greenville ,"
188771,sw4171,sd,but I put all the money into it .
62851,sw2499,sd,"where I lived . Uh , it was a little town called Newmarket ."
133903,sw2999,sd,"I do n't , I do n't want to probably talk to them some more discuss it ,"
173334,sw3354,sd,"and all those variegated , uh , things died ."
128437,sw3911,sd,"I , I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because , you know , he is out working trying to make some money for , you know , we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth , you know ."
197683,sw4831,sd,"and , uh , actually I work for the F B I ."
128526,sw2622,sd,I did n't realize they had no state tax in Texas .
183036,sw4358,sd,"uh , live in an apartment complex ."
190173,sw4166,sd,I was much younger .
45600,sw3770,sd,"In fact , uh , her , uh , uh , experiences were , were invaluable --"
203025,sw2429,sd,not one of my favorite hobbies
90575,sw2366,sd,but probably not .
50278,sw2917,sd,Sales I find are a pain .
111873,sw2476,sd,"Uh , I mean , my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty ."
29324,sw2292,sd,"We , I think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose , um , this area is that , um , my husband was raised in Irving --"
127342,sw2726,sd,"And , uh , so that 's , that 's what we went for first"
148218,sw3268,sd,"At least I always did but although actually , my , I like the mountains ."
175694,sw3288,sd,your car is fuming
21454,sw2929,sd,It took that long .
211218,sw3821,sd,"I mean , she 's paying , I do n't know , I do n't know what per month , you know , forty , fifty dollars per month in interest --"
39103,sw3170,sd,"Even if we have the ,"
69921,sw3539,sd,"like , try to get some place and exercise from five to six ,"
211985,sw2107,sd,"he , he does n't have any front claws ,"
177419,sw2062,sd,"and he 's two now ,"
58336,sw2340,sd,I mean --
5977,sw3265,sd,"Toyota , uh ,"
99965,sw3093,sd,"you know , it 's really a nice stay . Uh ,"
42143,sw3716,sd,I will have to try that .
27722,sw3208,sd,"And with that kind of a system my daughter just is n't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down ,"
111220,sw3368,sd,"Let 's see , I ca n't think of anything else --"
192125,sw2789,sd,And it tells you
98917,sw2275,sd,"everyone else has been a female ,"
93886,sw2877,sd,"we have a cat , Stripper ."
78086,sw2609,sd,"I would n't mind having , oh , more votes than I get to have , frankly ."
87242,sw3130,sd,"Apparently the trucks that they had , um , lined up , they needed the parts for ,"
29147,sw2834,sd,"And , they seem to do fine ."
4726,sw2711,sd,"It was really neat ,"
179776,sw4801,sd,you have these people who are serial killers that did n't even get the death sentence back when --
139799,sw2376,sd,"it 's , uh , I think once or twice a week ."
137785,sw3626,sd,I enjoy it myself .
197860,sw2145,sd,"But I think it 's like , about sixty dollars a week for two children --"
57819,sw3448,sd,"He used to work at , uh , uh , University of Texas at D- ,"
160737,sw2262,sd,and right now in our area we 're fighting against a toxic waste incinerator .
9144,sw2871,sd,that was pretty good .
194583,sw4619,sd,"and there 's , it 's completely generic ."
128422,sw3911,sd,"Uh , I have one neighbor that 's , uh , the father is a fireman"
87423,sw3130,sd,"And they will do the alum- ,"
80157,sw3549,sd,"-- I mean , you know , uh , it has a lot less fat ."
74494,sw2800,sd,and most of the time it is .
185997,sw2945,sd,"and he , uh , he works about an hour and a half away from here , from our home ,"
165239,sw3296,sd,and it 's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that .
42095,sw3716,sd,I have n't .
170580,sw2559,sd,what I 've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report --
89613,sw3728,sd,"We were laughing ,"
25303,sw2495,sd,so we did n't have to do any painting .
100829,sw2832,sd,"And I would go in ,"
3752,sw3813,sd,"and that did get us so that , you know , the house is paid for and , uh , other major things are taken care of"
20983,sw3102,sd,"and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said , what are you going to do"
11182,sw3055,sd,I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie
198520,sw2061,sd,"I found it a lot of times with , regards to education , you know , the school only takes you so far , you know ."
26534,sw3013,sd,"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that ,"
19914,sw3001,sd,"and , you know , he has all that"
211856,sw2107,sd,the other two cats I have are outdoor cats .
108934,sw3194,sd,"And what I found out is , if you look at the bottom of those bags , Kroger or whatever --"
1701,sw2325,sd,"and I just , I think it 's the best thing ."
82873,sw2503,sd,"and the doctor called me up and said , uh , she had a low white cell count and that , uh , she was n't , she was dying and , uh , suggested that I take her to a working hos- , dog hospital , animal hospital ."
65141,sw2533,sd,"Oh , I saw that ."
39341,sw2693,sd,"you know . And that 's , that 's the way I ,"
35456,sw3257,sd,"I keep telling them it 's the same mentality you know ,"
184904,sw4364,sd,You can always refuse
50158,sw2917,sd,"because I mean , you had to pay it in full every month ."
173354,sw3354,sd,And every year we learn one more thing that we did n't know before . Like about these mums .
86719,sw2302,sd,"the guy was caught burgling ,"
174101,sw3040,sd,"I know , uh ,"
23877,sw3769,sd,and then it finally went out of business .
33135,sw3057,sd,"And , uh , he do n't know me usually ."
191003,sw4382,sd,"and , uh , they 're , they 're expanding it to , uh , more counties here . Uh , as the population spreads out"
181009,sw2667,sd,"and of course it 's real convenient , because it is right there at work ."
23986,sw3769,sd,"But , uh , as far as missing living there , no ."
129976,sw2110,sd,"Because , actually , when you , when you do , uh , service overseas you end up learning something , usually that 's , that 's really useful , plumbing , or farming , or , or something like that ,"
21777,sw2437,sd,"and he works , mostly with adolescents ."
78545,sw2053,sd,"Um , I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting , when I do have spare time ."
122800,sw3659,sd,"But normally I collect , oh , like three trash bags full --"
85680,sw2472,sd,"You know , we do n't have that much of it now ."
70851,sw4114,sd,the Third World countries are less industrial
12910,sw2776,sd,well there 's good cholesterol and there 's bad cholesterol .
104788,sw2938,sd,I should know
138092,sw2248,sd,I either want to do it in the fall or spring .
94216,sw2602,sd,"and they , would level entire areas ."
141584,sw2448,sd,"I was ,"
210641,sw3138,sd,"I guess that 's one thing that I particularly like , um ."
198365,sw3962,sd,"Or they will kno ,"
2545,sw2289,sd,"Oh , that 's it ,"
44216,sw3703,sd,"and you do n't have to wait ,"
79296,sw3342,sd,-- but it 's kind of fun .
98429,sw3660,sd,I have n't done this in a couple months .
80618,sw3756,sd,"A friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood , he has done his house"
89192,sw2599,sd,"I 'm sure , you know , my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia ,"
159576,sw2466,sd,And I just realized I had never read it growing up .
113470,sw2969,sd,And --
47601,sw2774,sd,So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
178825,sw3550,sd,"-- and , uh , I bought that used ."
111067,sw3453,sd,"and it 's , it 's a deep trunk , but not as broad as the , uh , the Cadillac ."
45673,sw4615,sd,"But with not a whole lot of discretionary money , it 's kind of hard to figure out how to do it ."
116017,sw2620,sd,We 've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis
212130,sw2107,sd,The whole family was so disappointed .
156281,sw2932,sd,"but they 're spaced out , oh I 'd say maybe three , on a two block period ."
22364,sw2960,sd,"It is before one of the , I think it is before the First Baptist in Sherman airs ."
92007,sw2566,sd,"and , uh , even though it was older , it was , it was real comfortable and ,"
29624,sw2854,sd,"But , but I was out of the country when , uh , my , my son was little ."
186909,sw4325,sd,"I ,"
66698,sw2521,sd,"but then at the ver , in the fourth quarter they 'd let them get up there either with them or , you know , right ahead of them ."
13488,sw2483,sd,"But , I always get a lot of my information from the ,"
137601,sw2585,sd,it 's not step for step .
143402,sw3239,sd,"um , we have one dog , a Bichon Frise ."
144683,sw3082,sd,"-- and again , it 's not , it 's not cheap to rent the lodge up there --"
167005,sw3041,sd,"And they were all MUMBLEx to her at the Vatican city and would n't let her perform in Rome ,"
53082,sw2934,sd,as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house .
109390,sw2313,sd,and my wife was carrying a different one .
12729,sw3815,sd,"And it , basically , it was something that a military guy had ordered and had n't picked up ,"
50497,sw3151,sd,"Oh , that 's probably why ,"
68366,sw3333,sd,and you wonder if he 's going to get shot .
85435,sw2472,sd,"And they , they put this one out"
64890,sw2782,sd,"Well , I found , uh , that , in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned ,"
140617,sw2690,sd,He 's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes .
44725,sw4655,sd,"and I think in the nursing home that I worked for ,"
191696,sw4104,sd,We 're career
147439,sw2490,sd,"and it 's , you know , it 's put up"
196603,sw3133,sd,"Um , but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church --"
57488,sw3855,sd,We got two fifty last year --
38218,sw2692,sd,it 's partially because I can work on them .
122072,sw2181,sd,-- and the good guys can get hit all day long --
12114,sw2827,sd,"uh , when I do though I , I have some friends that I always like to experiment on ."
71725,sw2220,sd,"-- oh , gosh and it 's so hard because , you know , everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done ,"
16528,sw3136,sd,we ca n't either .
35288,sw2993,sd,I shudder .
85836,sw2421,sd,"I do n't know how that 's going to affect , uh ,"
165769,sw2634,sd,"Having ,"
84888,sw2527,sd,It 's very pleasant .
125621,sw3071,sd,"and now I 've , for about the last eight years I 've sung in a church choir here ,"
54822,sw2175,sd,"And , um , we , you know , we had blocks and stuff ,"
44882,sw3965,sd,"I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop , you know --"
63224,sw2545,sd,"I got this cough ,"
129209,sw3007,sd,They will recommend their shepherds as a children 's dog .
90569,sw2366,sd,"in fact , uh , one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin , that is played on , uh , piano ."
105186,sw3372,sd,"you , you probably put down , you know , you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it ."
4985,sw4799,sd,but she 's in a --
148306,sw3268,sd,"You know , there 's mountains"
112493,sw3011,sd,"there are some areas though where , where they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit --"
35331,sw3257,sd,"We do have , uh , cable ,"
31772,sw3293,sd,"and this , you know , s- , frog strangler that we used to call them ,"
10777,sw2090,sd,"I mean when someone comes in ,"
61673,sw2619,sd,"this is a package of dates mind you ,"
145567,sw3699,sd,"And , um , so since the house did burn , they 're , they 're going ,"
23968,sw3769,sd,"but , uh , then I quit work and everything"
75025,sw3155,sd,"so when the computer picked this one , I was a little bit surprised ,"
80151,sw3549,sd,"And after about six hours , you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there ,"
139021,sw3234,sd,I just want to kill her at --
100573,sw2832,sd,"I think it was like ,"
212978,sw2772,sd,"You know , it 's not sandy like most of the state is ,"
136634,sw3431,sd,did it myself .
156393,sw2932,sd,"so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic , time to get into work ,"
17480,sw3042,sd,-- and it was hotter there than it was here .
203644,sw2837,sd,"Dursban ,"
133362,sw2387,sd,"But I still find some of the same tapes , I , uh , some of the same songs from those tapes I enjoy ."
104762,sw2938,sd,"Well I guess that 's fluoro- , the fluorocarbons --"
182789,sw2761,sd,"My family , uh , my parents are the youngest of very large families ."
102641,sw2102,sd,they have a new one now .
132105,sw2185,sd,"Uh , the walls were , uh , uh ,"
156950,sw3052,sd,and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that 's held annually at a big mall here .
108549,sw3359,sd,you get the crabs --
204221,sw2406,sd,All those underwater scenes .
211354,sw2060,sd,"but I do n't , I do n't read newspapers ."
196237,sw4333,sd,"and at the same time , the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases ,"
168708,sw2650,sd,"and , uh , then we got this new cat ,"
76665,sw2365,sd,We wound up selling the house .
27482,sw2723,sd,"Well , course I went through this , uh , what , about five years ago ."
40747,sw3455,sd,we got a baby-sitter
137242,sw3543,sd,"That , that 's , that 's the state that got , was famous when they executed somebody ."
49795,sw3167,sd,and they 're very good --
76385,sw3124,sd,and it was really nice out there .
191112,sw4049,sd,"and then you had a physical , where you were drug tested ,"
88656,sw2336,sd,"And as I said , as far I 'm concerned , it , it has been extremely , uh , uh , serviceable and everything I wanted ."
29950,sw2524,sd,It 's maybe once a year or something
193079,sw3580,sd,That 's all beyond my imagination really .
209649,sw2305,sd,"She 's studying , she 's going into law ,"
122387,sw3384,sd,"but as long as I wa- , w- , you know , was going to work I was going to do as , as much as I could ,"
67290,sw2260,sd,"and , you know , when I left there , we paid six cents on the dollar ,"
92975,sw2598,sd,"but , uh ,"
129105,sw3007,sd,and fortunately it was just like a retriever
158170,sw2022,sd,"so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each , with each paycheck ,"
11043,sw4721,sd,"-- and so , you know , I do --"
6364,sw2308,sd,"So they could n't , they ca n't hide anything on you or anything like that ."
190957,sw4382,sd,and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley .
148392,sw3300,sd,"It was , uh , during Teddy Roosevelt 's time ."
77807,sw2501,sd,"but the , the problem that we 've , we 've owned this house almost five years now ,"
191264,sw3075,sd,"And we 've been down in Texas eighteen years ,"
127863,sw4927,sd,"You know , we only find out about that a year after the fact ."
47789,sw3118,sd,"I do n't know if I feel , I do n't feel real strongly about that ."
43076,sw3009,sd,"because just about six months ago someone came to my front door , rang the doorbell ."
154328,sw2603,sd,"and I , plus I have it , uh , in the living room"
32121,sw2432,sd,That 's a department store .
173491,sw3275,sd,"And you know , we had all the necessities ,"
186690,sw3351,sd,"and he let her out ,"
173419,sw3275,sd,"And then , you know , so I eventually got it all paid ."
102376,sw3232,sd,"I 'm actually from Amarillo , Texas , originally ."
126476,sw3828,sd,"I mean , you know , if it 's just downright , outright ,"
41375,sw3383,sd,"And , uh , either if it 's a drum or , or disc brakes , I enjoy working on those kind of things ."
178591,sw2547,sd,"And so , we , uh , I was just looking ,"
26263,sw3711,sd,we did not know Italian .
186402,sw4617,sd,"Th- , that 's , of course , being facetious"
167790,sw2111,sd,but I wish we could do more .
211084,sw3169,sd,I do n't have anybody to teach me either .
135828,sw2586,sd,"and I guess it was late May ,"
151071,sw3062,sd,"Um , I , I really have been pleased with Plano ."
196547,sw4103,sd,"Uh , well I think , either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point --"
37027,sw3061,sd,"And since they 've moved to where they are , they let the cat out ."
156202,sw4013,sd,"Well , we see that a lot out here in Utah ,"
104224,sw4056,sd,so I 'm pretty satisfied myself .
79000,sw3450,sd,but we 're about two hours from the coast .
95502,sw2785,sd,"you know , rains a little too often ."
66411,sw2521,sd,If they would just quit blowing it .
155913,sw3447,sd,"So , back in my old job , up until through nineteen eighty --"
123910,sw3065,sd,you can buy that
173500,sw3275,sd,I do n't think they like the fact that I have one either .
115352,sw3804,sd,I know .
87676,sw2020,sd,"I saw some promise , you know , with , with a lot of the new wave , when it , when it came out , uh ,"
24633,sw2623,sd,"Uh , my oldest two are already out and about in the world"
117607,sw3773,sd,"Uh , it 's got an office down here in , uh , in , near Duncanville"
594,sw2278,sd,"Have n't taken it yet , though ."
64463,sw4691,sd,there 's no .
113352,sw2969,sd,Got up everything .
42923,sw3810,sd,So that was really fun .
38559,sw3496,sd,I think we would get bored on the boat all the time .
54497,sw2879,sd,and they changed all the facts that they said it was true --
110614,sw2849,sd,"Not speaking in English , um , having the children drive them everywhere , and these were not old people ."
210972,sw4099,sd,"Well , maybe it is n't in Utah ."
8711,sw3405,sd,"But that , that worked out very nicely too ."
110786,sw3190,sd,"We did , um , last year , though , go to San Antonio for Memorial Day --"
8671,sw3405,sd,I 'm allergic to grass .
74539,sw2800,sd,"Uh , so , then a couple years ago I found , uh , a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was , you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership ."
127178,sw2952,sd,"And I got about two , two-thirds of it done ,"
103211,sw2197,sd,"I , I mean I have to ad , confess to that ."
30756,sw2982,sd,"and they , they refuse to give him more salary ."
55181,sw3624,sd,"Well , I , I work the same way ."
31340,sw3203,sd,"Well , the carpenter and painter and , you know , everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built ,"
149640,sw4812,sd,"And , uh , they have a policy for , uh , testing ."
175208,sw2970,sd,I think she is a freshman .
10461,sw3754,sd,I have n't .
146299,sw2965,sd,"so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and , uh , you know , get a replacement part ."
55319,sw4716,sd,"an- , and I do n't know if the kids nowadays are different than what ,"
134611,sw2875,sd,"the engine blew up in it ,"
203429,sw2837,sd,"the thing is , uh , when we moved in they had just , uh , painted , wallpa- , we 're , you know , wallpapered , new carpet and everything"
100647,sw2832,sd,ours is the same
145424,sw2641,sd,"It was ,"
55103,sw3624,sd,So that 's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together .
130653,sw2751,sd,"You know , I presently ,"
29343,sw2292,sd,"-- and it stopped in Dallas for half an hour , so I loaded the kids in the car ,"
8411,sw2528,sd,"and then on the nights I can watch , I 'll pick out something ."
145351,sw2641,sd,"and then she grew to be , you know ,"
160880,sw2262,sd,"They say it has really made a difference , though ."
5744,sw3228,sd,so that kind of bothered him --
12402,sw2594,sd,We have separate bins --
28381,sw4822,sd,"to me , all this , uh , space exploration that we 've done thus far has told us that there 's no other place like earth . That , uh , we ca n't live on Mars ."
3046,sw2125,sd,"noth- , nothing overly strenuous ."
125172,sw2019,sd,"and , uh , if , if the child is , is pretty straight forward , um , she 's fine ."
131021,sw4605,sd,"But , like I say , I , I would n't care because I , I do n't , I do n't even smoke"
109077,sw2893,sd,I did n't want to .
59440,sw3723,sd,"So . Uh , I started anchoring last , uh , anchoring , uh ,"
135085,sw3105,sd,"and that was really , really disturbing ,"
19738,sw2355,sd,I think so .
103191,sw2197,sd,"and I needed basic , really simple education that you can get , pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years ."
148771,sw3338,sd,but it 's mostly oaks
136030,sw3802,sd,But their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen .
156829,sw2678,sd,"Chicago has a lot of good stations , uh ,"
95824,sw3235,sd,-- so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home --
138220,sw2248,sd,and he did n't realize he was touching poison ivy
35163,sw2993,sd,"I have , my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers --"
154524,sw2603,sd,so I went through it .
97086,sw3697,sd,"But , uh , I ca n't do as much as I used to ,"
203183,sw3120,sd,I --
213082,sw2772,sd,and it 's much nicer .
203896,sw2604,sd,"It , it makes me feel like , well , there may be something left for my children , my nieces and nephews and so forth ."
119679,sw2283,sd,"um , the gardens are kind of old ,"
179729,sw4801,sd,I 'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas .
136022,sw3802,sd,"I know , my wife and I were first married here"
89728,sw3081,sd,"then , and I , I usually put the cut up tomatoes next --"
140004,sw2570,sd,"and when I went to college I think everything in my closet , I had made ."
60106,sw2418,sd,I 'm trying to study for that now .
187706,sw3135,sd,"I was just listening to a program this morning ,"
210964,sw4099,sd,"But it 's like , Oh , Heavenly ."
151519,sw3047,sd,and it was quite a production .
104387,sw4723,sd,. I did --
151255,sw3062,sd,"the , in fact , they 've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten , which means they probably wo n't get into the top elementary and , and high school ,"
34436,sw3463,sd,"some friends would take care of the kids ,"
198446,sw2061,sd,"A , a Masters in , uh , information systems ."
94918,sw2435,sd,And I do .
186372,sw4153,sd,so they had a really nice balance .
51273,sw2576,sd,"but , I know , oh , well , I guess , they have their crowds , like during the soap operas , you know , like in between classes or something --"
31931,sw2205,sd,"and so we 're still shopping ,"
46018,sw3460,sd,"like I was in Michael 's the other night and charged something ,"
203687,sw2837,sd,it was so much fun .
142961,sw2405,sd,"I have often thought that , that having one at home would be neat ."
153990,sw2154,sd,"but I do n't anymore , maybe once or twice a year ."
131674,sw3535,sd,"I know where you , I know the area ."
201965,sw2477,sd,"You never see them on a , on nationally basketball ."
199046,sw2539,sd,"All my friends , they , their parents worked all the time ,"
85183,sw3069,sd,"and he really , this man really shed some light on , um , some ,"
178390,sw3259,sd,Taco Bell .
40586,sw3847,sd,"we 've been doing it ourselves for most of the time , uh , find that it 's really a little more economical ,"
212554,sw4868,sd,Because there was one that it was really handy to have .
177843,sw4608,sd,"There was a , there was a case about two years ago --"
169013,sw2316,sd,"even a bad school is a good school up here , where , if I lived in New York City or Washington , D C , uh , I would seriously consider moving if I had a child ."
192498,sw4168,sd,"I mean , not all the time ."
207649,sw3146,sd,I think they 're wonderful .
39944,sw2511,sd,"And I have the same problem ,"
17080,sw3319,sd,"and you 're doing a whole lot better , you know ,"
39573,sw2935,sd,"and I say , Jeez , you know , this is the first year it 's been so perfect ."
101143,sw3202,sd,and my family is from Ohio
108981,sw2893,sd,it was n't really health related .
117481,sw3773,sd,"-- and so , uh , we really want four or five bedroom house"
171785,sw3237,sd,They 're my babies .
32197,sw2432,sd,"Well , that 's all I really know about recycling ."
146527,sw3825,sd,"Oh , well , that 's my husband 's side and my mom , my mom 's , or my family , uh ,"
45270,sw2578,sd,"That 's it ,"
107328,sw3381,sd,"In our state right now , uh , recently they 've had a lot of , uh , uh , the rapists , uh , murder type , uh , killers going around"
60832,sw2433,sd,"I could n't , you know --"
159982,sw2427,sd,you do a lot more area than I do .
159212,sw2526,sd,"and I 'm like , um , but , uh , I have n't seen one yet either"
40035,sw2511,sd,"and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all ,"
1280,sw4666,sd,That was the Super Bowl .
47555,sw2774,sd,"And , uh , so I was n't directly involved"
167003,sw3041,sd,"they talked about her ,"
57757,sw3448,sd,"he 's , he 's black"
39074,sw3170,sd,"But , we do it mainly for , you know , the cash flow ,"
48022,sw2744,sd,"I talked to , a guy the other day"
170186,sw3655,sd,"But I kind of , I liked it some ways"
187345,sw4152,sd,"I have n't talked to , uh , I have n't talked to a whole lot of black people on it"
86186,sw2479,sd,"but it was all , uh , really expensive ."
73223,sw3750,sd,"I , uh --"
24679,sw2623,sd,I 'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings .
65178,sw2533,sd,"but I do n't even know if they 're still New York Yankees ,"
25714,sw2898,sd,"you 're going to have to ,"
201397,sw3883,sd,"I know that some of the schools they have , uh , country western day or something like that one , you know , or tacky day ,"
213818,sw3134,sd,"So they started , uh , dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees --"
111008,sw3453,sd,I travel on the road
82108,sw2724,sd,"But , uh , I guess the bicycling is the one thing I 'll sort of , like , do if I feel like I need to go exercise ."
103090,sw2197,sd,I do n't know how many people actually pay the whole shot .
53324,sw3046,sd,you know they been advertising that
95934,sw4026,sd,"the only other things that I 've ever had trouble with , uh ,"
58714,sw3310,sd,"And if I 'd pop in unexpectedly , I discovered , you know , they did a little bit , they did better ."
163260,sw2842,sd,They 're all grown up
10692,sw2090,sd,I probably wo n't make anything beyond this blanket .
140194,sw2570,sd,"Well , I , I figure it takes practice"
174584,sw2910,sd,I did n't know that .
61086,sw2423,sd,And it 's all got to line up .
151072,sw3062,sd,"I have a child who , uh ,"
42263,sw3751,sd,"So I have got myself ,"
5273,sw3439,sd,and I just kind of tell my kids how much I hate paying interest
129482,sw2926,sd,"However , I 'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago ,"
163546,sw2909,sd,"As long , it 's like well ,"
72642,sw3691,sd,"It 'd be like , it 'd been like deactivated as far as --"
185628,sw4362,sd,and they only work nine months a year
201068,sw4890,sd,"And I 'm just trying to determine , you know , how you address , how you weigh , you know , Rodney getting , getting the hell beat out of him against , you know , forty deaths ."
116974,sw3096,sd,"and , uh , so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that 's"
211509,sw3252,sd,-- it sort of has a bob tail .
17817,sw3908,sd,"I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com- , or my wife and my daughter going into combat --"
12669,sw3815,sd,"And electric windows , and power locks ."
64424,sw4691,sd,so I 'm trying .
132555,sw2663,sd,"of course , we 're not talking about politics ,"
31017,sw2754,sd,"Uh , I 'm not sure about Pennsylvania , whether we have it or not ."
91500,sw2285,sd,and then there 's a very large Hispanic population there .
145125,sw2641,sd,"I , I favor dogs over cats actually"
105740,sw2616,sd,The war that just went on .
154096,sw2154,sd,"It ,"
148811,sw3338,sd,"and this is his first year ,"
157809,sw2442,sd,"So I 've calmed down everything except , I was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the , um , walking ,"
51434,sw2610,sd,"We , we do , uh , um , well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill co- , bond wire on --"
12769,sw3815,sd,"it , it 's really more fun than anything"
140763,sw2178,sd,I thought it was okay .
65798,sw3768,sd,"So I was doing linguistic work actually , travelling around , finding out about languages , and --"
100354,sw2397,sd,"and I tell you , really , I could just kick myself for even starting it , because I have a feeling I 'm never going to get it done ."
48281,sw3735,sd,-- I really do .
81179,sw2229,sd,I watched that cause he was cute .
122533,sw3384,sd,"and I would love ,"
33124,sw3057,sd,"but she made arrangements , so that when she was gone ,"
157680,sw3021,sd,"and ,"
93972,sw2877,sd,"and he said , um , let 's give her some race horse shots ."
66085,sw2913,sd,The part where they 're shooting mercy .
98209,sw2008,sd,"Um , you know , there 's real no , no real dress code where I work ."
171939,sw3325,sd,"I thought , oh , boy , do I have a pet ."
194212,sw4379,sd,And --
67729,sw3458,sd,"You know , if I want something intellectual , I usually read a book ."
60570,sw2433,sd,I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there .
129980,sw2110,sd,All the ones that are already retired .
60902,sw2423,sd,"well , we usually start them right in the house ."
1177,sw4666,sd,"I have n't followed it real closely at all . Uh , except like I said , last year when the World Series rolled around , I did , I did follow that pretty religiously ."
4527,sw2168,sd,"But just think of all the , the , all the lawyers you 've kept employed ,"
136926,sw3050,sd,"And then we had a P G A , actually , a very big P G A , uh , tour stop here , last year ."
208877,sw3508,sd,like it 's about a fifth of what it used to be --
210873,sw4099,sd,We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop
38186,sw2692,sd,So I 'm just doing it all myself .
183454,sw4048,sd,"But I know , they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance ,"
76153,sw2334,sd,and that was the place to go to get your T V -s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that .
104288,sw4056,sd,So it 's kind of like drawing this line
1955,sw2788,sd,"you do have to pay , you know , if you ,"
188506,sw3917,sd,"Uh , I have a boyfriend"
18546,sw4814,sd,"you have to go the House , the Congress , and all of the o- , other things --"
36869,sw3061,sd,"I mean , um , that made me think of , uh , when our daughter was looking at colleges , we visited a campus in , um , Saint Louis"
194231,sw4379,sd,We have a household budget .
201710,sw4004,sd,"and , you know , MUMBLEx presidents have always avoided that --"
127453,sw2726,sd,so .
175552,sw2331,sd,"and it will start then ,"
112117,sw2989,sd,"and when I signed up for it , it , uh , looked like it could be , make a real contribution in participating ."
157693,sw3021,sd,"You know , I do n't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away ,"
170438,sw4347,sd,and I belong to the user 's group
138891,sw2086,sd,"you did n't notice it at first ,"
44311,sw3703,sd,"Like around , I think it 's a little past or it 's right before Midway , or it 's --"
22056,sw2960,sd,they do .
124905,sw2996,sd,"I mean , you know , they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they 're going to , uh , enact this I think , uh , the , um , other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling"
129877,sw2736,sd,"Uh , I 'm not really sure if I would want the seat belts attached to the door ."
154351,sw2603,sd,And I love it .
160734,sw2262,sd,"Uh , we 're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh ,"
42990,sw3009,sd,"I do n't ,"
17760,sw3908,sd,"Uh , responsibilities is what I am trying to say ."
169901,sw2868,sd,"I we , we read Bruce MUMBLEx book before we went , you know ,"
67618,sw2383,sd,"hope , hopefully the new , uh , education , secretary of education will do something to fix the problem"
143483,sw3239,sd,she --
128823,sw4759,sd,Swimming one day .
191520,sw3445,sd,I have n't seen that one .
131070,sw3018,sd,-- we like to watch that .
107094,sw3386,sd,"Uh , I guess I look at , uh , getting the best deal ."
2593,sw2289,sd,"But , um , I produce quite a bit of trash ,"
152487,sw3524,sd,Very little .
8688,sw3405,sd,"So we had a nice thing going there ,"
197664,sw4831,sd,that 's really great .
213439,sw4175,sd,-- probably MUMBLEx at all .
14442,sw2888,sd,"they cover the headlines ,"
127976,sw3556,sd,"and , you know --"
194970,sw4646,sd,So that was their thinking .
196688,sw3133,sd,"and , uh , sometimes what Richardson and Plano both ,"
60070,sw2418,sd,"Uh , of course , you have to have some sort of record in high school , uh , of , of achievement and everything ,"

189633,sw4830,sd,"When you 're saying as far as the appeal , uh , procedure was concerned ."
214409,sw2611,sd,"and then in the winter time it 's jeans or , or pants ."
44603,sw2950,sd,she is more wrinkled .
5025,sw4799,sd,"and , and then , and yet they have their , their friendships and relationships and the , you know , of getting together and eating together and all of that ."
101834,sw3254,sd,"Uh , we 'll go get pizza and , uh , at Little Caesar 's , although the kids prefer Domino 's ."
149703,sw4812,sd,They probably give you a chance to explain yourself --
195878,sw3144,sd,"I said okay fine , I , I will , I will ."
136579,sw3000,sd,"And , uh , people go there to be abused ."
6176,sw2684,sd,"and she interviews ,"
196172,sw2775,sd,And that was even just with two people .
203040,sw2429,sd,I do n't know what she calls them in
92003,sw2566,sd,"and , um , it had been recommended by some friends of ours"

10582,sw3754,sd,"Oh , I have n't been there either ."
204846,sw3171,sd,and we said let 's go to New Orleans .
189500,sw2395,sd,"and the people would be standing there in gas masks ,"
47495,sw2830,sd,"and , you know , other then that I 'm sure they watched ,"
201158,sw4074,sd,and you know they are --

138778,sw2086,sd,"and it , and it fits right on your , uh , st- , it fits right on your burner , whether it 's gas or electric"
22034,sw3255,sd,and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I 'm sure he breathed it --
67941,sw3628,sd,"It 's by , um , Boise ."
77613,sw4733,sd,and --
1972,sw2788,sd,I work in the news business
119793,sw2283,sd,"I got to shovel it all , lots of fun ."
48782,sw2149,sd,"And it 's not , you know , we do n't promote it a lot outside the community because we do n't want recognition for it , you know --"
183656,sw4380,sd,And --

147949,sw3636,sd,"Just , just the drive up through , uh , up the coast line --"
191355,sw3075,sd,"I think when we went to England and France , we were there ten , twelve days ,"

97692,sw2648,sd,"Uh , only thing I can think is bleaching"
194593,sw4619,sd,"I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who , uh , were adequately deficient in their abilities , uh --"
92109,sw2566,sd,And that 's why I do n't mind paying more .
97235,sw2743,sd,and then after one year it started heating only on one side .
105034,sw2938,sd,I did cut down a lot .
91608,sw2285,sd,I do n't know how you combat that .
44505,sw2950,sd,It had a different feel to it .
42913,sw3810,sd,He 's a delayed child .
191465,sw3445,sd,"I , I live with , um , a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us ."
135485,sw2661,sd,It 's thirty miles .

37339,sw2562,sd,That helps a whole bunch .
39817,sw3250,sd,"-- now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to ,"
127322,sw2726,sd,"and it had a built in , uh , grill"
175453,sw2331,sd,"well , have , have probably like , like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding ."
104373,sw4723,sd,but I ca n't even do that because of the alarm .
131454,sw3003,sd,"and I 'll know the answer today ,"
84582,sw3223,sd,"-- uh , I , I like things that , uh , are , are wholesome , I guess ."

75509,sw2870,sd,"Well , not in my family ."
184197,sw3073,sd,"So we do n't watch , uh , that type of show ,"
3145,sw2125,sd,"so , that 's a possibility ."
213012,sw2772,sd,And it pretty much is in the middle of Summer .
115472,sw2085,sd,I 'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime .
26591,sw2064,sd,"And we 've , you know , done away with our , quote , fair share number ."

94051,sw2877,sd,"He 'll either bark for food , or he 'll bark to go out"
204805,sw3171,sd,And this time we 're going to be going with just one daughter
129973,sw2110,sd,"America 's paying all this money to have other people give , uh , aid to other countries ,"

14381,sw2888,sd,I like K R L D .
27360,sw2723,sd,"I , uh , I only started doing it after , uh , I started getting calls and said , oh , heck ,"
159504,sw2466,sd,I do n't read as much as I would like to either .
61062,sw2423,sd,and then they go off and do other things during the summer .
50162,sw2917,sd,"so I sent back all of mine , except the ones that were free ."
115577,sw2085,sd,"You know , I went to college late on in life"
88828,sw3159,sd,"And I get into , uh , newspapers ,"

188322,sw2184,sd,and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living .

191847,sw4327,sd,he still charges you that hundred dollars .
203925,sw2604,sd,But that 's why they 're there and not me .
45240,sw2578,sd,"But purely just for enjoyment ,"
65045,sw3406,sd,"it 's , it 's a plate that fits in , you know , into the smoke pipe --"
54678,sw2879,sd,"but amazingly it 's like , uh , Massachusetts went back ,"
89265,sw4728,sd,"and , uh --"

204342,sw2093,sd,we 've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going .
85922,sw2421,sd,and so I have a little more contact with that .
195,sw3530,sd,"and , uh , I 'm just finishing another one up on , uh , statistical sampling ,"
180797,sw2667,sd,"And I had a friend of mine going ,"
184758,sw3830,sd,but we have --

145243,sw2641,sd,"and , you know , they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that ."
80813,sw2121,sd,"I mean the stuff I 've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit , uh , overstated . That a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all ."
151159,sw3062,sd,she had already picked it up .
105122,sw3372,sd,"Well , see we have the testing already here ."
185140,sw3506,sd,"Usually when we have a dinner party , I always , I like to grill ."
74825,sw2445,sd,"they 're , they 're , uh , it 's like a little house except the whole face is open ,"
133463,sw2755,sd,"She 's , she 's not even a year yet ,"
179255,sw2568,sd,and it 's got a good historical perspective to it .

38720,sw2968,sd,"I am not into soap , soaps and all that stuff ."
62740,sw2499,sd,I 'm so sick and tired of that .

87713,sw2020,sd,"you know , world music takes the forms that have really been , um ,"
88306,sw4859,sd,I use to work at Anteks .
191650,sw4104,sd,"and then I do n't , usually do n't exceed that unless I , unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if I have car expenses"
157416,sw2407,sd,"And I thought , well now , here you have a student who is trying to pass , who is struggling with your subject"
78818,sw4633,sd,and my little one also competed because really she had no choice .
54726,sw2175,sd,and we have n't discussed this at all . Um .
163528,sw2909,sd,"Some of them , some of them moved back and forth ,"
210372,sw3304,sd,"They just get around and , and talk techy or , or else , uh , uh , you know ,"

163939,sw2691,sd,"Cape Cod style , I guess you 'd --"
108321,sw3225,sd,"It 's just my husband and I , too --"

48776,sw2149,sd,"They , uh , luckily we have a , a man who owns a building company ."
42507,sw3521,sd,"But , I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL ."
46194,sw3104,sd,"and she soon realized , you know ,"
24570,sw3231,sd,"we saw it at the movies ,"
34906,sw2373,sd,"look at your map later and see the , the town of Amarillo --"
11073,sw4721,sd,"and so getting out and being active , uh , is , uh , uh , helps out ."
112129,sw2989,sd,"and , uh --"
782,sw3426,sd,"Well there are some kind of nice prizes ,"
101476,sw2710,sd,"And , uh , a whole bunch of peop- ,"
60642,sw2433,sd,I broke my heel .
84893,sw2527,sd,"I mean , you got to , you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what 's going to happen ."
119976,sw3926,sd,They were following him home from the motorcycle shop .
88532,sw2039,sd,they are gathering a data base for voice processing .
190545,sw4148,sd,"But I do n't know whether you need an , a unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty to acquit ."
54371,sw2879,sd,"I 'm in Rome , New York ."
12232,sw2827,sd,"he , he , do- , does that a lot ,"
57008,sw2237,sd,"because the , uh , we had a couple of good , real good wind storms ,"
13939,sw2368,sd,"but , um , it was an older home ,"
139968,sw2376,sd,"And they distribute them to the people ,"
27345,sw3271,sd,"And , and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier . You know ,"
100073,sw3182,sd,"Well , see , I do n't ,"
208400,sw2290,sd,"So I got my chicken MUMBLEx and all my little net and everything ,"
17857,sw3282,sd,I 'm just a little bit too .
77111,sw2734,sd,"well , I 'd , I , now I have a problem with this , too ."
52001,sw3709,sd,and I do n't work out on Saturday or Sunday --
120735,sw4675,sd,"So , which I 've been doing ."
183498,sw4048,sd,I 'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask .
6665,sw3803,sd,"or , I do n't know whether this could be something that was done in school ,"
20064,sw3054,sd,"Um , our children are both grown"
178621,sw2547,sd,"but that same house here , you 'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year ,"
70665,sw2460,sd,"Uh , out that way ,"
105492,sw3355,sd,"Of course that 's what I played ,"
129577,sw2926,sd,"Well , I never thought of that benefit , yeah ."
31958,sw2205,sd,"and , uh , I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you 're , you 're more likely to get ,"
37844,sw3184,sd,"Well , our ho- , --"
123149,sw3402,sd,"whatever I 'm doing , I watch that ."
164794,sw4008,sd,you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort .
140032,sw2570,sd,I 'm not .
144110,sw2249,sd,"and I 'm , and in full , uh , support of all of them ."
167824,sw2111,sd,"and that 's really helped a lot ,"
27082,sw2821,sd,"cause with two we have a problem ,"
83333,sw2703,sd,"There was , uh , I understand there was a really good basketball b- , book called , uh , A SEASON ON THE BRINK ."
143253,sw3491,sd,Somewhere in that range .
94016,sw2877,sd,"Um , um , well we 're living now in an area where we , we , we 're in the woods"
91990,sw2566,sd,"so she stayed with her about , roughly two years ,"
32878,sw3057,sd,"and her mother ,"
139228,sw2630,sd,but we 've been there when MUMBLEx whose gone up there .
125116,sw2019,sd,"So , on next night , I spread the newspaper in the bathroom"
195194,sw4378,sd,We 've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them .
25396,sw2495,sd,"but , you know , we worked something out , because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long ."
14984,sw2709,sd,"But I , I 've , I 've become very cynical --"
135565,sw2586,sd,"So what you do is , you strip off , oh , four , five , six little rolls , coils , of line into your hand ."
14279,sw2930,sd,I 'm afraid to get him out .
107773,sw2992,sd,"And so , I know they did n't pick up these curse words from me ."
110015,sw2268,sd,"so I can go out and go , uh , deep sea fishing ."
213324,sw3142,sd,And that 's supposed to be wonderful .
207079,sw3349,sd,"and that dropped off about the time I hit puberty , I guess ,"
209220,sw2548,sd,I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for .
86268,sw2479,sd,"I 've heard that ,"
126653,sw3464,sd,"and , and so , uh , you know , so it 's , you can always count on her to watch something like that ."
43921,sw2995,sd,"Because we offer it in a very low , you know , quantity ."
100445,sw2264,sd,"And then , all the sudden , it disappeared , you know ."
200826,sw3441,sd,I MUMBLEx gave out my work number --
25158,sw2889,sd,"So , I 've done that once"
50953,sw3014,sd,getting out of that was a used car .
21782,sw2437,sd,"But most of the time it 's they get into the wrong crowd first ,"
167817,sw2111,sd,"Now everything else like the tra- , uh , paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers"
2504,sw2289,sd,"I did n't think that ,"
109294,sw3399,sd,"and , you know , he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that ."
158685,sw3517,sd,but now I go back there
104539,sw3373,sd,"I watch just about anything ,"
209646,sw2305,sd,-- and it does n't become fun anymore .
1320,sw2296,sd,"For me , it 's much easier just the stationary bike ,"
85389,sw3367,sd,"and of course uh , of battery or assault or , that is not a capital crime see ."
177130,sw4886,sd,"And , uh --"
5093,sw3233,sd,-- and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp --
81627,sw2434,sd,"He could , he could of hit something else ."
147463,sw2490,sd,it was one thing
131863,sw2984,sd,and it 's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over --
100850,sw2832,sd,So she woke up with about six feet of water in her house .
28754,sw2924,sd,"and what they were pleading was , um , they were pleading insanity ."
8354,sw2528,sd,"Oh , I have n't watched that very much ,"
69198,sw2617,sd,"And I realize they 're still saying , well here you 're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein ,"
53801,sw2155,sd,"but they 're seventy-five and , and seventy-two ."
101404,sw2710,sd,"And it seems like every time I 'm short of cash , I just go get , get it from Visa ."
19668,sw2355,sd,"and ,"
206778,sw3161,sd,"You know the , the other thought that I had , uh ,"
199553,sw2628,sd,And they ca n't imagine why we would want to have children .
78012,sw3988,sd,"And he , he is real fun to listen to ."
120967,sw2187,sd,I just happen to plan one out for Saturday
140333,sw4821,sd,"I , I , I pretty much am"
200203,sw2729,sd,"and , uh , an part of the , the movie is where he 's trying to clean this dog up"
126170,sw3191,sd,"Though she 's not , uh , she does n't have to receive constant medical attention , she , because of arthritis , she 's just unable to get out of bed ."
111496,sw3097,sd,and I am looking forward to that too .
207228,sw3796,sd,"and , uh , I think the Bulls won by two ."
200206,sw2729,sd,"my my dog , last German Shepherd , it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too ."
44622,sw2950,sd,And you lose a lot of that .
32091,sw2432,sd,"So , a little different ."
154347,sw2603,sd,"And I have n't figured how to get that soft ,"
21015,sw3102,sd,"Well m- , my wife , was sort of in the same situation ,"
56295,sw3185,sd,Well I like seventies --
184567,sw4346,sd,"I have friends that live in the other , the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town"
34296,sw2190,sd,"I did n't see ,"
163358,sw2909,sd,My wife when she talked about the Middle East
34674,sw2293,sd,"I mean they fine the industries ,"
39636,sw2935,sd,"but again , it 's just like the sun scorch ."
94550,sw2485,sd,"He does ,"
115492,sw2085,sd,"And then we got that cafeteria plan ,"
175204,sw2970,sd,"and on the cover of TIME magazine , there is a girl , she is in Boston ?"
112882,sw2579,sd,and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon
145987,sw2253,sd,"And I keep telling my husband that ,"
180507,sw3311,sd,My sister lives in Plano .
136665,sw3431,sd,"and that 's , uh , what we put back on there , was a latex paint ."
128279,sw2122,sd,"Uh , I graduated in eighty-six ."
138185,sw2248,sd,"And they 're , you know , they 're in like MUMBLEx and scouts and stuff like that , you know ,"

129708,sw2736,sd,"Uh , I 've got three children at home . Two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old ,"

11455,sw3760,sd,"Sometimes , when everybody 's gone to bed , my kids are in bed and my husband in bed ,"
612,sw2278,sd,it 's getting nice .

27833,sw2557,sd,I do n't know all of them
100712,sw2832,sd,And he rewired the house

205695,sw3781,sd,"I , I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to ."
24982,sw3162,sd,and I do n't know whether it 's by state or whether there 's been some --
127688,sw2180,sd,"by the same token we had , um , uh , some people who wanted t- , had vacations planned"
60803,sw2433,sd,"I live in Richardson ,"

165531,sw2717,sd,"and , and so they were so upset from robbing this guy , you know , trying to do this holdup that did n't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started , you know , shooting people ."
161180,sw3332,sd,"and say , well , I 'm going to buy this when it 's good and on sale"
199796,sw2399,sd,"Plus it , uh , has , you know , from an economic point of view it has increased our debt --"
22544,sw2353,sd,I was working on a masters degree
49034,sw2446,sd,"but I mean , it , I think it 's just kind of the North American situation MUMBLEx ."
125278,sw2631,sd,So I do n't have any children .
95475,sw2785,sd,And they devastate the trees
172703,sw3409,sd,and I --

65048,sw3406,sd,"The more smoke is produced , you know ,"
22693,sw2353,sd,"I think that 's , uh , just having a good time ."
36615,sw2457,sd,"Well , I 've been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up ,"
109571,sw2313,sd,"so now I have to carry cash when I go to the grocery store , which is new to me , you know ,"
203746,sw2604,sd,"Uh , and I find ways to , to turn some of that back to , to others ."
99991,sw3093,sd,"Well , we are ,"
178649,sw2547,sd,"Uh , and because the cost of living around here is so high ,"
154843,sw2584,sd,"And , uh , that makes it a lot more enjoyable ."
131815,sw2984,sd,"And , uh , but grew up in , uh , Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden --"
187531,sw3315,sd,"Well , today on C N N they were talking about something like this about , uh , learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that 's going on which is kind of what we 're doing , helping them get a data base for words ."
164571,sw2266,sd,"we watch a lot of movies that we 've got on V C , on tapes ,"
177979,sw2658,sd,"and ,"
142268,sw3020,sd,"I do n't really remember , for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare"
109803,sw2300,sd,this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee .
51510,sw2610,sd,They 're not going to change that to meters .
102973,sw4660,sd,"And then , uh , my morning paper . I can hardly wait for it to come ."
191405,sw3075,sd,"I like ,"
206401,sw3152,sd,and --
138309,sw2713,sd,"We , we pull mostly evenings ."
140255,sw2570,sd,"and it 's the loopers that form the , the edge , you know that edge finish ."
7903,sw2232,sd,"I I MUMBLEx woman always says , my husband always goes three that , I guess ."
209943,sw3251,sd,"-- and , uh , took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing ,"
98597,sw3088,sd,"but out on the line , they 've got people working some --"
61429,sw2279,sd,"Well , my dad , all he , all he wanted to do was get money for us ,"
118311,sw3056,sd,"and she had , before it actually got big , she sent me this book saying , you might like this ,"
163414,sw2909,sd,"I do n't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they 're citizens ,"
201001,sw4342,sd,"and , of course , they tend to cover the county ,"
190890,sw4036,sd,"Yeah , I mean , I , I really , I would like to , uh , to do at some point , um ,"
87752,sw2020,sd,"I , I listened"
2668,sw2289,sd,"But here , Let me put that in a paper cup for you ."
129236,sw4905,sd,"So I 've seen a wide range of both , you know , nonsalary type benefits and other stuff , you know , like health care that 's either fully or partially paid"
8864,sw2354,sd,"he 's probably about forty years old now ,"
109705,sw2300,sd,"They take out for the , for the finances --"
68561,sw3497,sd,"Uh , I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven ."
66651,sw2521,sd,Ice and rain and everything .
100861,sw2832,sd,"we have , um ,"
196033,sw2775,sd,This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five .
166208,sw2784,sd,"I , I should imagine that , that would be to keep it at a level , those levels , I guess , that , that were originally appropriated w , was when the Soviet threat , I guess , was perceived as being a greater one ."
171849,sw3237,sd,"-- but , when we first moved to Coppell , it 's what , six years ago , we did n't even have a grocery store --"
172127,sw2330,sd,"now , the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny ."
38235,sw2692,sd,"I won , always wonder when you have little things like that happen , why , even here at T I , why we do n't inspect , I 'm in facilities , why we do n't inspect areas and , and guarantee it so to speak . Uh ,"
45655,sw3770,sd,"But , anyway . Well , I 'm ,"
155894,sw3447,sd,And that 's pretty much the norm for me .
12476,sw2594,sd,"You know . So ,"
149473,sw2067,sd,"I , I , uh , I just do n't like them ."
142875,sw3515,sd,"But , uh , I know we had a problem down here with , uh , oil , people taking oil out of their cars --"
211682,sw3925,sd,"and I , uh , I , I have not found one yet that I would rather live in ."
19847,sw3001,sd,You only have to take three days of vacation
23790,sw3214,sd,"Back when I decorated the house with a lot of the little country , uh , primitive things , the little , the little pigs and the jeez , and the --"
31492,sw3527,sd,"And they would , uh , they also edged ,"
158785,sw3517,sd,"So we just , you know , we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that ."
185876,sw2945,sd,"she worked part-time when my oldest was , was little"
77843,sw2501,sd,"because you almost have to strip the whole thing ,"
198254,sw3083,sd,"that 's why I say , it 's , it 's a tough question what would you do ,"
20063,sw3054,sd,We are talking about starting camping again in the fall .
128586,sw2622,sd,"I do n't , I do n't ,"
23298,sw2959,sd,"They were lost , you know , when they were little ,"
15668,sw2953,sd,"I was ,"
43540,sw2263,sd,"Well , we used to ,"
144190,sw2249,sd,"because , you know , I 've talked to many people"
204088,sw2406,sd,"He was , he 's of course , uh , I guess he 's trained in this , uh , martial arts of some sort ,"
205771,sw3781,sd,"and then I went and looked and , to see what my visa was"
6582,sw3189,sd,"and so they just have a , you know , a day picnic ,"
9133,sw2871,sd,"and , uh , it was called the DELLS ,"
160264,sw2427,sd,"And , uh , I had sandy loam hauled in ."
185366,sw4108,sd,"But , uh , to the best of my ability , I 'd like to do it until it gets impossible ."
145439,sw2641,sd,"do you have , you said you had two cats ,"
111204,sw3368,sd,"But I stopped doing that a long time ago ,"
88901,sw3159,sd,"I think they all that- , thought , well , we have a live one . She 'll subscribe ."
87185,sw3200,sd,"And I never worried about saving money because we just , we 're in the savings plan at work"
188619,sw3917,sd,there 's nobody again .
120208,sw3090,sd,"And I ,"
202773,sw4928,sd,"And , uh , you know , I , I know that in , MUMBLEx I just know that I 'm going to get blown away with some , some piece of nonsense ."
129856,sw2736,sd,but they do have one in Texas .
76537,sw2365,sd,"It was something like that , although , we sort of , when we got through I wished we had n't done it"
34887,sw2373,sd,"uh , right here in Colorado Springs where I live --"
140543,sw2690,sd,And so --
206755,sw3161,sd,"I , I guess there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to . Uh , be it through different organizations , March of Dimes type , uh , telethons or , or bicycle rides or whatever , how they fund whatever , uh , illness they wish ."
22713,sw2353,sd,"I think I , um , have read recently that , uh , the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps ."
165270,sw3296,sd,But I use my P C there mostly for creating legal documents .
179141,sw3509,sd,"but on the other hand it 's , it 's fairly impressive to watch them , you know , walk into the room with gallows ."
138847,sw2086,sd,"and then it ,"
72770,sw4834,sd,"because they , a lot of times they dial sequentially ."
188125,sw2184,sd,"And so I can see from the company 's standpoint that there , uh ,"
97635,sw2648,sd,"and , you know , their reg- , their regulation that 's placed on them is , I mean , it 's better than it used to be"
21364,sw4078,sd,I went to school there at Abilene Christian
38592,sw3496,sd,"and we were there in the fall before the snows , you know , started"
180020,sw4792,sd,I 've got some friends that are lawyers
47117,sw2830,sd,"um , I like things like I just mentioned ,"
102305,sw2549,sd,"It 's , um , a couple of blocks west ."
37349,sw2562,sd,"Well , the first thing we always plant is tomatoes --"
209166,sw2548,sd,I was n't even looking for a car when I bought this car .
145730,sw4565,sd,"Well , I think , I think his sleep book is my favorite ."
105469,sw3355,sd,"I took lessons for thirteen years ,"
35593,sw2679,sd,I guess I 'm thinking of the easy thing to do --
175480,sw2331,sd,"And I said , Well , yeah , you know ,"
107617,sw2992,sd,"I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen , is it Brochco , who does like L A LAW --"
57543,sw3694,sd,when I drive down --
138243,sw2248,sd,"But not on a , on the regular basis ."
81493,sw2434,sd,"Uh , the ammunition is probably so old I 'm afraid to use it ."
133204,sw2387,sd,"Well , I primarily listen to classical music when I have my druthers , partly because I find it more soothing ."
119390,sw2797,sd,"So if you 're renting a house or doing anything else , you 're not actually contributing to the education of your children ."
119275,sw3845,sd,"we live in the Dallas area , Richardson ."
121106,sw2187,sd,And I get the milk lukewarm
89282,sw4728,sd,so I got a Four Runner .
164512,sw2266,sd,"like at work , we 'd have a T V or whatever ."
194629,sw3154,sd,"and , I 'm --"
60619,sw2433,sd,"and , and , you know , this is one of those things ,"
123140,sw3402,sd,"and so , uh , I enjoy watching some of the T V highlights and also , uh , some of the news periodicals , uh , weekly magazines ,"
97989,sw2362,sd,I was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with
97188,sw3697,sd,"I 'm , well , we 're starting out a new one ,"
119430,sw2797,sd,"I , I know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland , uh ,"
197980,sw2028,sd,I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday .
149659,sw4812,sd,"You know , I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell"
160452,sw2427,sd,"We used to do it at home when I was a kid ,"
207740,sw3146,sd,and their veal dishes have been good .
29983,sw2524,sd,"they 're like dolls ,"
15636,sw3166,sd,It 's about an inch and a half long
601,sw2278,sd,I 'm only up here for school .
64932,sw2782,sd,You do n't want the government to spend your money .
192059,sw2789,sd,most of the guys were all in one class
206679,sw3682,sd,Or maybe it 's only half hour .
179435,sw2568,sd,I have n't .
106600,sw2079,sd,"and we had thought before maybe a lot older we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it ,"
141559,sw2448,sd,"Uh , they were bragging about it ,"
213074,sw2772,sd,"for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool ."
149754,sw2587,sd,"and by the time everything is settled in ,"
198661,sw2061,sd,so they have this think tank .
199538,sw2628,sd,"I , uh , I , I like the way it is ."
85168,sw3069,sd,"I , I do n't really have the time to read the whole thing ,"
10482,sw3754,sd,it is commercialized .
183304,sw4133,sd,"the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based on the , uh , person who is accused ."
41714,sw2942,sd,and four years after that I got another master 's degree .
32416,sw2884,sd,"But , you know , there goes my savings ."
140007,sw2570,sd,"So , uh , you know , I did n't have access to a machine the whole time I was in college ."
198092,sw2028,sd,"Well , really it , uh , the letter just says , um ,"
8799,sw2354,sd,but but I think I would always think that no matter what I did
65245,sw2533,sd,"and if there 's a game on , he 's watching it ."
57760,sw3448,sd,he 's black
92199,sw2566,sd,"and , of course , it was beautiful and ,"
204939,sw3171,sd,and then we rented a car for two weeks
107791,sw2992,sd,I try to limit what they watch .
18233,sw4788,sd,we just kind of did what we wanted --
135418,sw2661,sd,"And they had ,"
189431,sw2395,sd,"You know , one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C ,"
127083,sw2952,sd,"My parents go camping a lot ,"
63452,sw3051,sd,"So , they just watched the water pour in on the carpet ."
72762,sw4834,sd,Or you do tell them you 're not interested
213685,sw3186,sd,"And , um , it 's great ,"
75901,sw2072,sd,I did n't see that many of them .
35429,sw3257,sd,"-- and , uh , otherwise , of course my husband 's into the football --"
119366,sw3845,sd,"and then , you know , people asking for , for money for everything , you know ,"
4833,sw2711,sd,They go upstairs and have their morning coffee .
169060,sw2316,sd,"and we had a vocational , uh , electronics in our high school ."
179990,sw4792,sd,"I could , I could n't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing ."
104238,sw4056,sd,"I work in , I 'm a , on the professional administrative and technical staff ,"
212903,sw2772,sd,and the fog never makes it that far .
11041,sw4721,sd,Everybody 's on their way to someplace --
156180,sw4013,sd,"we were at a soccer game Saturday ,"
75203,sw3155,sd,"Uh . Oh , it 's supposed to be a real scary one ."
164001,sw2691,sd,"So it wo n't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home ,"
138994,sw3234,sd,"and we just looked all over for it and could n't find it ,"
84886,sw2527,sd,"I mean , it 's just almost surreal , in some places ."
209433,sw3514,sd,"I mean , I was n't a great asset to them or anything ."
107213,sw3473,sd,"and that takes about , really about , maybe about thirteen minutes , uh --"
106555,sw2079,sd,"but , uh , he built us a house ,"
25166,sw2889,sd,It came out really dark .
129749,sw2736,sd,"Now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back ,"
56669,sw3076,sd,I know that my late husband was simply indifferent .
14343,sw2930,sd,appreciate it .
13825,sw2368,sd,"but mostly if it 's something major , um , you know , cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that , we just hire out to do that ,"
118651,sw2766,sd,The French were there .
62644,sw2499,sd,"It 's just , uh , it 's just so realistic . Everything they do ."
74347,sw2719,sd,And my husband had a lot of heartburn with that .
36878,sw3061,sd,"And , um ,"
26373,sw3013,sd,it seems like most people like spaghetti .
75622,sw2870,sd,"Well he is just , he is really active still politically ."
51964,sw3363,sd,And it 's right on the arm rest in the back --
64246,sw3525,sd,I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more
132669,sw3587,sd,"Um , well , let 's see . I just , I mean , I just like to go"
133662,sw2235,sd,"Including new vans ,"
199660,sw2628,sd,"I know , I know nobody around here does , it ,"
41757,sw3181,sd,but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight .
35600,sw2679,sd,"You know , the breakfasts and ,"
135102,sw3105,sd,"so , I , I do feel strongly about ."
39940,sw2511,sd,"I mean , of course , I loved it , um ,"
206585,sw3682,sd,And it 's pretty cool .
13155,sw4630,sd,Makes sense .
128219,sw2122,sd,"it 's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a , on a P C ."
212926,sw2772,sd,It 's not really been too bad .
45938,sw2662,sd,"It 's the behavioral science part of communication ,"
119554,sw2797,sd,but they do n't have it anymore .
6316,sw2308,sd,"So , um , it 's strange , because it , it so , hit so close to home that um , my father 's an only child ,"
31915,sw2205,sd,"I , I 'm , I 'm inveterate switcher ."
144153,sw2249,sd,"so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so- ,"
100537,sw2264,sd,She 'll be two in July .
67301,sw2260,sd,It drives me crazy .
65590,sw2010,sd,"and yeah ,"
134089,sw2999,sd,"but we prefer g- ,"
153772,sw2005,sd,and they actually had a conference .
195486,sw4109,sd,"If you do n't want to , you know , uh , talk about it now and then --"
116735,sw3096,sd,But we have got more women in it now .
147695,sw4785,sd,We try to spend Saturdays together .
207377,sw4880,sd,"For example , uh , uh , well , uh , uh , train engineers ."
139843,sw2376,sd,"and it 's amazing how much stuff j- , just the two of us generate ,"
65464,sw2010,sd,I have n't .
189868,sw3086,sd,"no we do n't have the MUMBLEx ,"
121562,sw2027,sd,"and it said , these are the color pastel shirts you may wear , or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and , hair just this way ."
117779,sw2514,sd,"also , uh , uh , Mexico , uh , we will loan the money in uh ,"
105854,sw2616,sd,"And you know like he sent planes over to , to shoot the people down that were on the border with , uh , tha , that were on their way to Turkey ."
103991,sw3049,sd,"I 've , uh ,"
93480,sw3513,sd,"it never snows down here ,"
75279,sw3425,sd,"but um , there are some parts during that exercise that I think , I can not do another --"
115042,sw2887,sd,"I think E D S has seven to , to eight years ."
8559,sw2528,sd,"always right , right before the news is when I catch them ."
146390,sw2965,sd,"and it really , it really added up ."
182436,sw4682,sd,So we got the kind we wanted
78640,sw2053,sd,so hopefully this year he 'll have one .
5072,sw3233,sd,"So I 've been doing very little reading , except I , I did finally dip into a couple of biographies . Um , all of sort of literary figures of this century ."
14740,sw2342,sd,"Turns out , you do n't , you do n't , you do n't really find bagels in Israel ."
118786,sw2900,sd,"and they are , um , of an advanced years ,"
97460,sw3503,sd,"they , they drove up ,"
74723,sw2445,sd,"I ca n't see all this little , uh , smoke buckets I call them ,"

99667,sw2226,sd,"Uh , his last name ends in a Z , I know that ."
198351,sw3962,sd,"But they also , uh , they also , uh , go to the different composers , or the different , I guess ,"
200309,sw4019,sd,He ca n't --
99784,sw2226,sd,And I have gone back
101568,sw2710,sd,I mean there 's no point in giving them any more money than we have to .
2595,sw2289,sd,"and I see it ,"
1986,sw2788,sd,and we found a preschool for him .
209992,sw3251,sd,"-- but the , the ice storms really are stressful on all the , the plants that we have around ."
34032,sw2190,sd,"I 'm not certain that that was ,"
160577,sw3419,sd,now I have n't eaten there .
172507,sw3085,sd,and she was excited about it
109439,sw2313,sd,"I let my wife take the checkbook ,"
110841,sw3190,sd,we do .
150646,sw2078,sd,"Oh , I enjoyed it ."
133169,sw2301,sd,"Now , there are times when you 'd --"
151471,sw3047,sd,"I , I was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year ."
111098,sw3453,sd,"I too- , I drove it from here to Memphis"
185996,sw2945,sd,"in the beginning when he , uh , he was transferred to a , a larger plant"
175019,sw2970,sd,And it was really disgusting .
73069,sw3639,sd,because they 're talking like it was an American built car .
82892,sw2503,sd,"I , I 'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time ."
12920,sw2776,sd,My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
6741,sw3803,sd,"We had , you know , had shotguns for , for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that ."
77571,sw4733,sd,"It 's I T B S or , and , uh , just everything , everything ."
65998,sw2913,sd,"Um , we 're late twenties ."
23080,sw2621,sd,"I 'd , I never was , you know , too , a whole lot of , a big fan , you know ."
75002,sw2160,sd,"and he had enough money to , you know ,"
47390,sw2830,sd,I use to watch that
122953,sw2647,sd,"it 's a large city , ,"
6854,sw3253,sd,"Oh , but , you know , I 'm going to try ."
181865,sw3633,sd,And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics .
205997,sw3108,sd,"so it 's ,"
209230,sw2548,sd,"but I just , I worry about who 's driven them and what they 've been through and the warranties and things like that ."
185549,sw4362,sd,"I 'm , I 'm just graduating col- , graduating from college ."
184060,sw4319,sd,"Uh , they do n't cover eyes though ,"
20326,sw2478,sd,"Well we 're in the metroplex here , you know ,"
14732,sw2342,sd,"actually my house is Kosher ,"
58772,sw3310,sd,"and she 's been in the nursing home now for , oh , I would say about three months ."
36050,sw3686,sd,It was a Cadillac .
159538,sw2466,sd,I 'm writing it down .
101878,sw3254,sd,though --
127065,sw2952,sd,"it is not , it is not fun ."
207772,sw3146,sd,It was wonderful
146558,sw3825,sd,"and , you know , a lot of that sort of thing ."
76547,sw2365,sd,"and it seemed like there was , it was a good sized den with a lot panelling"
68210,sw2032,sd,I did n't go then .
84842,sw2527,sd,"actually the , the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh ."
22722,sw2353,sd,"and some of the are the overseas programs . Uh ,"
202842,sw2429,sd,"but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time ,"
138453,sw2713,sd,"and he said usually you 'll get approved anyway because they just want your money , they want your card ."
198569,sw2061,sd,"They go , well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it"
78591,sw2053,sd,I got to counting the other day
36804,sw3061,sd,"and , um , she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy ."
105398,sw3355,sd,"Of course , Garth Brooks lives about , uh , you know ,"
163167,sw2874,sd,"sometimes they 've had two on , you know , one on every hook ."
122231,sw2071,sd,"I like , I like some of those things ."
188487,sw3917,sd,And --
71728,sw2220,sd,"Well , especially with something where you have to f- , you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt ."
83534,sw2672,sd,and they brought it down to the shelters .
141761,sw2393,sd,"It 's pretty remarkable because growing up we 've always had a beautiful , lush green lawn ,"
133231,sw2387,sd,"My husband is ,"
59135,sw3489,sd,"and when you throw trash away , you throw it in my yard ."
38473,sw2692,sd,"It , it ,"
177714,sw4608,sd,I have a good friend there .
179545,sw3015,sd,"so , we went to the , to the , the medical insurance that we have at , here at work ,"
49422,sw3028,sd,And stuff like that .
128538,sw2622,sd,"I mean , I would n't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it were n't for the fact that they do n't , they do n't go to any place ."
24466,sw3231,sd,and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny --
81747,sw2434,sd,"Uh , we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have ."
57412,sw3855,sd,"And then , um , you know , we really do n't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later --"
161422,sw3693,sd,"So I stopped that after a year , because it was difficult --"
188876,sw4171,sd,"And , uh , I do n't know what they do for those people ."
187848,sw4353,sd,and she 's good at it .
135373,sw2661,sd,We do the same thing .
39934,sw2511,sd,there 's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars .
165559,sw2717,sd,"Um , you know , he would come home"
45134,sw2578,sd,"But I , I would n't want to go out and buy it like , you know , the hard back copy of it ."
175189,sw2970,sd,How to carry --
109776,sw2300,sd,"We want to next time pay cash for our car , too ."
184246,sw3073,sd,"I ,"
98189,sw2008,sd,"Um , actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse , um , and flat shoes ."
56221,sw3185,sd,"Well , I usually like it about sweater weather ,"
1531,sw2325,sd,So I just finally took him out . Plus financial reasons .
10464,sw3754,sd,"See now , that is where I want to go ."
138806,sw2086,sd,I just do n't like squash .
52960,sw2339,sd,I 've done it in a shelter .
144647,sw3082,sd,and --
132578,sw3587,sd,and we went up to Lake Bonham and really enjoyed it .
117738,sw2514,sd,"they do n't have oil or anything ,"
161209,sw3332,sd,"we just do n't , uh , go there --"
184420,sw4028,sd,"um , I guess we 're going to talk , describe , uh , job benefits ,"
175451,sw2331,sd,"-- and since then , uh , we 've made it , um ,"
132749,sw4443,sd,the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf .
119966,sw3926,sd,"It was brand new ,"
115695,sw3030,sd,"and so we sort of did n't , did n't continue it ,"
144228,sw2249,sd,But they want any clean and dry plastic bag
154386,sw2603,sd,And I love the water aerobics .
124075,sw3065,sd,"I , I learned that because , uh , a friend of mine ,"
61266,sw2124,sd,"Anyway , but I asked ,"
82981,sw2703,sd,"I really enjoy that because it 's kind of a , a getaway type thing ."
166430,sw2860,sd,"but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things ,"
11417,sw3055,sd,"well , talk about working with big amounts of pie crust , and having it be tough ."
213369,sw4175,sd,"I mean , Kroger does a couple things ."
14327,sw2930,sd,but we just did n't get out .
200110,sw2729,sd,"And she 's so easy going and so sociable ,"
29705,sw2854,sd,"Uh , maybe after two or three or , y- , years old ."
60817,sw2433,sd,so I mean aerobics is something I 'd hate to give up .
97609,sw3503,sd,You ca n't see any prisoners
153518,sw2669,sd,"but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is , quite a bit ."
93414,sw3513,sd,"My car is really old , too ,"
78093,sw2609,sd,"Uh , it is in Australia , for example ."
108500,sw3359,sd,"and it 's actually very inexpensive ,"
74709,sw2445,sd,and then they all come out .
141738,sw2393,sd,To water it
82534,sw2131,sd,I ca n't think ever her name either .
85247,sw3069,sd,and --
129714,sw2736,sd,"I , I seem to remember when I was young that was a problem ."
53675,sw3221,sd,"-- it 's wonderful , uh ,"
119454,sw2797,sd,"and since it 's inception , uh , they 've , the price has gone up per stu- , the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty-three percent ."
206435,sw3152,sd,"so we 've had a lot of stuff , you know , friends and , and things to do with music that constant ,"
180818,sw2667,sd,"I would go faithfully ,"
81872,sw2441,sd,"I , you , you think about , you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient ,"
144752,sw3584,sd,And now I 'm a college educated builder MUMBLEx .
90064,sw2756,sd,"but there 's kind of like a little , a little thing sticking out , uh , in the Lake Michigan ,"
140452,sw2690,sd,"It took me a long time , they 're talking about the viaducts ."
101346,sw2073,sd,"I 'm , I 'm Kyle Hunt ,"
186912,sw4325,sd,"It seemed like it did ,"
189032,sw4329,sd,We live in the Saginaw area .
14256,sw2930,sd,so I like to get out by a lake --
162772,sw2921,sd,it 's ours up here .
99933,sw3093,sd,"and they are , like I say right on the beach ."
18801,sw3971,sd,"um I was mostly an A -s fan , you know ."
113919,sw2847,sd,"But , um ,"
119961,sw3926,sd,"and what happened was her husband was , uh , involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight"
123076,sw2647,sd,"a , now my grandfather was going to pay if I went to , uh , what 's now U T Arlington ,"
112127,sw2989,sd,"So , Trying to work myself out of a job ."
136723,sw3431,sd,so we did n't have a problem with that .
40357,sw2954,sd,Pretty much .
177091,sw4886,sd,"we 'd , I 've done one ,"
94003,sw2877,sd,but they 've really never used it .
22676,sw2353,sd,"I think , um , people ,"
212202,sw3266,sd,We would just lie them in there
187732,sw3135,sd,"I 've , I 've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week"
197459,sw3467,sd,I do n't have cable .
74279,sw2719,sd,"we had a lovely little house over there ,"
7010,sw3019,sd,I love to watch cooking shows .
111231,sw3368,sd,"our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me ,"
148106,sw4077,sd,I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years .
102192,sw2549,sd,What was I thinking .
178026,sw2658,sd,"But they 'll just , you know ,"
149041,sw3983,sd,"Oh , SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house , too , I forgot ,"
12014,sw2827,sd,"Um , I , um , I 'm making , some , uh ,"
169574,sw3256,sd,Well I did hear the end of the prompt this time .
35590,sw2679,sd,It 's fairly easy and fast .
79730,sw2324,sd,"and I 've had to work when I was designing packages for people ,"
122169,sw2181,sd,"and then after the movie 's over , I remember it so terribly well --"
154871,sw2584,sd,Would too .
82788,sw2503,sd,"-- so I 'm unable to , to , really take care of a pet"
146459,sw2965,sd,"and MUMBLEx you know , it ran fine ."
183028,sw4358,sd,"Uh , basically , they 're just , uh , having various recycling , uh , bins , uh , located for , uh , trash pickup ."
126870,sw2952,sd,"Oh , I , uh , like sports type things too ."
120447,sw3143,sd,"We ca n't , at least in this area , you know , they do n't have any room to put anybody"
159215,sw2526,sd,"so , it 's , it 's very authentic"
187671,sw3135,sd,"I , I lucked out with really good people both times"
46998,sw2552,sd,"you , it 's , it 's hard sometimes at work because , you know , people say , oh , we 're taking a cruise ,"
30762,sw2982,sd,"-- and , you know , times are rough now ,"
1538,sw2325,sd,"I felt safe that the kids were n't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them , you know , because --"
41467,sw3204,sd,there 's one very close to where my parents are
117219,sw2642,sd,"Because I do n't like credit cards for one thing , you know ,"
97970,sw2362,sd,"And I asked him , uh , what are you doing with that ?"
21668,sw2437,sd,"As contract person we have to do random drug testing , too ."
57354,sw2237,sd,"Bermuda seems to be pretty ,"
214243,sw3324,sd,"just getting out in the front , and just being outside is good for them"
100604,sw2832,sd,"Well I 'm originally from , uh , Ohio , Cincinnati ,"

72598,sw3691,sd,"Oh , have a ball with them ."
100831,sw2832,sd,and the light would come on
3000,sw3034,sd,"I 'm not sure where all my pins came from ,"

6350,sw2308,sd,a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations .

103095,sw2197,sd,"I mean it 's more money that I make in a year ,"
88259,sw4859,sd,So that 's why I concentrate on weekly magazines .

105901,sw2616,sd,Ninety-two .

107163,sw3473,sd,I do it every day on a regular basis .
196038,sw2775,sd,"I mean , I got probably the biggest ,"
41074,sw3570,sd,-- and see we 've yet to keep anyone up over --
150562,sw2078,sd,and it 's just ten children at a time .
202028,sw2477,sd,"It was a very close game , and hard fought game ."
100327,sw2397,sd,"and it 's a wildlife ,"
62653,sw2499,sd,They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they 're raised .

70278,sw2792,sd,"But see I do crafts too ,"
169966,sw3070,sd,"Well , in my family , let 's see , last October was the forty fifth annual --"
23699,sw3214,sd,"but , uh --"

29942,sw2524,sd,I like volleyball .
108207,sw3537,sd,"And they said that in Canada , there were as many heart , uh , trauma centers as there is in San Francisco ."
197151,sw4877,sd,"and they let her bring her , her little daughter in for free ."
133660,sw2235,sd,And they pay cash for everything they buy .
58450,sw2467,sd,"and I 'm a half hour ,"

204928,sw3171,sd,It was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country
95238,sw2435,sd,"-- and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea . Because they , they make bundles of money off those things ."

32391,sw2884,sd,"Um , but my wife has a real job ."
183986,sw4366,sd,but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore .
77153,sw2734,sd,"I believe you 're right , though ."
146512,sw3825,sd,"and people would come from Seattle to there and , uh , let 's see , Nevada and in that area , Washington and Nevada to southern Utah"

49761,sw3167,sd,I 've tried it
101146,sw3202,sd,So the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together .

46160,sw3104,sd,"our last daughter , she did not want to go to school ."
53802,sw2155,sd,"So , that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as I see these things --"
137246,sw3543,sd,"By firing squad , as I recall ."
1046,sw2040,sd,"so , I was very cut off from the , the press as I , you know , and be , was becoming an adult ."
178272,sw3259,sd,you always stand in line when you go --
209476,sw3514,sd,that was nice .
191618,sw4336,sd,there 's a T V and a V C R
198882,sw4090,sd,"but and divide those up between all ,"
125901,sw3791,sd,we still got some from last year .
190619,sw2593,sd,so my spare time usually involves something with the kids .
57391,sw3855,sd,"that 's how I fe ,"
163616,sw4858,sd,"And , uh , but on the whole I think it , uh , probably was the wrong thing to do ."
112192,sw2519,sd,"and , you know , I had , I did that ,"
34814,sw2373,sd,-- we drive sixty-five .
172228,sw2139,sd,"And , uh , of course there 's another aspect of this , too , uh , in terms of invasion of privacy"
46499,sw3747,sd,he plays in the Fort Worth Symphony and Fort Worth mostly .
107768,sw2992,sd,so . Anyway . I do n't know if our five minutes are over yet .
3381,sw2614,sd,And there 's got to be trade .
7608,sw3424,sd,Now I 'm to the MUMBLEx mother was --
113822,sw2847,sd,"And then he did , uh , HE , HE , HEALING THE SHAME THAT BINDS YOU ,"
125038,sw2996,sd,"and somebody that went with me bought a carton for , uh , ten dollars and something"
184829,sw3830,sd,I just read this in the paper the other day .
17513,sw3042,sd,"It 's like , wow , it actually fell on the right day ."
136328,sw2652,sd,but my ironing board is part of my decor
127344,sw2726,sd,"an , and a dining room is separate ,"
33682,sw2386,sd,"Well , I have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom , but it usually 's holding clothes ."
143254,sw3491,sd,"Considering that Spock was on an , uh , you know , couple weeks ago --"

164142,sw2436,sd,We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it .

165025,sw3727,sd,They have not been too bad .
17685,sw3158,sd,"It 's funny , when you were talking about sewing , I love to do anything by hand with a needle ."
158539,sw2608,sd,"I use , uh , uh , the black iron skillet to cook mine ."
51696,sw3025,sd,He tried to make bagels one time .
89640,sw3081,sd,"well , I , I , I guess if I was having a dinner party I , depending on the number of people , I might cook a , like a brisket or a roast or a , maybe a chicken dish --"
143167,sw2405,sd,"We could , um , link in ,"
78860,sw4633,sd,"Ha- , we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and , and different areas"
41271,sw3383,sd,The reason I say that is pretty timely because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car
30296,sw3852,sd,Took off my whole front fender and hood and everything .
54703,sw2175,sd,And we just do n't want that .

41107,sw2234,sd,did n't have to pay any income tax .
49429,sw3028,sd,"Health food , uh , restaurants that ,"
132758,sw4443,sd,"Uh , one of them is the University of Florida golf course --"
134713,sw2875,sd,"and I sure would like one ever those , uh , uh , within the next five years ,"
31418,sw3527,sd,"And , uh , and , uh , I do the edging and stuff like that ,"
40607,sw3847,sd,"Uh , we can water , here in Patterson , I can water on Tuesdays , Thursdays , Saturday and Sunday , four days a week ."
22959,sw2621,sd,"Uh , today , my favorites out of those guys were probably , um , Lambert ,"
9220,sw2871,sd,but I need to see it .
127843,sw4927,sd,"And , of course , they 're , this one the women would be equally grabbed"
8574,sw2528,sd,"it , it 's , um , eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here in New York ."
93432,sw3513,sd,"so ,"
167578,sw2615,sd,so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it .
178815,sw3550,sd,and that 's a Legend --
203775,sw2604,sd,"But I see , I , I see so much going on that , that 's bad ."
68440,sw3333,sd,lots of their picture and life story and everything .
161662,sw3004,sd,"So , um ,"
126160,sw3191,sd,"Uh , she was probably the only person in the , um , whole nursing home that , uh , still had all of her mental facilities about her ."
127187,sw2952,sd,and I will find that thing .
48039,sw2744,sd,"an , but now , now , that he 's in this program and , you know , he 's , I guess okay ,"
198534,sw2061,sd,"Oh , you know I like what I 'm doing right now ."
108435,sw3225,sd,"Me , either ."
24585,sw3231,sd,My husband liked that --
51702,sw3025,sd,"and the dog never , you know , he treated it like a milk bone"
133387,sw2387,sd,"and when our first child was , you know , an infant , um , of course , when I was around the house , I played that music , too ."
90467,sw2366,sd,"And I ,"
188660,sw4060,sd,"so there is a progressive path ,"
17234,sw2191,sd,it was a lot of sweat
107955,sw2065,sd,"and basically it was a , uh , repayment for , for , uh , high school education ,"
113430,sw2969,sd,"And I will get , uh ,"
122380,sw3384,sd,and that 's real hard .
148847,sw3338,sd,"-- and I enter things in our little state fair ,"
44585,sw2950,sd,I avoid the sun .
129074,sw3007,sd,"what you see shown and bred now as Golden Retrievers , this , you know , plus eighty to a hundred pound range ."
209917,sw3251,sd,"and working in that condo , you did n't have to do anything --"
120507,sw3143,sd,"but I 've never had any personal , you know , I never met anybody that I knew had anything to do with it ."
137056,sw3050,sd,I get a random reimbursement every now and then and do n't really --
70770,sw2460,sd,"I mean they 're a , it 's a small market"
125433,sw2631,sd,"I , I 've seen the same thing"
78250,sw2609,sd,"and there are cases when you do n't want that to be the case . Um ,"
197140,sw4877,sd,And I have three granddaughters right now .
192066,sw2789,sd,"Well , now they have those , uh , those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight ,"
200787,sw3441,sd,"Um , my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen MUMBLEx"
196461,sw4103,sd,but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date .
95346,sw2785,sd,"Uh , many of those tanned until the last couple when , uh , we had such an economic slowdown ."
103749,sw3408,sd,it 's just only was three more classes --
121333,sw2309,sd,"I did , I did also ."
100153,sw2397,sd,"I do crochet and a lot of , uh , things like that ,"
25712,sw2898,sd,That 's what happened to this guy .
66974,sw3294,sd,"Uh , and I also sort of worry that , you know , that sometimes people giveaway personal information ."
12820,sw2776,sd,"I used to , uh , get into it and get out of it based on my schedule ,"
40788,sw3455,sd,"It was sad , very sad ."
88700,sw2336,sd,"and I , I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again ,"
152595,sw3524,sd,"Well , I certainly hope so ."
27296,sw3271,sd,"and the cat would sleep on my husband 's side , you know ."
182433,sw4682,sd,"And I said , well put it on because apparently nothing 's guaranteed"
180242,sw2627,sd,"and so we , we were thinking we wanted to do , you know , we were going to try doing it ourselves ,"
61388,sw2279,sd,-- and that was the most boring place on earth .
126167,sw3191,sd,"Uh , my , my dad 's mother is an invalid ,"
51790,sw3025,sd,"And , uh , I had this wonderful recipe"
213169,sw3142,sd,Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner --
52693,sw2339,sd,"I was thinking about camping and different i- , people 's ideas about it ."
24783,sw2623,sd,and I never saw him .
40070,sw3280,sd,and it got so depressing .
45854,sw2662,sd,"and , and , and that was , that , that helped us sort of feel good about , you know , about ourselves and about MUMBLEx one around us , in that at least , at least , if everyone 's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that , at least they 're still going to see the real good movies , you know ."
149625,sw4812,sd,"and I went through a , a pretty , I do n't know , I went through a , standard drug testing thing before I , I was brought on ."
182411,sw4682,sd,But that 's it .
184255,sw3073,sd,"We generally just stay on one channel all , for all of Monday night , just to watch those ."
76902,sw4174,sd,"well , Mark , our situation is that we do have a daughter that is , uh , in the situation of choosing college ."
176593,sw2510,sd,"and , and , and that 's mainly people that have never had pets around their children ,"
66186,sw2913,sd,I want to see that .
39604,sw2935,sd,"I love gardens that are well tended ,"
90756,sw2252,sd,it 's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine .
51026,sw3014,sd,"Probably , um , uh , let 's see , I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car ."
124729,sw2963,sd,And I just quit too .
37531,sw3352,sd,"-- uh , I 'm originally from the State of Virginia --"
35612,sw2679,sd,"Different rice and ham and things that , uh ,"
109463,sw2313,sd,And they make more money if you extend your loan .
49502,sw3028,sd,That 's one of my husband 's pet peeves .
16386,sw3059,sd,"and I 'd have to say , uh , I , uh , I do n't know ."
20854,sw3102,sd,"And now , I did not go out a lot"
47363,sw2830,sd,That guy that was a reporter for C N N .
29265,sw2292,sd,"and , because , like I say , we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long ,"
95200,sw2435,sd,"that , and plus , I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt ."
88059,sw3115,sd,"So I 'll be , I 'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because I 'm , I 'm , if I 'm going to be down on the floor messing with them , I 'm not going to wear nylons and , you know --"
104392,sw4723,sd,"When you sat in the seats , they adjusted to fit around you ."
140774,sw2178,sd,"but , uh , kind of had the feeling along that , uh ,"
2905,sw3034,sd,"I mean , I 'm , I 'm , I can understand baseball , you know ,"
146522,sw3825,sd,"And then they just sort of do like a little program or , you know , something like that so --"

119590,sw2797,sd,"I forget what it was called , uh ,"
107896,sw3196,sd,and so we charged them all up again .
75891,sw2072,sd,"in fact , when my children were growing up , we always had horses"
76843,sw3811,sd,"and , and that 's really what we 've learned about it ."
143663,sw3286,sd,"-- and with his limited English they found out , thr- , you know , that , she was in student council ,"
156783,sw2678,sd,"because Baltimore will play more , uh , what might be considered m- , a little bit more progressive ?"
53947,sw2155,sd,"then they had , they had the choice , you know ,"

139749,sw2376,sd,they ca n't get to the these centers .

194069,sw3707,sd,"and , uh , you know , it was a group class , outside ."

54575,sw2879,sd,"on some days , uh , it 's , uh , I do n't know"
177265,sw3168,sd,"Well , that scares me because if th- , that 's the way they are ,"
201195,sw4074,sd,"Uh , I never felt like it was mine or anything ,"
50133,sw2917,sd,"we had cre- , I had probably twenty credit cards --"
106322,sw2806,sd,"You had to be sure you left the doors open , you know ,"
91470,sw4159,sd,"I 'm not talking about your isolated occurrences ,"
32749,sw3016,sd,"We once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number ,"
20670,sw2812,sd,"and I 'm twenty-three ,"
12909,sw2776,sd,"and now they 're saying what 's cholesterol ,"
98486,sw3088,sd,"And I do n't have a problem at all with employers , uh , testing in the hiring process ,"
127498,sw2726,sd,"There , there are tons of apartments down here , I mean ,"
5591,sw2944,sd,"I , I , you know , I mean I think of the young girl in Florida who ,"

63288,sw2545,sd,ours is a Commodore One Twenty-eight .
213013,sw2772,sd,They have rolling hills around here
5992,sw3265,sd,It was real interesting .
175979,sw3246,sd,"but I 'm really having questions if , if I can deal with that system and , and have a good conscience about , you know , what I do ."
127576,sw2726,sd,"I , I saw , I see that a lot too , there ."
134765,sw2875,sd,"I 've , I 've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike ,"
10074,sw2716,sd,"I guess that 's what 's happening to me ,"
192525,sw4168,sd,"And , and I liked , uh , Aerosmith and --"
114230,sw2431,sd,"and , uh , they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty ."
137215,sw2006,sd,It 's a heck of a lot different .
7990,sw2770,sd,"so my cat was trained to go outside ,"
206928,sw3201,sd,"And , of course , they have the , um , dumpsters , uh , the , the igloos ."
114308,sw2431,sd,"I mean it was a big one ,"
210077,sw2370,sd,"and , and it just drove me crazy ."
184377,sw3073,sd,"I do n't have time to sit , I know ."
36374,sw2389,sd,"like they still get their allowance ,"
36689,sw2457,sd,that would be awful .
200450,sw4079,sd,"Actually , well actually there is a , a way ,"
83985,sw2465,sd,"It seems like it 's changed so much ,"
32668,sw3016,sd,"So , I really feel that it is a real invasion , they 're invading my time and my space --"
208182,sw2759,sd,I did n't know that .
47217,sw2830,sd,"but I like the N B A play-offs ,"
213094,sw2772,sd,So it 's been good .
79403,sw3638,sd,they made it to the playoffs finally
142760,sw3646,sd,"They say you kind of act how you 're dressed a little bit ,"
83475,sw4725,sd,"I , I do n't work ."
199789,sw2399,sd,"I , I try to refrain from their use as much as possible . Um , for a number of reasons , one of which is the , you know , extreme interest rate on most of them ."
161587,sw3004,sd,"Well , nannies have been an option , uh ,"
185805,sw4330,sd,"and , uh , actually bec- , beforehand they told me they were going to , uh , do drug screening ,"
104157,sw3049,sd,"It was the one where he was a defense ,"
134924,sw2875,sd,"and now again , I 've got three vehicles"
145097,sw2372,sd,"but I was , I was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better"
202489,sw4150,sd,So that 's how we spent most of the time with him .
122406,sw3384,sd,It 's full time work .
49447,sw3028,sd,"They do list , um , you know , list the fat ,"
212361,sw3080,sd,"-- so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner ,"
112077,sw2989,sd,"because I remember our family , well , we , we , we went everywhere ."
85400,sw2472,sd,it still echoes .
64310,sw3525,sd,"Off , now , off the tee ."
40804,sw3455,sd,"And it , it was a real good movie ."
124704,sw2963,sd,"And since then we have lost , oh , well , just our grandmother ."
92135,sw2566,sd,"But now that I 'm there , I mean , it 's , it 's a lot more convenient because there 's so many kids that doddle ."
76287,sw3124,sd,"I mean it was great after growing up in Michigan and not , and al- , you know , every day was cloudy ,"
141005,sw2178,sd,it was something like discuss pollution .
31811,sw3293,sd,"And I know if I go home and say , oh , let 's go camping , my --"
76573,sw2365,sd,"we , we built a shed over the long way ,"
18048,sw2303,sd,"Oh , I did n't realize that actually ."
22533,sw2353,sd,"and I be , I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our ,"
142313,sw3020,sd,"tha- , I highly recommend that way to go ."
129999,sw2110,sd,"I like the idea of , uh , being , uh , a mandatory thing for welfare ."
119450,sw2797,sd,and then they go into the fourth grade
47409,sw2830,sd,"And they say well , they 're trying to deduce what he or she is ,"
136748,sw3431,sd,It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings --
141564,sw2448,sd,and it 's working well .
48199,sw2744,sd,"and I , I feel like I got a good college education"
195152,sw4181,sd,"if the , if the , if people lose their jobs , then they become a load"
195255,sw4378,sd,"And , and then materials coming in --"
162910,sw2921,sd,"they 're s , going to start to see their return --"
72117,sw3576,sd,"And , well , when we leave the doors open , they fly in the house ."
13789,sw2368,sd,I do n't have an ethnic maid .
36823,sw3061,sd,but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her .
75529,sw2870,sd,"not that I think he was good looking ,"
139385,sw2630,sd,My other son is just as happy as a bed bug .
120483,sw3143,sd,"but you know , they , one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them , you know , you wo n't have a record because you 're under eighteen ."
57823,sw3448,sd,"I ca n't remember what it 's even called now ,"
98791,sw2275,sd,"and then they 'd pull it back ,"
84983,sw3069,sd,"I , um , gosh , I ca n't even think ."
143948,sw2492,sd,"We had fleas in our yard real bad last year ,"
155094,sw2584,sd,"and it 's interesting ,"
10767,sw2090,sd,"I 've done , um , little commercials and background singing"
27140,sw2821,sd,"we went to one Italian ,"
150037,sw3725,sd,"So , unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together , it is kind of like ."
98402,sw3660,sd,Sam 's is part of Wal-Mart .
94160,sw2602,sd,"And my reasons are based upon not only from what I read in the newspapers , what I see on the newspapers , but up against some of the , fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group ."
114307,sw2431,sd,this was a big one .
8656,sw3405,sd,and last year was the first year we tried two new things .
172565,sw3085,sd,now my older son was adopted
59598,sw2344,sd,Everybody else but one has been in Texas .
41533,sw3204,sd,but he needed the medical treatment
106277,sw2806,sd,And then in the summertime you could put him out
209557,sw2305,sd,"Um , and from that point I went to law school ."
114051,sw4080,sd,"I do n't know ,"
119697,sw2283,sd,it 's gone .
162276,sw3175,sd,"I do n't , I do n't , I , you know , I 'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends ."
43252,sw2767,sd,"Act- , but , you know , I say that"
150851,sw3207,sd,"I , I --"
115852,sw3030,sd,"You know you can always make it hotter ,"
26901,sw2821,sd,but one of our favorites is Pappasito 's .
131318,sw3063,sd,"Well , I know , uh , uh , in Michigan , uh , the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it ,"
58568,sw2467,sd,"-- but Plano , maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas ."
74718,sw2445,sd,We just sort of lit them .
50299,sw2917,sd,"You know , and , and I mean , it was , I thought a lot ,"
77214,sw2734,sd,"If I was in a public restaurant , seated at table with , uh , non smokers I would try to pick a s- , a , a my , seat where the smoke would blow away from them ."
138971,sw3234,sd,"Well , it 's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society ."
84414,sw2382,sd,"I mean , that beats any offer I 've heard in a long time ."
45230,sw2578,sd,"like , we just bought a new house ,"
210935,sw4099,sd,"but it got too expensive ,"
61441,sw2279,sd,"he , like he , you know , like he wants to be best friends now --"
46813,sw2552,sd,"on Monday nights we set aside time where it 's called , uh , family home evening"
188316,sw2184,sd,"And they , at that time , they had no testing whatsoever ."
95821,sw3235,sd,-- and I have a tendency to work late .
72894,sw3606,sd,for a while I 'll ask people if they know what happened --
86468,sw2479,sd,"but she , she 's gone three mornings ."
127818,sw4927,sd,The draft age .
98002,sw2362,sd,"Uh , most the time if they were , they were ,"
34213,sw2190,sd,"and so people move out one more valley and ,"
99453,sw3850,sd,"See , that was a rerun ."
212203,sw3266,sd,and they roll real well and maneuver .
32243,sw2432,sd,They could n't put anything in it hardly .
165052,sw3720,sd,"Oh , plus we watch a little T V together ."
62639,sw2499,sd,"Oh , that is , that is the most precious movie ."
65348,sw2533,sd,"we 're expecting our first baby ,"
29230,sw2292,sd,"but we have been able to find do- , dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays ."
51881,sw3363,sd,And the thing about it is --
114525,sw3330,sd,It 'll save me a lot of money because I 'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition --
7588,sw3424,sd,"Well , so many of us came from a long way that we , we 'd usually at a motel"
51630,sw3025,sd,"So , if you are looking for a French recipe , that was good ."
51152,sw3014,sd,"You know , there 's nothing in there that can wrap around the , the , uh , rollers or anything ."
106481,sw3675,sd,"You know , uh , we paid cash for car ."
165710,sw2634,sd,"I said the restrictions I would like to see on , for anybody , whether it being for handgun , a rifle , a shotgun ,"
209459,sw3514,sd,French cooking .
200020,sw2729,sd,and then he got hit by a Cadillac .
55872,sw2983,sd,"and he 'll tell me what a great day he had , and about this great shot he made and everything MUMBLEx ."
175282,sw2970,sd,"I mean , I , I guess I could go on and on about what to do about criminals . Uh ,"
162032,sw3533,sd,"And , uh --"
160839,sw2262,sd,Because I have family there
199802,sw2399,sd,"-- uh , at least that 's one number for this range of numbers I have , I have heard ."
50067,sw2862,sd,"here it says , uh , it says"
8903,sw2354,sd,"well the last couple of processed foods ,"
38460,sw2692,sd,"I learned because I , I just , uh , learned , you know"
162357,sw2915,sd,it is .
48948,sw2446,sd,"I was in the Peace Corps and , um ,"
165587,sw2717,sd,"well , it , it , it went pretty , pretty quick from what he said ."
207491,sw3838,sd,I have n't tried any needlepoint yet .
130281,sw3036,sd,"so , I mean , it , it , it 'll , if it stands the test of time , we 'll see ."
168525,sw2826,sd,"Uh , not that I really think that they were perfect ten , twenty , or thirty years ago ,"
58645,sw2467,sd,"and I had four non exempts , um , under me ."
208276,sw2290,sd,It looks complicated to me .
18290,sw4788,sd,"actually some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer , uh , for four days ."
79383,sw3638,sd,"and , and , uh , I 'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan ."
200455,sw4079,sd,"and besides that I , uh , you know , I have a set amount that I save every month ."
700,sw2741,sd,I have a twin sister
3279,sw2614,sd,we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything
110060,sw2268,sd,"and he said that he has never gone anywhere before ,"
211851,sw2107,sd,"And , and then when we go to sleep at night , you know , it 's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us ."
50952,sw3014,sd,"and that was just trying to hold us ,"
166393,sw2860,sd,"and the other will continue to swim in college ,"
159292,sw2526,sd,"but those are pretty stripped ,"
132554,sw2663,sd,"I 'm amazed by ,"
57575,sw3694,sd,I 'm not exactly sure what they 're burning .
127722,sw2180,sd,"I mean , I only heard portions of that"
185736,sw4330,sd,"it 's just part , it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for ."
202399,sw3242,sd,"And , you know , my children brought it to my attention ."
12873,sw2776,sd,and I 've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three .
92171,sw2566,sd,because --
36967,sw3061,sd,Probably seven or eight years .
203871,sw2604,sd,"And ,"
212419,sw3080,sd,"but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife ,"
169196,sw2316,sd,My engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T .
37335,sw2562,sd,"But out in the country , I mean ,"
76470,sw3124,sd,I mean they just go down the ice .
86266,sw2479,sd,"and , uh , we put him in Amrein 's Day Care , after ."
8004,sw2770,sd,"And dogs take a lot of , a lot more care than cats do ."
184716,sw3830,sd,"Because I , I work for myself --"
112195,sw2519,sd,"you know , by the time the final came around , I was n't even where I could wear a shoe yet ,"
73730,sw2092,sd,"We 're probably like most Am , American families , I guess , that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got at the end of the month ,"
139612,sw3087,sd,"I do n't too much ,"
112492,sw3011,sd,"you know , I do n't see that kind of sand here . Um ,"
70547,sw2460,sd,"so I adopted the , uh , uh , the Houston Astros ,"
77220,sw2734,sd,"Uh , I 'm aware of other people smoking now ."
76567,sw2365,sd,so that was n't too bad .
20489,sw2812,sd,and he asked me if I had any kids .
139146,sw2630,sd,but he did not want to be in a swim factory .
85663,sw2472,sd,I 've never heard of it .
197788,sw2145,sd,"What , in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the , the next generation or so , I guess I anticipate , uh , an increasing equality , uh , greater presence of women in management roles --"
56777,sw3076,sd,"And , uh , it , it , I think that they 're , they 're much more comfortable there ."
33778,sw2386,sd,"Retired , but ."
51403,sw2610,sd,"It 's like a fifth , like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange ."
36379,sw2389,sd,"I pay for my own life insurance ,"
30545,sw2982,sd,we actually had a little baby --
182397,sw4682,sd,"And I do n't think it was my fault because i- , I , you know , I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it"
150643,sw2078,sd,we talked about that one too .
83500,sw2672,sd,"and we put that in disposable bags ,"
6313,sw2308,sd,Now my father 's almost eighty .
204945,sw3171,sd,And it was --
92546,sw2676,sd,that 's a nice area .
22951,sw2621,sd,I really did n't care for the either two of them .
192383,sw4316,sd,"I do n't know exactly what that is ,"
210939,sw4099,sd,"Cause I know that skiing in Utah is , is suppose to be great ."
72722,sw3691,sd,"and he 'd saved up his allowance , you know , and picked him out a bird in a bird cage"
148598,sw3236,sd,"We , we save most of our aluminum cans and glass --"
4645,sw2168,sd,"he was , had an attention deficit disorder ,"
58052,sw3414,sd,"well , I have n't noticed , uh , I have n't noticed Richardson , you know , making that big a ,"
159503,sw2466,sd,"I read quite a bit , probably do n't read as much as I would like to ."
63349,sw2545,sd,"and all you have to do is just put it in a , uh , the sp- , spelling check mode ,"
146654,sw3269,sd,"I could n't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL , if I did n't ,"
187226,sw4345,sd,"I can hear it at the , uh , uh , oh , the college town nearby when I 'm in Stillwater , which is about an hour away ,"
205515,sw3595,sd,I have .
50042,sw2862,sd,"-- and , uh , I made some comment"
57660,sw3694,sd,"They 're needing to open a new landfill , or to expand onto the old landfill ."
161379,sw3693,sd,and --
34470,sw3647,sd,but that was it .
208236,sw2290,sd,"I love shark steak ,"
195548,sw4109,sd,and I 'm I 'm not a typical student .
38265,sw2692,sd,I do n't either .
54482,sw2879,sd,So many times .
162127,sw2897,sd,"but what I found recently is what they 've been doing is they , they poll somehow the area ,"
13193,sw4630,sd,"So I can be at the , at the beach when the waves start coming in ."
107629,sw2992,sd,and so --
97383,sw3403,sd,"You know , and he said , I get a kick out of it , you know ,"
119555,sw2797,sd,There 's a lot of things that they do n't do in school anymore .
126855,sw2952,sd,"Well , uh , I have two children ,"
80043,sw2015,sd,because I have my own .
117853,sw3353,sd,"Well , um , I have gone to girl 's camp a few times , as a , you know , a chaperon or a leader , whatever --"
38574,sw3496,sd,it was a four day --
159060,sw2526,sd,it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months .
181622,sw2896,sd,"Uh , one of the books that I bought , where it 's d , describing the sponge painting , said you can like layer different colors"
131566,sw3003,sd,"and , you know , and you ca n't , uh , you ca n't afford , you know , a , a car payment now ."
125219,sw2019,sd,"And he was a real , a real lovable type ,"
63535,sw3051,sd,"And it takes them something like , thirty days to complete a house ."
34539,sw3647,sd,and I 'm just really not interested in --
53372,sw3046,sd,"well as a matter of fact , I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time , because ."
203916,sw2604,sd,"so , uh ,"
27983,sw2557,sd,"and now they have to clean those up ,"
94907,sw2435,sd,SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat .
214596,sw2611,sd,"and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why , why it was ,"
208631,sw4033,sd,"Oh , ch- , see channel , where I am channel eight 's , um , like public T V ,"
51955,sw3363,sd,"So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars ,"
176339,sw4314,sd,"Probably seventies , eighties in the afternoon ."
138437,sw2713,sd,"And , uh , I do n't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a fin , a financial application , all that information on there is really not necessarily ,"
9426,sw2871,sd,"I mean I got in to it ,"
161953,sw3533,sd,We 're together a lot on special days
18994,sw2543,sd,"Um , some of the , some of the rock stations now are the , I guess the top forty stations or whatever ."
120181,sw3090,sd,"and I 'm just about ready to finish my master 's degree ,"
74998,sw2160,sd,"in one part , the guy goes out of jail ,"
119345,sw3845,sd,"-- you know , I said , this is absurd ,"
170740,sw4055,sd,but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains .
